Father, I thank you for our time together so far in this gathering of your people in worship, in hearing updates of what we're doing together and what you're doing among us, and announcements and calls to community life and activity. And now we gather as your people around the Word, and we ask for the life of your Spirit to be released in it, for transforming effect in Jesus' name. Amen. It was several weeks ago that we began this series of sermons in the early part of the summer, stimulated at least in part by the obvious physical journey we are on as a church moving from temporary place to temporary place as we anticipate our permanent home in Maple Grove. We began in that context to talk about where we believe we are not only in our physical journey, but our spiritual journey as well, and likened it to that of the people of God as recorded in Joshua chapters 1 through 3 on the shores of the Jordan River about to enter the promised land. For much like them, we see ourselves in this season of our journey as a church as being on the threshold of and about to enter into an entirely new era of life and ministry as a church, an era that we believe will be marked by in years to come, incredible opportunities for success, but dangers as well. So the word we have been embracing as being right for us and from God to us during this season of transition and waiting is the same word that God gave the people of Israel in their time of transition and waiting, just before they crossed the river on the shores of the Jordan River. The word was this. Number one, people of God, church of the open door, prepare yourselves, chapter 1, verse 11. And word number two, consecrate yourselves, chapter 3, verse 5. In other words, use this time to examine yourselves, particularly in three vitally important arenas of life, money, sex, and power. Good question would be why those three? Here's why. Because when the spies went out to view the land in chapter 2, verse 1 of Joshua, which, by the way, was a vital part of their preparation before entering the land, go view the land, chapter 2, verse 1, so we can have some idea of what we're up against, what it is we're facing, so that we can have some idea as to how to prepare and how to pray. The spies came back in the book of Joshua with this report, that the God these people serve in the land to which we are going is the God called Baal. And the worship of Baal we discovered some weeks ago is marked primarily by a disordered relationship with three things, money, sex, and power, which simply means to us this, that what the people of God were up against thousands of years ago on the shores of the Jordan River is precisely what we are up against today. For we live in a culture that is obsessed with that wholeheartedly worships in nothing short of an idolatrous way, three things, money, sex, and power. The God of the age in which we live is the God that God's people were having to fight against thousands of years ago. It's Baal. For Baal, even by a different name, even in a different culture, even in a different location, all cleaned up and suburban, is still Baal. And it's pervasive. the worship of Baal is everywhere we go it's everywhere you look and it's easier to notice when you understand what Baal really is and if you start to pay attention it can become quite overwhelming it did become quite overwhelming for me actually this week having been away for a while you kind of come back and there's a number of dynamics of re-entry that are interesting but one of them for me was simply this to get re-energized with this series we're in to kind of remind myself of why it is this is so important. And I did a number of things to do that. Early in the week, I was talking to my administrative assistant and I was asking her to do some research on some things that are coming up for me. And I was sharing this need to kind of get back into the flow of this and kind of feel in my gut why this is so important. She recommended this. She goes, Dave, if you really want to get a clear picture of Baal worship in our culture, here's what you do. You can just do this really quick. It won't take long at all. You'll be right back. It's just go to Barnes & Noble. Scan the magazine rack. Buy a few. And pay attention to what you see. In fact, what she was saying, in other words, according, if I were to just tie it into the text, what she was saying was, David, go view the land again. You've been away a few weeks. Go view the land again. And by the way, when you go to Barnes & Noble, don't go to the things that are so obvious. And she didn't have to tell me, don't go by Playboy. But don't do the things that obviously are in the plastic wrapper. Don't go to Penthouse. Don't go to Hustler. Do mainstream stuff. Look at Harper's Bazaar, 17 Magazine, Cosmopolitan Magazine. Look at Teen Style Magazine. Look at the stuff that people read. Look at the stuff that kids read. Look at the stuff that maybe kids in your church read. Look at not the out there stuff that everybody would try to avoid. Look at the stuff that's at the grocery checkouts. Center. It'll give you a picture. But pay attention. I thought it was a good idea. End of the day, I was on my way to Barnes & Noble thinking this was a good idea. I had a second thought. How do I do this? How do I stand in Barnes & Noble? I don't know if you know what it feels like to be me, but people sometimes know me and I don't know them. There I am at Barnes & Noble in a magazine rack looking at Cosmopolitan. Hey, Pastor Dave, how are you? What are you looking at? Cars. I started feeling weird. I don't know if I'm going to be able to do this. I called my wife. My wife works over there. I said, I want to get a picture of this, but I feel weirdly weird by this magazine reg by myself. Would you meet me there? She met me there. I felt a lot safer. In fact, she came in. I was there first. And actually, I did. I walked over. I looked at the magazines. And I thought, boy, I'm glad she's coming. I would feel so weird. So I walked over by the transportation. I looked at cars. I'm looking at cars. looking at this little Beamer magazine, and all of a sudden right behind me this voice comes, I knew you'd be here. I knew you'd be looking at this. Anyway, busted. Anyway, she's getting a support group from me around looking at car magazines. Anyway, we looked him over. We bought four. Mainstream, grocery line checkout stuff. We brought him home. we paid attention like spies viewing the land will view the land. Now, I don't perceive myself. Maybe I am, but again, this is just my own perception. I don't think I'm a prude or blind to what's going on in the world. But what I saw in those magazines made me sick for the lies they tell, made me sad for the people who believe them. And here was the emotion I wasn't quite ready for. It made me frightened and it made me feel small for what we're up against, For everywhere I looked, on every page, what I saw was Bale. And it wasn't Penthouse Magazine. It was mainstream stuff where Bale was so prolifically represented. Without going into great detail, suffice it to say that on just about every cover of every magazine and every page just about inside those covers was this not-too-subtle message that what you need to be happy and hip is three things. What do you think they are? Money, sex, and power. Which actually is no big surprise. There's part of me that, you know, and maybe even as you're hearing this, you're going, what, was that surprised? No, it didn't surprise me. I knew that. You know, when she told me to go look at the magazines, I knew what was in those magazines, but I've never looked at them. I didn't know what was in them. And I wonder if the spies, when the spies originally went out into the land to view the land, you know, when they went in to view the land, I think they knew that there were fortified cities. I think they knew the walls would be big and they would be scary, but it wasn't until they went into the land and really looked and paid attention that they started feeling overwhelmed. I knew what was in those magazines, and so do you. But when I paid attention, it started to overwhelm me, just like I think the spies might have felt. It was interesting to note that the clear message in most of these magazines, again, mainstream stuff, was this. Married or single, teenager or adult, the assumption is that you're going to have sex. So our great service to you, because we care so much about you, is this. Here's how you can have better sex. Here's how you can have more sex, safer sex. Here's how you can have oral sex. Here's how celebrities have sex. Here's how our readers, your peers, have sex. And that would be letters from people who are having sex in various places and in various ways and in various amounts. And by the way, the underlying message of that is this. If you're not having this much this way, you're probably missing out. You're probably missing out. and here's how you can use your sex to get what you want that's another one of the powerful messages here's how you stop right there think about that message be a good spy don't just glance at it pay attention listen to what that's saying here's how you can use your sex to get what you want in other words here's how you can use your sex to get what power money sex power well where'd you hear that message in I'm going to tell you that in a minute. Before I do, let me tell you this. You remember a few weeks ago, we taught in some detail about Baal, what it was, what Baal worship in essence involved, and we indicated that at the core of Baal worship was not necessarily sex. Sex was clearly involved in Baal worship, but sexuality was not at the core. At the core of Baal worship was an insatiable desire to possess. Indeed, the word Baal, you may remember, literally means Lord Possessor. And that which you are driven to possess in the context of Baal worship is three things, interestingly, money, sex, and power. And where sex is in a circular way involved in this mix is this, that sometimes you end up using sex to get power. Sometimes the other way the cyclical thing works is you use your power to get sex, and round and round it goes, that circular interconnectedness between money, sex, and power being, whether you realize it or not, at the very heart of ancient Canaanite Baal worship. Imagine then my surprise when looking over the magazines I saw on the cover of this month's issue of Harper's Bazaar magazine, which is simply a woman's fashion magazine, a picture of Britney Spears provocatively dressed in black leather with two words in bold print across the picture. This is basically, this is everywhere your eyes were brought to these two words across the picture. Guess what the two words were? Sex dash power. You know, I went to the bookstore to find some examples of money, sex, and power. I didn't think it was going to be quite this easy. I thought it was going to be a little more subtle. I was expecting to have to go and kind of read the message behind the message and kind of decode this stuff. But right there on the cover, sex-power. What is the message of that cover? And those two words, presented the way they are. I mean, I almost feel like part of my task as the spy today, as we're viewing the land a little bit again today, as we have in the past, is much like we exegete Scripture. Exegete the exegete for a minute, that magazine cover. What's it saying? What does it mean? And the obvious message in my mind is this, that sex and power is what you want, that Britney Spears has both of those things, making her the ideal woman in a culture that worships Baal. Somebody who has sex and power and money is therefore the ultimate man or the ultimate woman. The kind of woman, by the way, our daughters all want to be. Interesting thing about that magazine, Harper's Bazaar is directed to women, but you put Britney Spears on the cover, who's going to read it? kids. Learning from her, our kids will, if they pay real close attention how to use their sexuality to get what they want. And what do you want? Well, according to the magazine, according to the message on the cover, without reading an article, just the message on the cover, what you want is power. And the power that Britney Spears has seized with her sexuality is money. Are you saying she has sex to get money and power? I don't know if she has sex. The message of the magazine article, you need to hear it, you need to see it, is this. She is using her sexuality to get power. It's not about whether she has sex. It's about using that to get power, money, sex, power, all there on the cover of Harper's Bazaar magazine. Now, in case you're feeling like I'm reading too much into that magazine cover, consider this article in Teen Style Magazine and again if Harper's Bazaar is directed to women although kids we all know are going to look at something with Britney Spears on it Teen Style Magazine is clearly their demographic is going to be adolescent and pre-adolescent particularly girls this is the title of the article that caught my attention among many others this is the one I could use How to Get What You Want that was the title How to Get What You Want underneath that the opening paragraph was this As if you didn't already know it, girls rock. Obviously smarter, quicker, and sexier than our male counterparts. We need to milk our girliness for all it's worth. Teen Styles, that's the name of the magazine, is giving you the top ten ways that you can get everything you want from your boyfriend with some good, clean, well, not always so clean, flirting. Of the top ten suggestions they gave to get what you want from boys, seven were of a sexual nature. Well, okay, so some of you say, well, big surprise. It wasn't have sex with your boyfriend to get what you want. This message directed to 12, 13, 14-year-old girls was use your sex, use your sexuality to get what you want. And literally, they said this. Of the 10 suggestions, there were things like this. Here's how you can touch him to get what you want. Here's where you can touch him to get what you want. Here's how you can tease him to get what you want sexually. Here's how you can dress to entice him in order to get what you want. Here's how, in other words, you can use your sexuality to get power. At no time did it say, have sex with him to get power. Here's the message. Here's how you can use your sexuality to get power. And it doesn't take a genius to figure out we're talking about Baal. But this whole cyclical thing spins out the other way as well. and this is an application we've spoken of at length in the past because of women and little girls are being actively taught how to use their sexuality to get power. Maybe part of the reason behind the energy of actively teaching that is that men have used power in physical and financial and political ways, often using power to get sex, to diminish and control women in life-stealing ways. Need some examples of that? You know what? One of the things that occurred to me when I was preparing this sermon was when it comes to this kind of thing, you know, pastors, you save magazine articles, you save news. I don't need to save magazine articles. I don't need to save because there'll be one in tomorrow, this week, all week long, feature story on the news every night, two students at the University of Minnesota, football players, sexually assaulting a 19-year-old girl. What's that? At the most evil, extended level, as an example of someone using power to force, to take what you want, is this issue of sexual assault, men using power, sometimes physical power, sometimes emotional power, to force. The stereotypical Hollywood scene, it's kind of a yawner now, oh yeah, yeah, right, right, is this, the little starlet girl wanting to become successful needing some of the power wanting to get into the career thing, wanting to get the money sleeps her way to the top. Remember that little phrase? They sleep their way to the top. She's a really bad person. But the reason she has to do that is because the man, the director, the producer this is the old stereotype who has the power, uses the power to get the sex she uses the sex to get the power and round and round we go. And as she uses her sex to get power, once she gets the power. She uses her power just the same way the men use their power. They use it to crush and to win. And it's all about bail. And it's everywhere we look. And by the way, if you think it's only in a Hollywood scene or some evil person who's sexually assaulting someone, you need to understand, and maybe some of you do, it's happening in marriages and it's probably happening in marriages in this room. Where women are using their power, where men are using their power, whether it be physical or emotional or financial or fear tactics or coercion, to get what they want. And somebody else is using sex to get what they want. And as it circles around, what you have is people who have been influenced by this whole issue of veil. And into the teeth of this way of life that we don't even know at times that we're so steeply involved in, we speak verses like this, as I did a few weeks ago. 1 Thessalonians 4.3, I hear the Apostle Paul into the teeth of Baal worship, into the teeth of our culture, into the teeth of the church of Jesus Christ, that this is the will of God concerning you, church, your sanctification. What I mean by that, because I'm not sure you'll know what I mean by that, is that you abstain from sexual immorality. And what I mean by that, says Paul, because I'm not sure you're going to know what I mean by that, is this, that you would learn how to possess your body in sanctification and honor, not in lustful passions like people who don't know God. But as this week I was playing the role of the spy to get back into the flow of the sermon series I'm in, that verse felt like a little, eh. Felt small. And the truth is, it was a very strange experience I had Thursday morning. Wednesday night was the evening. Bonnie and I went out to the magazine place and brought some home and looked them over. Thursday morning I went down into my office. Time to write. right in the middle of my studying all of this stuff, I started feeling really small, really heavy. And while this might sound a little extreme, honestly, the emotion that I could put a word on was I felt scared. I felt afraid. Like Pastor Putz. Honestly, that's what I felt like. Like, you're going to come against all this, Dave? I mean, this is what people read. This is not bizarre, far-out stuff. This is the mainstream stuff that people read. So who do you think you are that you're going to come against any of this with any effect? Do you really believe that anything you say or anything you do has any power to stem the tide? I've got news for you. This is what I was kind of hearing in my spirit, Dave. I've got news for you, and it's news that all the research you just did affirms. Baal is winning, and it's not even close. And in my office, I began to wonder. I wonder if what I'm feeling right now on this Thursday morning for a pretty short period of time, actually, is anything at all like what the spies, the first spies under Moses' leadership, I wonder if I'm feeling what maybe they felt when they went out to view the land for the very first time, who went upon viewing the land, really seeing it this time, ended up saying this, Numbers 13, Here's the truth, Moses. We are like grasshoppers in their sight. They are giants in the land. This land is a land that devours its inhabitants. They are too strong for us. We don't have a chance. Don't even think about having an effect. And so they never moved their feet. They never entered the land. They never made a difference, not even in their own families. And then the word of the Lord came to Joshua. In Joshua chapter 1, saying, Beloved, the word of the Lord came to me Thursday morning because it was in the text, and the word of the Lord now in view of what we're talking about this morning needs to come to us as well. The word that came to Joshua that needed to come to me Thursday morning, it needs to come to us this morning, especially if you're feeling like Pastor Putz, especially if you're feeling like Parent Putz. Parents, do you ever feel like that? In light of what I'm sharing with you, is there anything that's coming over you and going, but what about my kids? What hope do my kids? And you start feeling small, like you have no authority, like you can't speak anything into their lives. Hear the word of the Lord. Teenagers, are you overwhelmed with what you face at school, wherever it is in the circle of friends? Hear the word of the Lord. Joshua chapter one, verse nine. Have I not told you, commanded you, be strong and courageous, men and women of faith. Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you, even when you feel small. So put your feet where God tells you to put your feet and possess the land, says God, to the people of God on the shores of the Jordan River. But before you take the land, before you cross the Jordan, let's go, let's fight, stop and prepare yourselves. Don't worry about the world today. Consecrate yourselves. Wonder what's going on among yourselves. and that's what we're doing in this series so by way of preparation continued preparation and consecration let's continue this morning to talk about sex in particular disordered sex get back to where we were some weeks ago the lies we believe about sex that make our sex disordered lie number one I gave you sex several weeks ago was this that our sexuality involves nothing more than a biological urge or a physical function, a genital expression. The truth we tried to inject into that lie was this, that when our sexuality is expressed in a physical way, something more than physical essence is involved, that our sexuality, when it is engaged in physically, touches our spirit, it involves our soul, our very essence is involved. We said it this way, it's more than a physical expression. It's a spiritual union, which explains, at least in part, why things like adultery are so devastating, premarital sex is so inappropriate, sexual abuse and rape are so horrific because more is involved than skin to skin in our sexuality. Something deeper and much more profound than a body part is being touched when a body part is being touched. Lie number two, where we'll go today, and this won't take long, but it's a big lie, that sex is a biological urge over which I have no control. I think that's a lie. The essence of the lie is found in the second part of the statement, which says, over which I have no control. Let me clarify something about what I mean here. It is true that sex is biological. I mean, I'm not an idiot. I know that. Estrogen, testosterone, hormones are real. They have an effect. Indeed, among us in this room are different levels of sexual desire and drive. It's biological. What isn't true, however, is a lie. This is the lie. It is the belief among some that because it is biological, which is true, but that because it is biological, I don't have a choice. That because it is biological, I can't be expected to have control. I'm not responsible for my behavior. It's not my fault. In fact, it's your fault for being so attractive, quite frankly. God made me this way. I have no control. It's biological. That is a lie. Not that it's biological, that's true, but that because it's biological, I have no control is an absolute lie. It is a lie perpetrated in the media in a variety of ways, in particular to men and boys. And I would talk to men and boys. I've been doing some talking, unusually, to women. I usually, in these sex talks, talk more to men. But I would speak to the men right now about this. Because some of us are told, all of us are told, some of us believe it, some of us don't, That because you're a man, there are some magazines, media context, sex surveys, that tell you that because you're a man, you're biologically wired in such a way that you can't possibly expect to have a life of fidelity. Give yourself a break. It's not your fault. We'll even make it spiritual. God made you this way. You're like deer in the rut, you know? I'm talking to guys. Some of you who know about the deer in the rut. What happens in the rut is when the doe goes in heat, the bucks get stupid. You know, it's biological. It's biological. If you're a hunter, you kind of hope you're going during that time because the bucks normally, wise, smart, picking up scents miles away to avoid getting shot, just fall, get them, it's real easy. Well, that's me. It's not me. It's not you either. It's not you either. That is a lie. Now, as I say that and get real big about that, I just know there are some among us, men and women now, who are sitting there squirming a bit, being polite, you're not leaving. But see, when I say that's a lie, for you, it doesn't feel like a lie. The truth about you is this. Sexuality in your life right now is out of control. You've lost your ability to choose. You've lost your ability to say no. You do feel like a buck dealing with this thing. thing it does feel like a biological urge over which you have no control. If that is how you feel right now, with some sympathy, let me just get around you. I'm not going to yell at you right now, but I want you to consider something. That if your sexuality right now does indeed feel like a biological urge over which you have no control, I want you to consider this, that maybe something other than the biological urge you have for sex, which is real and normal, that something other than that is driving what's out of control about your sexuality. Like what? Well, let's talk about just a few real quickly. One example is one I've used sometimes in the past several years ago in the context, much like this one where I was thinking about this stuff, and it often happens this way, because what I'm aware of is that sometimes when you're paying attention, you hear things, you hear all the time, but you don't really hear them. Well, this was that kind of a thing. I was out for a jog. My headphones were on. I was listening to some music. I heard the lyrics of a song. I'd heard many times before, but this time it caught me. The phrase that caught me was this. The boy became a man that day. Well, I was curious. That's cool. Boys becoming men. That's an important thing, but I'm curious. What has the power to turn a boy into a man? According to the song, a night of sex with the queen of Memphis has the power to turn a boy into a man. Something in me says, lighten up, Dave. It's just a song? I don't expect much of songs. There's a message there, though. It's subtle. When you think about it, it's not subtle at all. But what happens if you start to believe that? Even subconsciously, not knowing you believe it, begin to believe the message that sex has the power to initiate, generate, or validate your identity as a man. Not just about men, your identity as a woman. What if you begin to believe, even subconsciously, that what has the power to generate and validate your masculinity, your femininity, your desirability, your lovability, your acceptability is sexuality. If you begin to believe that, you might begin to feel some pretty strong needs for sex. If sex is what has the power to turn a boy into a man, if sex is what has the power to make me acceptable, lovable, desirable, I might start feeling some pretty strong drives for sex. But consider this possibility that what's driving your strong desires for sexism, biology, or even raging hormones. But core beliefs built on lies. Lies like this. Sex has the power to turn a boy into a man. Now, if you mix that message with raging hormones, if you mix that message up in the pot with normal biology, suddenly sex is way more than a biological urge. It's an identity quest. and now you have to have it and now it's out of control. Hear this. When sex is out of control, it's hardly ever about a biological urge. It's almost always about a hunger of the soul that you're trying to feed with something that will only make you more hungry because as wonderful as sex can be, when rightly ordered, even when it's rightly ordered, it was never designed by God to fill the hole in your heart. speaking of filling the hole in your heart do you remember the video we saw some months ago at the very beginning of this series if you weren't here I'll tell you about it if you were I'd just remind you we showed an excerpt from a PBS documentary featuring an affluent suburb in Atlanta, Georgia where public health officials had detected an outbreak of syphilis in an alarmingly large number of adolescent and pre-adolescent kids. And among the things most telling and sad to me in that video, and there were many, was this. When particularly the girls were asked if they enjoyed sex, was it pleasurable? And you just need to know that the girls they were asking were being sexually active. When asked if they enjoyed it, said no. In fact, what I remembered most about the video in terms of that answer was that in every girl they asked, It was like the first part of the interview was asking them if they were sexually active and at what level. And they were very flippant. And yeah, it was like it was so cool. And as a parent, there was something about me. It was wanting me to grab them and say, do you know what you're doing? It was just, yeah, it's really funny. But then when they asked them about whether they enjoyed it or not, a sadness came on them. That was so obvious. And they said, no, I don't enjoy it. Remember that one girl said, no, sex is for boys. We get used in this whole thing. And it just raises this question, then why are you doing it? What's driving that? Biological urge over which you have no control? No. Biologically, those kids, the boys and the girls, didn't need sex. What they needed, as that video made so abundantly clear, what they desperately needed was connection. What they desperately needed was some semblance of authentic love. And they were willing to do anything to get that love, even if it meant giving themselves away, even if what they were getting wasn't the real deal, even if what they were getting was leaving them even more hungry and more thirsty, at least it gave them a taste. It was like somebody who's dying of thirst, salt water's around, you drink the salt water just because you think you're going to die, but the salt water just makes it worse. I remember a lot of things my dad said, and they come up at poignant moments like this one. You're sitting around and you're wondering, why do people do what they do? Not even about the sexuality thing. Why do people fall for that? You think of some cult and some group of people who are otherwise intelligent people. They fall for this and they all commit suicide or some bizarre thing. Why do people fall for that? Why do they listen to this bizarre message over here? And I'll never forget what my dad said, and it applies to this. He said, you know, when people are starving, Dave, they will eat anything. When people are thirsty, they will drink anything. And rather than responding to that statement as a church by going, yeah, these people, just wonder when I say those words, where are we as a church? As we prepare ourselves and consecrate ourselves, when people taste us, what do they taste? What do they eat? Is the authentic life of God, even around our own sexuality, rightly ordered enough that they would get a taste of the real deal. I'll never forget this example, final one. This is some time ago on the Today Show. Katie Cork is interviewing the daughter of Marlena Dietrich. For the younger people among us, Marlena Dietrich, for a point of reference, was the Madonna of the 30s and 40s. Her daughter wrote a book about her life and shows she was on the Today Show. Among the most fascinating disclosures about this woman that most believed to be a sexually insatiable woman, Marlena Dietrich, was this. According to her daughter, Marlena Dietrich hated sex. Katie Couric was kind of blown away by that. Not that she hated sex, you know, because we've met people who've hated sex. But Marlena Dietrich had it all the time. If she hated sex, why was she having sex? Her daughter said this, and I quote, Because then they would go away, my mother thought, and she didn't want to be alone. Biological urge? I don't think so. More likely a hunger of the soul. But all too often people try to satisfy with something that will only make them more hungry. In John chapter 4, Jesus met a woman at the well and he knew something about her. He knew a number of things about her. one of the things he knew about her was that she was trying to satisfy the hunger in her soul with one sexual relationship after another. And the man she was with right now was not her husband either. He knew that about her. And he read her mail around that and it stunned her. But he also knew something else about that behavior. What he really knew about her was this, that she was thirsty. And that she was desperately trying to quench the thirst of her soul with something that would never be able to do it. And so he offered her something to drink that day. Didn't condemn her. He offered her something to drink. He offered her himself. Saying, in essence, this. I am the water of life. And I alone can quench the thirst of your soul. I alone can satisfy the hunger of your heart. So the final word I have as we close this morning isn't to scold you. if your sexuality is out of control. It isn't even to tell you to straighten up, though you really need to. That's not the word. The final word to you today, if you're struggling with this, is enter in. It's come and drink. Bruce said it earlier as we close the worship and the Spirit and the Bride say, come, and let the one who hears come, and let the one who is thirsty come and drink the water of life because nothing else will quench the thirst in your soul. or satisfy the hunger in your heart. This is an unusual way to close my sermon, what I'm about to do. But in a moment, the altar team will be here for anyone who needs prayer for anything, especially anything that's stirred up by what we've said. One of the things we've talked about in this series is that while these prayer times are powerful and they can be transformational and they can change directions and strongholds can be broken, they aren't magic wands. It doesn't all just get fixed when you come forward for prayer. There needs to be more. And I just want to direct, especially if you have some issues stirred up with these things, to direct your attention to the fourth page of the bulletin today. On the right top side, it says, resources mentioned in today's message. And these are resources that are there for you, that if you want to follow up on some of the things that we're stirring up during these weeks that are there for you to follow up and get the kind of help that you need. They're listed there. I'm not even going to read them. I just want you to be aware of them. Let's close in prayer. Let's stand as we close. Father, first of all, I just pray that you would continue to use this word and this series to make us aware of the ways in which we're surrounded with Baal and maybe we don't even know it and maybe have yielded some authority in our homes and our lives to the messages of Baal and begun to believe things that we really don't believe and really don't value. Just use this to heighten that kind of awareness. I pray especially also for those among us who may be caught in that trap of sexuality being very, very much out of control and using it to feed things that sexuality has no power to feed. And I pray that there would be great hope in this word and great deliverance and the courage among many to come and drink from a different well. I pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
