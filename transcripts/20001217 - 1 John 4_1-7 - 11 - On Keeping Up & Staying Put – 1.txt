1 John chapter 4. Picking our study up in this continuing study through this epistle, 1 John, pick it up in the first verse of chapter 4, beginning with these words. They'll be up on the screen. John says this, Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they're from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. Now, some of the false prophets that John is making reference to here, I've already identified In the course of our study over the last several weeks, we've already met the Gnostics and the Docetists, the Syrenthians, just to name a few. But John indicates here in this verse that there are many false prophets, false teachers, presumably, therefore, more than three, creating, I believe, for these first century believers what I think we can only assume to be a kind of confusion, uncertainty, maybe even fear. fear, with all the voices, with all the divergent opinions, all claiming to kind of have a piece of the truth, their obvious dilemma would be this. Who do we trust? How do we know? I mean, we want to be inclusive. We want to keep our arms really wide to receive people. We don't want to be narrow-minded. We don't want to get so isolated and insulated that we lose our ability to speak into our culture with relevance, but we don't want to compromise the truth just to get along. Jesus has said to us that we need to be in the world, but not of the world. So how do we keep our boat in the water without getting the water in the boat? John responds to that, verse 2, by this you know. End of verse 6, by this you know. In other words, with lots of room to move otherwise. Here are the boundaries you need to stay inside of, church. Here is how you navigate in a culture with so many false voices, with many divergent voices, all of them claiming a piece of truth. Read with me now verses 2 through 7. By this you know the Spirit of God. Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist of which you have heard that it is coming and now it is already in the world. You are from God, little children, and have overcome them because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world. They are from the world. Therefore, they speak as from the world and the world listens to them, implied there, and as they listen to them, they become like them. We are from God. He who knows God listens to us, implied there and we become like God. He was not from God, does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. Well, John, I believe in these verses is providing for his original hearers and for us five boundary markers of authentic Christian faith outside of which we cannot go without losing the heart of the gospel. I see it like a river. I hope you can too. The authentic, born of faith, people of God around the world are the river. This river is living. It's ever moving. It's ever changing. Depending on where it is you happen upon this river, sometimes it's very wide, sometimes it's very narrow. Sometimes the river is very, very deep. Sometimes the river is shallow, frighteningly so, dangerously so. Sometimes, depending on where you see it, depending on the day that you arrive and look at the river, the waters are turbulent and moving quite a lot. Other days it's calm and serene. The river moves this way and that, cutting a path through the countryside, creating and sustaining life wherever it goes. There's life in the water. There's life along the banks as trees and plants grow, drawing on life from the water. This river looks different in different parts of the country and different countries of the world. But always, this river functions within certain boundaries. The river always stays inside its banks. And when it doesn't, because sometimes it doesn't, it's no longer a river. See, a river without boundaries is not a river, it's a lake or a flood or maybe just a puddle. What I believe John is doing here is identifying for us the banks of the river. Church of Jesus Christ. Here's the word. Lots of latitude. Many different ways to see it. Many different ways to say it and to celebrate it. It being the authentic kingdom of God and life of God in Christ. Just don't go outside the boundaries. Just don't spill over the banks of the river becoming something other than a river. And the banks of the river, according to John, are made up of five things. five things you just can't move outside of, spill over, or give away, and still call yourself a river, still consider yourself a participant of authentic Christian life. And the five things are these. Now, these five things I do not believe are exhaustive, but as John delineates them in these verses, I think it's a pretty good start. Number one, you just can't give away the mystery of the incarnation. That Jesus Christ is God in the flesh, that Jesus is the Christ, the anointed one of God, on that hinges everything that we believe. Now, verses 2 and 3 will deal with that. Number two, you can't downplay or ignore the miracle of regeneration. Verse 4 will deal with that. The necessity of transformation. Verse 5 and 6 will deal with that. The stability of revelation. and verse 6 also will deal with that. And the abiding power of love, those five things, verse 7 will deal with the abiding power of love. Those five things are the boundary markers. Now, I'm going to unpack those five things in just a bit, but first I want to set for you a bit more context. I want you to keep in mind that this epistle was written two generations after Pentecost. Tremendous changes were taking place not only in the world and in the culture, but also in the church. And like all change, some of the change was good. I think we can just assume that because all change, not all change, but some change is good. A natural part of life and growth is change indeed. A necessary part, a natural sign of life and growth is change. If something is experiencing no change whatsoever, it is very possibly dead. Therefore, because some change is good, it's incumbent upon the church in every generation and every culture in some sense to keep up. But some of the change in that early century, early church, was not good. The Gnostics, Docetists, the Cyrenthians were not good, threatening the very core of the gospel, making it incumbent upon the church, not just to keep up, but in some senses and in some places to stay put, all of which raises this question. In what areas of life does the church of Jesus Christ need to keep up in order to maintain its relevance in the culture that it exists in as salt and light. And in what areas of life does the church of Jesus Christ need to not keep up, but rather to stay put? Now, the reason I'm raising this question is not only because of the text we're in, but because of the time we're in. Indeed, because of the date this is. This is New Year's Eve. And this is my annual New Year's Eve address. I don't actually have a New Year's annual New Year's Eve, but I do today, so it's my annual New Year's Eve address. I don't know about you, but I really do enjoy all the retrospectives around this time of year, news clips that remind us of major changes and events in the past year. And one of the things I notice about most of the things that happened in the last year, I'm watching them and going, oh, yeah, I forgot about that. And I just forgot about most of the stuff that goes on. and it gives you an interesting perspective. But because it's not just a new year, it's still a new millennium, many of the retrospectives that we're being exposed to in the media are bringing us back further than a year. And normally, New Year's, they show you the last year, but because of this new millennium thing, this real interesting time in our history that all of us recognize, we're going back in a lot of these presentations, 10 years, 20, 50, even 100 years. And among the things that come into focus when we do that is this. we begin to realize that this century, indeed, the last 10 years, I don't have to go back 100, just go back 10 years, we have experienced a stunning amount of change. And it isn't until you stop and look at it that you can even notice it. In fact, there is nothing in all of history that compares to the kinds of changes that you and I, quite frankly, in some sense, have gotten used to and need to stop and take a look at, and even in some sense are kind of victimized by, a pace of life that is at times beyond belief. and all of it raises this question that I'm asking this morning. It's a question that whether we realize it or not, we have to face as a people. We have to face it as a church. I have to face it as a person and as a pastor. In what ways do we need to keep up with these changes? And in what ways do we need to stay put and not keep up to indeed stand firm against things that would, in the metaphor, spill us outside the banks, causing us to be something other than a river. See, I think it could be successfully argued that while in John's day there were many false prophets, today there are many more. I think it was difficult to find your way in the middle of the confusion of John's day, but I believe it's more confusing now. I think it's more difficult now. Just the pace of life we live at. You know, I think of people in biblical times as they dealt with the confusion and the changes in their culture and the Roman Empire and all of those things. I'm sure they were quite difficult. And as they walked down the path, stop right there, they walked. They walked? Where do you walk? They walked places. The speed of life. Quite sure. Makes it more difficult. And some of it's happening so fast that if it were possible, even the elect could be deceived in our culture. See, the struggle is not simply that things are changing as we enter this new millennium. It's that they're changing so very quickly. Watts Whacker. What in the world is that? It's somebody's name, believe it or not. Somebody with a name like that becomes a global consultant and a futurist. I don't know what else they could do. In his book entitled, What Comes After What's Next, Watts Whacker says this. That human beings were not built to process the kind of change we're going through right now. The speed of life is leaving skid marks. Scientific information doubles every 12 years. General information doubles every two years. The first law of computer programming is this, and everybody knows it. Any given program by the time it's running is obsolete. More information is generated in one hour than you and I can take in over the course of one life. A daily edition of the New York Times today now carries more information than the average person of the 17th century was exposed to in an entire lifetime. all of which raises this question. In what ways do we need to keep up? And in what ways do we need to stay put, to stand firm and not move? Leonard Sweet, in a book I highly recommend, entitled Soul Tsunami, that's spelled T-S-U-N-A-M-I, makes it clear that the changes we're facing in our culture are indeed a tsunami. Not just a flood, but a tidal wave. That's what a tsunami is. It is a tidal wave of change. And he's using this metaphor of a tsunami to speak of this kind of change that is literally changing the topography of our land and culture. And his word, as he kind of gets a handle on the changes that have gone on in the last 40, 50 years to the church, is this. church. If we don't learn to swim in this culture, we are going to sink like a stone and lose our voice altogether. Changes in technology, economy, and spirituality in the last several years are stunning. The world I grew up in, says Leonard Sweet, is over. Since the olden days when I was born, the world has changed almost beyond recognition, he says, leaving us dizzy, disconnected and open to requiems for a lost civilization. When I was born, he says, movies were 75 cents. A new Chevy cost 1,200 bucks. A pair of jeans were $3.50. Tuition at Harvard, 525 bucks. I could have gone there. Well, I would have needed more than money to go there. Round of golf at Pebble Beach, two bucks. I called a friend last night who I know golfs at Pebble Beach. Here's how I know. I golf with him sometimes in the summer. In every third hall, he says, yeah, I golfed at Pebble Beach. Anyway, 10 years ago, I round a golf at Pebble Beach, 200 bucks. When I was born, Sweet says, it was a nine to five, five days a week world. Today, it's a 24-7, 365 days a year world. When I was born, my West Virginia grandma cooked on a wood stove. She refused to the day she died to cook on anything else. When grandma said log on, she meant put more wood on the fire. When grandma said download, she meant get the wood off the truck. When I was born, penicillin had just been synthesized. Today, scientists around the world are cloning sheep and cows and pigs. This week, Star Tribune, there was an article talking about, I think it was a goat someplace. It was the last goat, and now that species is extinct. But we have good news for you. We can take that sheep and clone the sheep, take the DNA, and bring back species that have gone extinct. Welcome to Jurassic Park. It's where we live. But beyond all those economic, scientific, and technological changes, we live in what most students of cultural change refer to as a post-Christian era. That's a term that many of you are familiar with. Some of you may not be. It really is quite self-explanatory, actually. Post means past, past. It's no longer a Christian era, and it's not coming back. According to Mike Regelli, in his book, Death of the Church, only two countries in the world have more nonbelievers than the U.S., India and China, making us the third largest mission field in the world. Just stop and let that in. You know, is that true? I don't know. I know this guy said it. I don't know if that's true. If it's true, I mean, I hear something like that, and my mind starts to buzz. Post-Christian, like we used to be Christian anyway, maybe the Church of Jesus Christ, Church of the Open Door, trying to have an impact in this city, maybe we need to understand that a pretty significant portion of our population is a pre-Christian culture. Never heard. The authentic gospel of Christ. I mean, I think that's very interesting. See, with all of our cultural advances, we may have more in common with the first century church and culture than we thought. See, the first century church was a pre-Christian culture. People that they were sharing the authentic, transforming, incarnational, regenerational work of the gospel. People were hearing it for the very first time. We're living in a culture that to a larger degree than many of us realize has yet to hear the authentic gospel, has yet to hear about who we are and who we really serve. I want you to think about that. Regelli in his book further says this about this pre-Christian, post-Christian, era and how things have changed. He said, in the 1950s, people's minds were still naturalized to Christianity. If you breathed air in the 1950s, you knew what a Pharisee was. So in normal social discourse, religion and Christianity was still part of normal dialogue. So you could use kind of spiritual or religious metaphors and people would get it. What somebody, or what it meant to call a city Sodom and Gomorrah, 1950s, people would get it. And today there are still people who would be able to follow that kind of thinking and those kinds of words, but to a larger and larger degree, it's not true anymore. Article in Christianity Today some time ago, it wasn't a major article, just kind of an anecdotal story, told the story of a pastoral team at a church in Columbus, Ohio, who took their pastoral team as kind of an outing to Indianapolis for the March Madness basketball NCAA playoffs. And at the other end of the courts, from where they were sitting, that guy with the orange hair and the handmade John 316 sign who shows up at Super Bowls and all these kinds of things. And I don't know, you know, who is this guy? And where does he get his money to find these courtside seats? That's what I want to know. What kind of job does he have? And then he was holding a sign up under the basket opposite where these people were seated and they noticed it and whatever, except what caught their attention and what got in this Christianity Today article was that seated directly behind this team of pastor people were two very well-dressed couples looking at the sign and wondering what on earth does John 3.16 mean? Reduced to guessing because they didn't have a clue. One thought it must be an ad for a new restaurant in town, but the others dissed that thinking no one would send someone out with orange hair and a hand-drawn sign to advertise anything. What kind of idiot would do that? There's a couple things I'd have to say about that. It's like, well, actually, I mean, this has been good. That guy with the sign doing that for a long time. And I just got to wonder, what does he think? What does he think? I mean, does he think he's witnessing? Does he really think people are going to go, oh, I'm going to look up John 3.16? People don't know what John 3.16 is. The only people who do are people who do. You and me. We're not the unreached group. The truth is, and the confrontation is, that people don't speak that language anymore. And if the church is going to be relevant in the culture, we've got to begin to think that maybe holding up John 3, 16 signs doesn't do a whole lot of good. A little bumper sticker spirituality might not reach that many people. I do. God bless you if you have a bumper sticker. But I go buy bumper stickers and I wonder, do you really think you're winning? Like, that'll win them. I don't get it. Christianity. if the church is going to keep up. It needs to understand. We may not like this, but Christianity is now culturally as well as socially and religiously disestablished. Let me just rattle your cage a little bit more. Christianity, Christian, Christian this Christian. What does that mean? What does Christian mean? Not just to you, but to the culture. I would like you to consider as we wonder as a church how we're going to maintain relevance and authenticity relative to the gospel in this culture, I'd like you to consider that the two largest unreached groups in the United States today are number one, unchurched people that I've already talked about who do not have a clue what John 3.16 means. And what we need to address and wonder about as a church continually is how do we reach those people without dumbing down the message? How do we reach those people? The second largest unreached people group in the United States is not unchurched people but over-churched people who have gone to church and go to church all their life, but they are not redeemed, they have not experienced, they do not understand walking faith relative to incarnation, regeneration, transformation, revelation. They don't have a clue about that. The life of God is not in them. I think we would do well, living in a culture like that, to consider over-churched people as an unreached people group. By the way, you know the most Christianized nation in Africa? Right now and by the latest poll, it's 95% Christian. You know what country that is in Africa? Rwanda. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that Rwanda. The genocide Rwanda. 95%... What does Christian mean? What does it mean to you? I know what it means to me. What does it mean to the culture? It's a cliche. it's a genocide what is it I'll tell you what let's just dig a hole and climb in what do you say past post-Christian and pre-Christian dynamics in our culture one of the things that's emerging right now as well that we need to face and be aware of is anti-Christian Princeton sociologist Robert Wuthnow in his book Tour of the Believers Underground writes about one of the two what he calls dirty little secrets in American higher education the one being its disdain for evangelical Christians few groups he says are as despised a minority Christians in general and evangelicals in particular arouse the greatest passion and prejudice it's our culture it's where we live it's where we need to keep up where he needs to stay put. But here's some good news. At least I think it is a ray of hope. At least according to Leonard Sweet, again in his book, Soul Tsunami, he says this, while postmodern culture is intrinsically hostile to Christian faith, it is extremely open to Jesus the Christ. Interesting. Even its truth claims that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. If I want to give witness, he says, to my faith, And I begin by saying I'm a Christian, chances are the other person leans away from me. But if I begin my witness by saying I am a disciple of Jesus, chances are the other person leans in and wants to hear more. For mission's sake, he says, what if Christians were to renounce Christianity and become disciples of Christ? Huh? What are the ways we need to change? What are the ways we need to keep up? What are the ways we need to change language and redefine terms in order to reach a culture? An unreached people group. Now, okay. All of that is context. With all of that context just floating around, maybe disturbing you, raising some questions, whatever. I hope it did. Come back with me to the text, 1 John 4, where John is saying, in effect, this. Church, in a culture filled with many voices, false voices, conflicting and confusing messages, is mind-numbing change, remember this, that the needs of the human heart are still the same, and that they will still only be met by the God who formed their heart. Therefore, church, hold fast to these things, because these things continue to be, regardless of the culture, the absolute hope of the world, five in all. Don't ever let them go, and don't ever be ashamed for the gospel that we preach that many in this culture have never heard involves these things, the mystery of incarnation, the miracle of regeneration, the reality and possibility of transformation, the stability and centrality of revelation, and the abiding power of love. Now let me unpack those just very quickly a little bit. The mystery of incarnation is revealed for For us in the text, verses 2 and 3, verse 2, By this you know the Spirit of God, every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, is from God, the deity of Christ. That he is God, that he incarnated himself in human flesh, Jesus, who is the anointed one of God. Beloved, the good news about the incarnation that pre-Christian culture needs to hear is this, that God so loved you that he came to you. The word became flesh. The abstract has become concrete. The conceptual has become perceptual. Statements about God have become the story of God, and we want to tell the story of God. Principles about God have now arrived in the person who is God. The testimony of Scripture is this, Hebrews chapter 1, that God, after he had spoken long ago to the prophets, in the fathers, in many portions and in many ways, has in these last days spoken to us most eloquently in his son Jesus, who is the Christ. Let me tell you about Jesus, who is the Christ. He is the radiance of his glory, the exact representation of his nature, and he upholds all things by the word of his power. And that will preach in any culture at any time empowered by the Spirit. The testimony of John is this. We've been hearing it since September in the study of this epistle, and his testimony is not abstract. You know what his testimony is? The things that I have seen, the things that I have heard, the things that I have handled in my hand, declare I unto you concerning the word of life. But there's more. Because the mystery of incarnation has made possible the miracle of regeneration. Verse 4. Beginning of verse 4. You are from God, little children. Chapter 3 said that same thing this way. You are born of God by the seed of God. And greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. Greater is he that's inside of you. See, the gospel that we preach is not about creating religious people. Religious people, I don't want to sound mean here, but religious people are a dime a dozen. And religious people in a post-Christian, pre-Christian culture will have absolutely no positive effect on that culture. They might have an effect. The best effect religious people can have on a pre-Christian, post-Christian culture is that it will just numb people to the authentic message and power of the gospel. It's the best it can ever get. The gospel that we preach is not about creating religious people. It is about creating regenerated people, a born of God people in whom the very life of God resides. Greater is he that is in you, who is in you, the God who makes the universe living inside you. This regenerating work of the Spirit is set into motion, is made available to people by confessing Christ. Back to verse 2. Spirit that confesses Jesus Christ. We sit on that for a second. Confessing Christ means more. than reciting a creed that is correct about Christ. It means more than getting the answer right in confirmation class. To confess Christ is to declare Christ to be not only the Lord, but my Lord. Demons declare him to be the Lord. It's interesting what some people do with texts like this, every spirit that confesses Jesus, and they think a spirit would be a demon, And they kind of jump into a deliverance context here. And if you're ever in a deliverance and you're trying to cast out a demon, and that's a real thing, and those ministries are valid. But if you're ever doing that, and one of the ways you can tell you're dealing with a demon is telling to say Jesus is Lord because they can't say it. Yes, they can. It's real easy. Mark 1, verse 24, Jesus is in Capernaum teaching in the synagogue. A man is possessed by a demon. And it would be as if right in the middle of the service, a demon-possessed person stood up and so disturbed by what was being said, or the presence of Jesus in this case, that the person stands up and starts to shout, saying this, what have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? You come to destroy us. And then the demon shouts out, I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God. He gets the bonus round. He got the answer right. Mark chapter 3 verse 11, wherever the unclean spirits beheld them, they would fall down and cry out, you are the Holy One of God, you are the Anointed One of God. Mark 5 verse 7 says the same thing, the point is this, to confess Christ is not just to get the answer right. The demon's got the answer right, he is the Holy One of God. It is to confess that he is my Lord, he is my King, he is my Redeemer, and he has say over my life. and that confession from the heart has power to turn a heart of stone into a heart of flesh it has power to turn a child of the devil into a child of God all of which makes possible this third boundary marker the reality of transformation see that in verse 5 and 6 they are from the world John says and the world listens to them. Implication, as they listen to them, they become like them, but we are from God. We listen to God. You listen to us. I'll explain the us in a minute, becoming like God. The word listen there is the key, and it's where I got the idea that this really was speaking of transformation because the word listen there carries with it the implication of not just hearing, but hearing to such an extent that it has strong influence affecting change. For example, when a parent in frustration says to a child, you don't listen to me, it doesn't mean you're not hearing the words I'm saying. It couldn't physically be possible that you're not hearing the words I'm saying because you're screaming the words at them. It means my words are having no impact on you. My words are having no influence. They are of no effect to your behavior. See, when verse 6 says they listened to God's words, it means they were being affected by God's words. They were being changed by God's words. They were being transformed by this thing. Beloved, the gospel that we preach, right in the middle of many false voices, confusing and conflicting messages, mind-numbing change is not about creating religious people. We don't need one more religious person who know the creed and follow some religious rules. The gospel that we preach is about the mystery of incarnation. It is about the miracle of regeneration and the reality of transformation. People who by the Holy Spirit of God and their participation with him are becoming different kinds of people. Erwin McManus recently said it this way. The church has tried to be many things to impact their culture. We've tried to be a program church, an inclusive church, contemporary church, a liturgical church, a retro liturgical church. We've tried to be a corporate church, a recovery church, and a seeker-sensitive church. Maybe it's time we try being an authentically spiritual church, experiencing authentic transformation. Well, maybe that'd work. It's the only thing that ever worked. It's the only thing that does work. that's why last week we lined the stage with person after person who came and said in different ways from different contexts from places where they hadn't stumbled badly to places where they had stumbled horribly and blood was all over them in terms of their life and their culpability and they just stood and said Jesus is the sweetest name I know and I believe and I have experienced I've seen it, I've heard it, I've handled it in my hands, incarnation regeneration, transformation Transformation. Strange irony in this word I'm giving you today. I wonder if you've already picked it up. Maybe not been able to put words to it yet. But the irony that is emerging in this talk is this. Maybe the best way to keep up and maintain our relevance in a culture that is rapidly changing is in fact to stay put around critical issues like this. the mystery of the incarnation, the miracle of regeneration, and the reality of transformation. Fourth was the stability and centrality of revelation. See that in verse 6. He who knows God listens to us. The word us is a real small word, but it's significant. I believe the us in most of the commentaries I read agrees with this, agree with this. The us there is a reference to John himself as an apostle, along with all the apostles and prophets of the new and the Old Testament. It's speaking, therefore, this us, listening to us, is speaking to the testimony of Scripture, the entire revelation of God. And paraphrasing that phrase, it would sound like this, he who knows God pays attention to the revelation of God. It's his anchor. It's kind of where he finds his bearings, the Scriptures. Allows me to talk briefly about something I don't get to talk much in this pulpit about. I deal with it in the membership class and have great delight in doing it, but it's one of my favorite, it's one of my central paradigms for ministry. It's a paradigm I had when I came into ministry. It's one I hold to stronger even now and believe I will have at my very last breath. It's a paradigm that is revealed in Paul's mentoring of Timothy. And that's what 1 and 2 Timothy is really all about, Paul mentoring Timothy. The context is that Timothy was young. He was in a ministry of a church of about 3,000. He was in way over his head, many new believers, so there wasn't much leadership. He was very much on his own, and he was trying to minister in a culture just like the ones I've been describing this morning with many false voices, confusing directions, and his obvious question to Paul was this, what do I do, Paul? How do I handle this? How do I navigate the authenticity of the gospel through this incredibly confusing culture? And all of these voices pulling people in separate directions away from the gospel and spilling over the banks. Paul's answer to him was all through the first and second epistle of Timothy, but kind of crystallizes in 2 Timothy 3.14 where he says this, Timothy, church of the open door, David, here's what you do. Remember and continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings. which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. And those scriptures, this centrality of revelation, stability of revelation will give you the anchor you need, the wisdom you need even in a culture that is confusing and changing. Don't ever lose your grip, says John, on the mystery of incarnation, the miracle of regeneration, the reality of transformation, the stability and centrality of revelation, And finally, the irrepressible power of love, beloved, let us love one another. For love is from God. Everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. And that theme of love goes through to the end of the chapter. Why did I include this love thing? I mean, I should save this for the next section, the next week. Here's why I included this as a boundary marker that we just can't spill over and move out of. You see, I believe that in the midst of many voices and a frightening pace of change that we live in, the tendency that many of us might have given those realities, and it's certainly my tendency every once in a while, is to just want to dig a hole and climb in. I mean, I just can't deal with all the voices. I can't untie all the knots. Let's just circle the wagons. Let's just build a bunker and call it a church, develop the spiritual equivalent of a gated community when that is a tendency and the voices continue to call here is the deal it is love it is love that keeps us engaged and not digging holes and building fortresses it is love that pushes us out there to seek and to save those who are lost it is love that keeps us quite frankly asking hard questions continually asking hard questions like this lord in what ways do we need to keep up in what ways do we need to change? What languages do we need to learn? And at the same time, Lord, in what ways do we need to stay put and stand firm and never change? Close it off. Wrap it up. Beloved, we are living in a thrilling time in human history. But it is also a scary time. Many false prophets, many error-filled voices, a tsunami of change. And sometimes I wonder, can we really make a difference? Can we keep up with the change? Can we learn a new language that will make sense to a culture that doesn't even know the meaning of John 3.16? And in the middle of trying to change the language so people understand it, Can we do that and maintain our balance at the same time? I want to tell you, quite frankly and publicly, that at times of fatigue, that I do feel from time to time, I just want to run and hide. Build something safe like a fort. Again, the spiritual equivalent of a gated community. And maybe send out search and rescue missions every once in a while. Just go on and come back quick. But then I begin to wonder, what would happen, beloved, in a culture just like ours, if people who had never heard began to hear, and not just to hear but to see, and began to rub shoulders with a group of people, not religious, but a group of people who really believed in and lived out the mystery of the incarnation, the miracle of regeneration, the reality of transformation, the stability and centrality of revelation, and the abiding power of irrepressible love. Well, I think it would be like a river. And I think that river would cut a path. And I think that river would create and sustain life wherever it went. And I think that river would make a kingdom difference even in a culture just like ours. We've got to stay in the banks. We've got to stay inside these boundaries. What are they? Mystery of incarnation. Don't ever let that go. Miracle of regeneration. That is the gospel that we preach. The possibility of transformation. You can change. The centrality of the book, Revelation. and we bathe it all in love, that people will cut a path. That people will create and sustain life wherever they go, make a kingdom difference, even in a culture like ours. I'd like you to stand as we're dismissed. Father, I thank you that we were born at such a time as this. And you have placed in our hearts and in our hands the revelation of God. And you have laid before us the capacity and the tools to minister this truth, this transforming, regenerating truth to this culture. Show us how. Show us how. Show us how. Give us words. Give us ways to do your kingdom work and cut a path, create and sustain life everywhere we go, and make a kingdom difference. And all God's people said, amen.
