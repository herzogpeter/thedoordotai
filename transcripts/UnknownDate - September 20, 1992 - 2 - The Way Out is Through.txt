Next week, we are going to return to our study in the book of Acts. We're going to pick it up in chapter 15. Today, we are going to finish the things that I began last week. Last week, using Job chapter 19 as our text, you may recall that we found him in a pit of despair, in a place from that pit of despair, where he wrote some, I know this for sure, truth on a rock. He wrote it on a rock. and what it was that he knew for sure was this. I know that in spite of my circumstances, I know that in spite of what I feel right now, I know that my Redeemer lives and he will stand and so will I one day. And I want to write that on a rock, not a piece of paper, not a book. I want to write it on a rock because in 10 minutes, my pain is going to steal that truth and I want a place to look that reminds me of that truth that isn't going to go away, write it on a rock. Now, using that scenario for the basis of my thoughts, I went on to share last week some things that during my time away, which was a pretty long time, I wrote on a rock. There were six things in all, five of them I was able to share last week. The sixth I'm going to deal with entirely, just the one today. Write this on a rock, added to the other five. The way out is through. The text I want to use to illustrate that principle is found in 1 Corinthians 10, verse 13. Open your Bibles to that text. 1 Corinthians 10, verse 13. It's a passage that I think many of us are at least somewhat familiar with. There is a ring about this that many of you have heard before, if not heard it taught. It says this, No temptation has overtaken you, but such as is common to man. And God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, that you may be able to endure it. Let's pray as we begin. Father, I pray once again as we come to this time, for the third time on this weekend, that you would again empower the truth of your word, that beyond any physical word we will hear this morning, there would come the voice of truth that comes from your spirit, that resonates somehow in our heart. Use this word, Father, to build your body, to encourage your people. Do your work among us. In the name of Jesus, I ask that. Amen. Amen. It does not require great gifts of discernment to realize that we here at Church of the Open Door have been through a very difficult year. It's much more involved than a tough summer. I kind of last week talked about my tough summer and our events that went on this last summer. But far beyond that, for almost a year, Church of the Open Door has gone through what I think could be described as a shaking. In a variety of ways, we have been shaken. I began to think about this principle, this reality, and I began to think back this last week on some of the events of this last year, and I was reminded of January 19th. I even went into my notes and pulled out some of the things that I said on that particular Sunday when I publicly said in this pulpit that we had entered into what I called then a season of sobriety. And on that Sunday, I did something that I'd never done before. And it was this. I declared that we as a church were in a fast. Now, those of you who were here may recall that on that Sunday, I did not call us to a fast. I did not say, it is time to begin to fast. What I did was declared that we were already in one. And what I did was notice the fact that it had already happened. went on to explain on that Sunday as I will now that generally the way fasts work is that while some fasts we might choose to do on a particular day or for a particular period of time biblically most fasts are not things that you choose I think I will choose that that is a profitable thing but most fasts are things that come to us whether it be for circumstances in our life that are very upsetting that cause us to be preoccupied unusually with the voice of God and needing to hear direction or it is simply the moving of the spirit within us that says to us folks it's time to to be preoccupied with listening to my voice fasts are things that generally are imposed upon us and rather than a fast being a thing where I kind of clench my teeth and tighten my fists and determine not to eat, if I'm in a real fast, eating is the last thing on my mind because I'm preoccupied with hearing the voice of God and some of the delightful things of life don't hold interest to me during those seasons. I noticed June, January 19th, that we had been in a time like that. In fact, by the way, I've done a lot of teaching on fasting here. I don't know if all of you have heard it. Matthew 19 is a very good passage to illustrate the principle I just gave you. It says this in verse 14, then the disciples of John, that is John the Baptist, came to Jesus saying, why do we and the Pharisees fast? I mean, we pick a day to fast and we do it. It's a discipline in our life, but your disciples don't do that. Why? And Jesus said to them, here's why. The attendance of the bridegroom cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? I mean, why would we do a fast now? Now is the time to party. And we're having a wonderful time because the bridegroom's here. But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast. And they will fast, not because somebody tells them to. They will fast because the bridegroom is gone. They will begin to grieve. They will begin to wonder what in the world is going on and all desire for banqueting, for partying, for food, it will be gone. Nobody's going to have to tell them to fast. It'll come to them. They won't have to go to it. added to that principle of fasting that we already had i remember on january 19th i kind of uncovered another facet of what a biblical fast was really all about i'd never known this before january 19th and that was this that that most biblical fasts were not complete that is a fast in both the old in the new testament sometimes was for a day or two or even an extended period of time absolute abstaining from food. But most fasts, especially those over an extended period of time, were partial fasts where they would refrain from quite literally what was called banqueting. They would just withdraw from the party and all of the fun, good things in life. They just had lost their appetite for that. And during that season, there was sobriety. There was a seriousness seeking the mind of God, listening to His voice. It's time to wait. It's time to listen. when those things came together in my mind back in January it seemed to me that that is indeed where we were a light went on for me I shared it with many of the staff and many of the elders at the time and it seemed to be confirmed that for reasons back in January that we couldn't completely understand couldn't completely understand why that we were in fact in a season of sobriety and it was time to pray and to seek and to listen and to wait and to watch. And it wasn't time to get mopey and defeated. It wasn't about that. It was a serious time, though, and we could just sense it. There was a lack of desire in us to banquet. We would try, and it wouldn't be. Just wait a minute. Back off here. Let's receive the season we are in. A week prior to that declaration, where I publicly kind of announced that we were in this season, a week prior to that, I had announced that we were no longer going to build that building on Brooklyn Park property. And that was a hard thing. It was a hard thing for me. A direction we had been moving for a long period of time on one particular Sunday was stopped. That was a big thing. It shook us a little bit. The week after I made this proclamation, noticing that we were in a season of sobriety, the issue of adultery raised its head in the context of our staff, and that rocked us as well. And as a people, we have since that time been in a process of sorting out and healing and stabilizing and venting and forgiving and confronting, and the people involved are going through that, and we are going through that. But that was a shot. It was spoken of from people close to me as a direct hit. That felt like a direct hit, both to the people involved and to us as a body. Two months after that event took place, an elder stood in this pulpit and announced that I had hit the wall, That I, having been a pastor here for 11 years, preaching on a pretty consistent basis, no longer could do it. He just can't do it anymore. And I was gone for what turned out to be almost five and a half months. And Jeff Van Vondren, at the same time, went through the very same thing. You know, last week when I was introduced, that was really a fun thing. One of the things Dan said that was interesting, you know, Dave's been gone a long time and a lot of new people have come since then. And so a lot of you don't even know who Dave is. And that was a wonderful comfort to me. But you know, that was true. And you know what else is true? If you don't know me, you don't know Jeff. And for 10 years, Jeff Van Vonderen has been a powerful voice for the truth in our church. And he was gone. And people who have been with us for a while are wondering, I think, I wish you were wondering, what is going on? Is this whole thing unraveling? Is it coming apart at the seams? The wheels are falling off. Maybe it's over. Whatever else is going on right now, whatever else was happening then is happening now, that back there was not a time to banquet. We didn't have a heart for it. It wasn't time to party. We didn't feel like a party. It didn't feel like much fun. We were in a fast. We've been in a fast. Not abstaining from life, not abstaining from any fun at all. That'd be gloomy defeat. Sometimes it's felt like that. but an abstaining from the banquet. Now, I want you to know something. I want you to know that I know that even in this season of sobriety, even in this season of the fast that we have been in, that in the middle of all of that, some things fearful, some things not, God has been at work. You know, and I know as well, I want you to know that I know God has sustained us. God has provided for us, and God has built and strengthened us during this time. In fact, one of the things I discerned as the summer was going on, and I was in contact with what the Spirit of God was doing here, and as I came back, just discerned the Spirit of things, I believe I am coming back to a significantly stronger body of people now than what I left back in March. So this is not, as we acknowledge this time of sobriety and fasting, It is not a gloom and doom word at all. But when we are in the middle of those kinds of things, a question at least comes up for me. The question is this. How long is this going to last? When are we going to get out of this thing? How do we get out? what is this way of escape that's spoken of in chapter 10 of 1 Corinthians verse 13? Because if there is a way of escape, if there is a button to push, I'll push it. If there is a thing we're supposed to do, tell me, I'll do it. When's it going to end? How long is it going to go? What is this way of escape? Now, I think we've asked that question corporately. But I think also we've asked that question individually. And the reason for that is because much of the tumult of this past year was not experienced corporately. Much of the tumult of this past year was experienced individually by you. And the pain wasn't in our church, it was in your home. And the pain wasn't being disclosed at the altar here, it was being disclosed at your kitchen table and in your living room. it was your kids and it was your money situation and it was your marriage and it was your job and it was it was times when the memories you've got of things that were done to you would not go away and the memory of things that you have done that you have perpetrated would not go away and you've wondered where in the world is this grace we talk about and this healing we talk about where is that What is the way of escaping? How long am I going to be left with these memories? And there have been bondages that you feel enslaved to, that you've even come to the point, I'm never, ever going to be free from this thing. How long am I going to be enslaved to this problem, addicted to this behavior? that seem beyond healing. They will not mend. It looks like they cannot mend. How long am I going to have to be in this kind of thing? And into that kind of question comes this text. And in this text or from this text, there are at least three things that I think are going to help us deal with that question of how long and when is it going to be over. Three things that help. First of all, we need to do some work about the concept of a temptation. No temptation. We need to do some work on that word in terms of understanding. The second thing we need to do is we need to do some work as to the reality of its commonness. The commonness of temptation. And then we need, once we get that, to embrace it. The third thing we need to do is after we embrace the reality of commonness, there's some truth about endurance that we need to acknowledge, and after we acknowledge it, we need to accept it. Let's work, first of all, on this issue of temptation. No temptation, verse 13, has overtaken you. Stop right there. There's two things I want to do with this issue of temptation. First of all, I want to define the word, because I think we've got some misconceptions of it. The second thing is I want to clarify the word. The word temptation, actually, in this translation, is a poor translation of the literal Greek word perasmos. In fact, in order for us to get away from what is conjured up in our mind when I say temptation, I'm going to start using all through my sermon the word perasmos. So it's a new word, it's part of our vocabulary. Let me explain what I'm talking about. Most of us, when we hear that word temptation, think of some sort of seduction or some sort of enticement to sin. Some temptation that calls me and woos me and pulls me into sin. Applied to this verse, we would then assume that there was a promise in this verse that there will never come a solicitation, there will never come an enticement to sin that is beyond what we're able. I promise you, you will never be tempted or seduced or enticed beyond what you are able. And I hear that verse, and then I think of the times when I was tempted and I did succumb, and I think, well, that verse isn't true because obviously I was tempted and it was greater than I could bear and it was greater than I can bear. The proof of that is that I didn't bear it. So I blame the verse. Well, I think there's many things that we could say about temptation and how to deal with enticements to sin, but that's another sermon, it's another text because this word is something else. Let me give you the word. Perasmas literally has no moral or ethical connotation at all in and of itself. Indeed, the word perasmas, you're in a temptation, perasmas literally means to try, to test, or to prove something. In the case of metal, it means to assay the metal, to try it, to test it, to prove it. Let me say it more clearly. To perasmas something is to call forth from something, something that is there. Perasmas is applied, and with that perasmas, there comes out something that is there. Say it even more clearly than that. A perasmas is calling forth something. It is revealing something that wouldn't be revealed any other way. If it were not for the perasmas applied, This thing that needed to come out would never come out. This thing that needed to be revealed would never be revealed. In the case of metal, let's use that as an example. Intense heat is applied to metal. As this piece of metal falls into the realm of the heat, it loses its shape. That used to be a car. We're ruining this metal. It's being undone. Falls into this pot. Turns into a big pile of mush. Heat gets applied to my life. Used to be Dave. Used to be this good guy. He's being devoured. He's being reduced to a pile of mush. What happens as the parasmas is applied to this metal is some things happen. Some things are called forth. One of the things that are called forth from the metal are the impurities, and the impurities are skimmed off the top. Another thing that is called forth during a parasmas is not just the impurity, but the purity as well. And the purpose of parasmas in metal, in the melting down, is not to ruin the metal. though there are times it looks like we've ruined it. It used to look like a car. It doesn't anymore. It's not the purpose of perasmas. The purpose of perasmas is to make that metal. It's to call out something that wouldn't be called out any other way. Matthew 4, verse 1, says this. Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan. Again, when I see that word tempted, I think of temptation. and I think of an enticement to sin. So what the Spirit of God is doing is He's leading Jesus into the wilderness and giving Satan some way with Him to see if He sins. We're just going to see if we can even get Him to sin. Let's play a game and see if we can kind of poke Him just enough to get Him to sin. The Greek word there is perasmas. And Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, And Satan was given some access to Jesus' mind and body and his spirit in some way. But the purpose was not to see if we could get Jesus to sin. The purpose was to call forth from Jesus some of the characteristics that were there that needed to be evidenced even to him in his humanity. Issues of holiness, purity, righteousness, and dependence on God for his identity and for his purpose. And after that parosmos, verse 11, angels came and ministered to him. And after the angels ministered to him, it says in the next verse, John was taken into custody. He left for Nazareth. And from that moment on, he began to proclaim the gospel, the good news about the kingdom of God, that it is within your reach. And he healed the sick and he raised the dead. His ministry began right after the parosmos. The purpose of the parosmos was not to see if we can get him to sin. The purpose of the perasmas was to call forth things that needed to be called forth for what God was preparing for him in the future. Job went through a perasmas as well. We talked about Job last week. And it was for him a calling forth of things that would not be called forth any other way. So that's the definition. Now let me clarify this issue of perasmas as well. What I want to clarify is this, that these tests or these trials, these parasmases, if you will, come into our life not to try to get it to strip up, but to call forth things, but they are not pass-fail. They are not pass-fail. I want to clarify that. The reason I say that is I think we have a tendency to think that tests in our life, hard times in our life, are tests. And my job in a test is to what? Pass it. In fact, when the heat starts to get applied, I'm pretty convinced. I got this little thing in my head that says, okay, I'm going through a rough time. I'm going through a hard time. It's probably just this. It's probably a good thing. God is doing a good work in me, and I just want to learn everything. So I start to journal. I write all sorts of sweet things to God. God, I just thank you for this hard time. Did you read that? Okay. I've got a good attitude. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is such a good thing, and Lord, I just thank you. It's good, because why? You know what? There's something in me that says if I do well, that means I what? Passed. And if I pass, what will happen? The pain will stop. The pain will stop. The test is over. I passed. By the way, if we think that's what a test is, and we do well, and trust God and keep our spirit good, but the pain keeps coming, we're going to feel abandoned by God. We're going to feel abandoned by God. Why? Because my mind was this. The test was pass or fail. I passed, and he still kept going, he's gone. Now when that happens, we start yelling and screaming, and then we what? Then we failed. Now we're really in trouble, because, oh boy, this is the real me. Let me show you this in Job. Let me show you this in Job, chapter 1, verse 1. We saw him last week described in that verse as being blameless, upright, fearing God, and turning away from evil. But a perasmas came to him. his initial response was not phony it was real from his heart he says this in chapter 1 verse 21 god hears my heart on this naked i came into this world naked i'm going to go out of this world i came in with nothing i went out with nothing right now i got nothing that's okay the lord gives the lord takes away i accept that blessed be the name of the lord shall we accept good from god and not adversity was his whole heart on this and then it says in all of these things job did not sin now if a perasmas is past fail and by the way he said all that after he lost his kids after he lost his fortune after he lost his status if they perasmas is past fail then he's there what past what does that mean the pain is what over great it wasn't over it was not for job and now we hear this same guy in chapter 3 just two chapters later say these words i curse the day i was born verse 8 of chapter 3 he says a really neat thing he says let those who curse curse the day i was born i love that verse what that means is this job is saying you know what here's the deal i want to send out a proclamation i want you to gather everybody you know who curses really well bring them to my house and curse the day I was born. Chapter 10, verse 1, same Job who over here said, naked I came, naked I'll go. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Chapter 10, verse 1, I loathe my life and I will give full vent to my complaint. I don't care who hears me. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. He sounds different. and if a perasmas is designed to be a pass fail situation he what fail and by the way when we go through this phase of a perasmas one of the things we're going to feel is that we fail and sometimes we'll even have some people who will feel the same way around us and say things like Job's friends did say ah this is the real you you know we saw or at least we thought in verse 1 that you were blameless upright fearing God and turning away from evil but when I hear this anger and this pain well I guess that was not even true of you we're set up for all sorts of shame we're set up for all sorts also of missing the real work of God in our lives if we think that these perasmas our paths fail. It's not about failing. It is not about passing. It is about, for Job, it clearly was about going through some things. It was for Job. It is for us about being pushed over the edge of things and having things in that context where we feel beyond our limits, have things pulled out from us, called out from us, that would not come out any other way. And some of what came out of Job was anger and questions that were there before. But they were kind of glossed over by all of his ease and success. And when these things begin to come out in the context of a pirasma, sometimes they come out messy, and sometimes they come out angry, and sometimes they come out scary, and sometimes they come out desperately. But in the hands of God, as he hangs on to us, as we go through these things, they culminate in things like chapter 19, verse 26, when he says, I know that my Redeemer lives. Now, you know what? Back in chapter 1, there were two ways Job never talked. Job never sounded like this back in chapter 1 when he was blameless, upright, fearing God, turning away from him. He never sounded like this, pity me, pity me, oh you, my friends. Never hit the bottom there. You know what else you didn't hear from Job in chapter 1? I know that my Redeemer lives and he will stand and so will I write it on him. He didn't talk like that either back there. God was calling out some things in Job. It wouldn't have been called out any other way. And we could read a few chapters and come up with some negative things about Job that God called out. But I'll tell you something else. What God called out of him was intimacy with God that he had never known eye to eye. and it culminated as I said last week with this before I heard of thee with the hearing of my ear and that was good but now I see you with my eye let me just refer with this in mind to chapter 10 verse 13 1 Corinthians when it says we will not be beyond what we are able think with me about Job there's a promise there we won't be tested we won't be pressed beyond what we're able tell that to job in chapter 19 verse 21 we're not at the i know where i'm my redeemer lives place yet we're at the epitome epitome place you know i can't he's out of luck he's out of strength he's lost his grip what do you mean i thought you said you wouldn't push me beyond that this is clearly beyond what i am able because i am not able here i thought about that a lot over the last several months and i don't have any conclusions i have some questions and some some things i'm poking around i'll just share with you what i'm poking you know it seems to me that maybe what i think i'm able is usually beyond what i think i'm able and that maybe in a parasmas god is going to push me beyond what i think i'm able and when he pushes me over the edge and i lose my grip and I say things like this I've lost control I've I've lost my hope I feel like this promise isn't true anymore because I've gone beyond what I am able I have no hope I cannot cope but it is precisely beyond what we think we are able that deeper and more profound levels of dependence and knowing and empowerment our experience this is not light and fluffy but it is where God exists and lives for me and speaks to me and even says things like this to me and to you in those places where we feel like we've been clearly pushed beyond what we're able because we broke down some way that it is precisely where you think you are not able where you have broken down that you are able even to break down you are able to break down you are able to lose your grip. And even in losing your grip, you will find me. It is there in that place that you find messages from the Spirit, lights that go on. I know my Redeemer lives. I don't know anything else. Subtle messages that are hard to believe when you first hear them, but they go something like this. Even when you've broken down, gone beyond what you think you are able, you can still know me and you can still be used by me even in this broken down even this beyond what you think you were able you can even be used by me in fact you may be used more by me than before what we are able to endure and what we think we are able to endure are two different things and God I believe will consistently push us beyond what we think we are able second thing this issue of perasmas being common to man i think we need to embrace that it's a good thing no perasmas is overtaking you but such as is common to man the word there man is anthropos it means human perasmas is anthropos perasmas is human it's part of it is common to the shared human experience. I'd say it this way. You know what, folks? We are in the same pot together. We all got stuff. We've all got pain. It's all part of life. And I think all of us would embrace that. We would all go, yeah, okay. There's a lot of pain out there. Perasmas is common to man. You don't have to go very far to know that, to embrace that. I mean, I watch the 10 o'clock news. I go, Pain, suffering, death, hurt, it's common to man. Listen to your friends who talk about their marriages, who talk about their jobs, who talk about their kids. There's pain involved in those things. You bet it's common to man. The part I have a problem with is not accepting the fact that perasmas is common to man. I have a problem accepting that perasmas is common to me. See, when my house gets hit by lightning, When my house goes up in smoke, when I don't have a place to live, when my wife is having surgery, I'm thinking, man alive, this is beyond anything anybody's ever experienced before. And the feelings I'm having of where God is in all of this and the wonderings about abandonment and hearing his voice are certainly feelings nobody's ever felt before, and I feel absolutely alone when common to man things come to me. see the fact is this i don't get depressed every day but you know what people get depressed every day and i don't feel abandoned by god or by people every day but you know what people feel abandoned by God, every day. And I don't discover cancer in my body or in the body of someone I know or love. I don't discover AIDS in my body or in the body of people I know or love every day, but people discover cancer and AIDS in their body and in the body of people I love every day. It's common to man. It's part of life. happens every day beloved every single day people lose their way i don't lose my way every day but every single day somebody does every single day people break their vows every single day people fall on their face every single day people lose their grip every single day people experience injustice every single day people perpetrate injustice it's common to man what is the value of embracing that principle well one of the values that is not included in this i want to say right away is this my initial response to the fact that everybody's got pain makes me want to minimize my pain in other words what do you mean you got hit by lightning you lost your house what's so big about that a lot of people have lost their house what do you mean you got cancer crying out loud people get cancer every day don't whine did you hear any of that in there maybe not till now but it could sure could have been applied like that what do you mean your wife is dying okay okay i'll be sorry for you but man alive quit it people die every day okay no i'm i'm sorry that would miss the point entirely let me tell you the point of embracing this issue that our perasmas is are common to man what embracing that does is it breaks our isolation and that is a very important thing to have happen when i understand that the pain i have and the confusion i have about my pain is not just mine it's confusion you've had as well it makes me realize i am not alone and generally when perasmas comes to us, we feel like we are freaks in nature. We feel like these senses I've got of abandonment, these senses I've got of wondering about God, the anger I feel toward God. I mean, how do you do that in a church, especially where we're praising God and I'm angry at God? How do we do these worship songs when we're going, hallelujah, and I'm angry at God right now? I must be the only one. I'm sure I'm the only one. No, it's common to man. No, it's common to man. It breaks the isolation. And that releases ministry. I want you to do something with me. Just this little thing, this little exercise. Think right now with me about your life situation. Some of you already are. You've already got it in your mind. As I'm talking about this stuff, you're thinking about your own stuff. In your life right now, think about this. What are you afraid of? Think about it. In your life right now, what are you overwhelmed by? think about it what are you enslaved to what is that addiction that you have even come to believe you'll never get victory over think about it what are you lost in what are you struggling with what are you wondering about what sin are you continually falling into now without doing this physically in your mind look around how's this this whole place is full of people think about them there's a message the enemy would like to send you and that is this the feelings the circumstances the condition of your life is absolutely unique to you. There is nobody who's ever felt what you feel. And if you buy that, you will isolate. And if you isolate, Satan is going to kill you. He is going to kill you. That's his job. That's his intent. That is his very identity to destroy even you but if I can see this truth that my perasmas and my reaction to my perasmas is common to man one of the things that might help me do is say it out loud and find out that that thought that feeling didn't come from outer space I am not all alone in my pain and not only does it release my isolation but it releases among us a ministry of comfort and the potential of moving out of those dark places into healing and health where we can hear again and see again. I don't have to do much work like this when I'm here because this is home to me. But I go speak other places. I meet people outside of the context of open door just like you. Walk outside these doors. You have family. You have friends, people you work with. when I go places to speak for instance I always feel a little bit tension are they going to like me is this going to work on and on and on one of the things that helps me is this very principle it releases ministry in me I make this assumption it's not because I'm so wonderfully intuitive it's because the bible says this is true any place I speak any group I talk to I make an assumption whatever questions I've got they've got them whatever fears I've had they've had them whatever doubts i've had they've had them it's common to man it releases my heart to share my hearts releases ministry our circumstances may be different but every single one of us stand in need of the same grace the same touch the same source the same life the same god now all of that brings me back to the original question when in these seasons of trial the question that we have is how long? When's it going to end? How do I get out? That leads me to the third thing, the truth we need to acknowledge and somewhere along the line accept, and that is this, that the way out is through. The way out is through. Where do you get that? Well, let's look at the text. No temptation taking you, but such as is common, but God is faithful. God is faithful. To do what? He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able. I already talked about that, but here's what he's also faithful to do to with the temptation provide literally the way of escape stop right there good news good news i want to claim that verse he will provide the way of escape and what i'm looking for at this point in time is an escape hatch i want something that in the middle of my pain is going to come along tap me on the shoulder and go poof poof and little twinkling sounds happen the cloud goes away and here i am all my problems solved my boils are gone my children have been raised to life ha! whoa! I like this verse and I'm telling you when I was in the dark night of things and I've been there and I will be again and when we are there I'm telling you I am desperately looking for the way out and my first response is what I said earlier to try to figure out what I'm supposed to do I'll do it what I'm supposed to say I'll say it what am i doing wrong maybe i should pray a little more pray a little more pray i i prayed all through this thing and that was a powerful thing you know i i get nervous when i talk like that because it's sometimes i think you think not all of you that i'm mocking praying all the time pray all the time pray all and when you pray all the time it doesn't mean it's just going to lift necessarily but pray all the time but it says right there it will he will provide the way of escape well what's the way of escape it says this in the next the end of the verse here's the way of escape the way of escape he will provide the way of escape that you may be able to endure it here's the way it works the god who is faithful to be in the middle of that verse the God who is faithful is going to make you able, who is going to enable, he is going to anoint, he is going to empower you to, last two words, endure it. The way out is that the God who is faithful is going to empower you to go through it. That's the way out. The way out for Job, beloved, was not a magic wand that hit him on the head and made it all go away. ever the way out for Job was what? through and for the things that waited for Job through that pain what a tragedy it would have been had somewhere along the line Job gotten his wish because all through Job he's gone God make it go away now and if you don't but if you do God kept calling stuff out and calling stuff out and pushing him beyond what he felt like he was able. In the end of it all, it resulted in an ability to honestly say, I used to hear you, now I see you. If he'd have stopped short of that, he'd never gotten to that. He'd never gotten to that intimacy. And then his pain would have been for nothing. The way out is through. It's true for us too. I've ministered to people in front. Some of you have ministered to me at different times in my life. And sometimes we pray, and sometimes I feel like it's directed by the Spirit. Let's pray for healing. And I'm talking instantaneous, right now, today, healing. This problem, gone. This disease, gone. And you know what? God does that sometimes. When I, by the way, think now of the process of our entire lives, sometimes when I've ministered to people or even had things happen to me where this problem seems at this moment gone, what really is going on in the divine economy is God has kind of given me a break. It's like, poof, it's gone, and I feel light and fluffy and it's wonderful. And really, there's this freedom and this bondage really is broken. But in like a month, there's something there again. Because I still have more to do. Still have more to do. Because in life, the way out is through. God lifts it from time to time, giving us strength to go through, not to escape. Maybe the best illustration of this is Jesus himself in the Garden of Gethsemane. Anticipating the agony of the cross, he lifted that cup of agony and said to God the Father, let this cup pass. Not my will, but thine be done. Let this cup pass. In other words, I hear Jesus saying, there, God the Father, is there a way out? Without going to the cross, is there a way out? And I think God the Father essentially said this to God the Son, yes, there is a way out. It's through. So drink the cup. And the way out for Jesus was through the agony of the cross. And what a tragedy it would have been for you and me had he not gone through, had he gotten out of. Because one of the reasons I can and you can, in our darkest hours, know that we will go through is because he did go through. He really is our high priest who has passed through the heavenlies, has seated himself at the right hand of the Father. He has passed through the dark waters of death. He is our prince, our savior, our archegos. Remember that teaching? Jesus, our archegos, that Greek word, designating the person on the ship who would tie a rope around himself, jump into the water, swim to the shore, tie the rope on a rock, and because he made it, everybody else could pull themselves along by the rock. Jesus is called our archegos, who dove into the waters of death, swam through those waters that if you or I dove into, we would never come out again alive. He came out again alive, ended up on the shores of eternity, turned around, looked to us, and said this, because I live, because I went through that water of death, you will live also. Grab onto the rope. Because I went through, you can go through. God is faithful. To empower us to go through. God has been, in the life of our church, faithful to empower us to go through. God will be in our future faithful to empower us to go through. but let me come back to the question how long for us in this season i mean january 19th you kind of declared the season of a fast a season of sobriety so is it over well you know what occurs to me about that well first of all i don't know i i don't know the answer to that but what occurs to me about that is that when we as elders and staff discerned that we were in a fast it was something we noticed after we had been in it a while so when are we going to be out of this season of sobriety i don't know but i think the way we're going to know is not because i declare it because i demand it it's going to be i just think we're going to notice it and i think we'll notice it after we've been in it for a while and as i have shared this with staff and shared it with elders the sense we have is that that god is that there is a tremendous anticipation of an outflowing of the spirit and i don't want to declare things before they're here but there is an incredible anticipation of that but that this season is not done for us that there we are still in a season of sobriety it's a weird thing sunday last sunday i was i was rising climbing up these stairs a lot of people asked me how i was doing so i don't even remember who asked me this but but how you doing and i said i'm doing really well and I feel real good to be here, but it's a weird thing in my spirit. It doesn't feel like it's time to banquet yet. Like, hey, I'm back, hey! That's not in me yet. As I've shared it with other people, there's been that same sense. It's good, it's good, it's good. This is not a bad, mopey word. It's a good word. So what's the way out? The way out is through. The way out is through. Hanging on to God, hanging on to each other, understanding these things are common to man we have not been abandoned because our god is faithful who will empower us to go through what we have to go through he has in the past he is in the present he will in the future that is who we serve he is strong for us he is strong for you i want you to stand as we close let the altar ministry to come and take their place in the front prepare yourself for people who would come for ministry or invite people who need ministry to come maybe in context or in the flow of the word there is a there is a gift that you know you need to go through some things there may be some things that you need that aren't connected at all with what I said. We just invite you to come and get the gifts you need. Let me pray and then we'll close. Holy Spirit, I pray in your name that you would come right now. And beyond the time we had in worship, beyond the time we've had in your word, now I pray that you would be released for specific ministry to the hearts and minds and the bodies of people. And Father, you would come with your gifts of healing, of strengthening, of enablement for some to go through some things, others who need to be delivered from things, healed, empowered, filled with your Spirit. Father, some need to be redeemed today and in ways that aren't connected at all with anything specifically I said. You've been talking to their spirit about that all morning long, that you are real and you are someone they need to know. I pray that you would, by your Spirit, draw the people who need prayer. And for the prayer team up here, I just pray your anointing on them. I pray, Father, that you would empower them, give them gifts of discernment, give them gifts of your spirit to minister effectively your grace and life and kingdom power. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Those who would like prayer, you come. The rest of you who are dismissed. Thank you.
