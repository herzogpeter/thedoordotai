And, for example, things like forgiveness, we should make a check. There shouldn't be anyone that we haven't forgiven. And if you have a problem with it, work it out. See, the truth is forgiveness is a grace. Most of the things that we have been hurt with, we can't forgive on our own. So now what is the kingdom answer to that problem? Do it anyway, and you will find you can. Do it anyway, and you'll find you can. When you step into it, then you're able. Jesus spells that out in John 14. He says, obey my commandments and I will give you another strengthener. Now that order is important because we might say, well, you know, give me the strengthener first and then I'll obey, but that's not the way it works. You assume and presume upon the presence of the kingdom and put yourself on a course of action which you may well know that you can't do. To forgive someone means that you have released them to God. In the words of Hamlet's father's ghost, leave her to heaven. Forgiveness means that you step into the kingdom. That's why Jesus relates forgiveness to prayer. Because if you're not on forgiveness ground, in the nature of the case, you won't be on prayer ground. because they're both kingdom activities. So when you stand praying, forgive. You remember Mark 11. When you stand praying, forgive. He'd made this great promise about prayer, but he says, when you stand praying, forgive. So see, obedience, another issue is fear. If you have a fear of something, don't live with that. Deal with it. Take it to God. whatever it is you're afraid of. Fear is anticipation of evil. Take it to God. Ask Him to help you work through that so that you will no longer be afraid. You know, probably the most frequent or common phrase in the Bible is, fear not. Fear not. And so that's a gift to us. We don't have to fear anything. And that will involve training and understanding in the ways that we talked about it yesterday and the various dimensions. So the second thing is check your obedience. Check your gospel. Check your obedience. Deal with the issues of obedience. Remember that that is not a legalistic thing. I'll say once again that if you want to keep Jesus' commandments, you don't try to keep his commandments. You try to become the kind of person who will keep his commandments. The first way leads you to legalism, and it's hopeless. You cannot just keep his commandments or keep the law, if that's your aim, but you can become the kind of person who will do that. And that covers all of the things that he talks about. And as we become that kind of person through the transformation of our thoughts and feelings, the set of our will, our character becomes different. What we're ready to do without thinking becomes different. As that transformation, then we find that we actually can do these things. And then we look back and say, "Well, that was a wonderful gift, wasn't it?" Yes, but if you hadn't done something, you wouldn't have it. And so that's the third thing I mentioned to you, check your disciplines. What are you practicing? What are you planning in order to become the kind of person who does what Jesus said and did often without thinking. And you don't have to think about it. See, what we have to stop and think about is a good indicator of where we are. Remember, Jesus really got on a bunch of people's case once because he was in the synagogue and a man was there with a withered hand and he asked the group, is it a good thing to heal on the Sabbath? And they had to think about it. They had to think about it. It's what you have to stop you to think about. That shows, that's a good indicator of where you are now. Sometimes you're in that position, and the point is, look, don't beat yourself up about it or feel guilty about it. Just say, how can I become different? there's nothing wrong with thinking about things but I know for example I know Christians who seriously consider the question of whether or not they should cheat on their taxes or they should report the price they paid for a car differently in California you're taxed more if the car is more expensive and you know those are things you shouldn't be thinking about If you are thinking about them, well, work on that and grow to the point where you don't have to stop and think about things like that. So you do that by looking at your disciplines. And now I have time to say this about it, I guess, that you can't just think in terms of regular church activities. that's not enough and you say how do you know that well you just look at the way things go and you find people who are faithful in regular church activities and that's all and they more or less stay in the same place and more or less don't grow in any appreciable way even though they may be faithful members of the church now we should be faithful to our church don't misunderstand me about that we should be but I'm saying if that's all we do then we will not progress to in obedience to the point where we're living in the greatness of God so we have to plan differently and the kinds of things that we've talked a little bit about are the kinds of things that we plan on we put up a triangle yesterday if you remember and put down in this corner here, planned disciplines. And as we come to the end here, I just want to ask you, what's your plan? What's your plan? I've tried to suggest or involve you in a little memorization project here in these few days we've had together. I hope you have been able to work with it a bit, and I hope you've not been discouraged. Just keep working with it. Reflect on the power of that simple discipline. And you see, the effects of all discipline are indirect. This is one of the things that's so important to understand about disciplines. They're not behavior modification. They have the effect of behavior modification, but that's not their aim. they change you inside so for example if you memorize Colossians 3 1 through 17 you're going to find that it affects your thoughts, your feelings what your body is ready to do it'll affect all of that and it'll affect it in a good way and it's the power of indirection you see that works in the area of grace and keeps you out of legalism and you don't then sort of check your behavior, you're always weighing yourself on the spiritual scale. You're focusing on these practices that are indirectly moving you along the path of spiritual transformation. And you may find, for example, I'll tell you one, I'll tell you, I'll put this out and and you test it. Memorize that passage or other passages, but memorize that passage, let's say, and see how it affects your irritability. I will guarantee you, your irritability will drop. The capacity of things to bug you will diminish. And it won't be because you've said, you know, this verse says such and such, and so I ought not to be irritated. No, you just won't be as irritable. You just won't be there. You won't be as discouraged with things. now you check me out okay because someone like me comes in you get as old as I am you can talk forever now you check this out now see that's what we want you to do please is put it in right down here so you memorize and see what it does for your disposition let it work on you let it work on you same way with solitude and silence, same way with fasting, same way with service. Now, all of them, you have to go through a learning process. A person who's never fasted, they start fasting, all they can think about is they're not eating. So, you have to go through that. And you find, and you will come to a place where, if you practice this, the Lord will help you, you'll come to a place where you say, "So what?" And things like, "You will find you don't get hungry." When you've learned to fast, you don't get hungry. And you can verify this, talk to many people who do it. I remember, you know, Bill Bright, some years before he died discovered fasting. Praise the Lord. And he's actually helped a lot of other people who would never have talked about it if he hadn't started, like Jim Dobson and others who are pretty… well, I don't want to say anything too bad here, but I mean they're pretty… they tend to think in terms of right doctrine and right practice and so on. They don't think in terms of spiritual disciplines. But they've learned. And Bill Bright used to say that when he would go on his long fast, he never experienced hunger. And I'm sure that's right, because I know that for myself. Now, if I fast for a medical procedure, I will experience hunger. And when I started learning to fast, I was thinking about fasting. See, that's where you, as you go along, your mind shifts. The person who, when they start to pray, is thinking about praying, is in the wrong place. You have to get to where you pray without thinking about praying. You fast without thinking about fasting. You are simple and frugal without thinking about being simple and frugal. Those are disciplines that have tremendous indirect effects. And when we begin to practice them, we find that our dispositions change. Worship, study, celebration, service, submission, fellowship, all of those are disciplines. See, if we can learn to come and involve ourselves in church as a part of the practices that change us, we will begin to benefit from coming to church in a way we've never benefited from it before. It's really quite an interesting thing to listen to people talk about why they come to church. but coming to church is a vital practice for your spiritual life why? well because in doing that you worship you share you pray you study you learn those are basic disciplines now this is maybe shocking and possibly even wrong to say it but there's no commandment to come to church as we know it there's a statement about gathering together that's fellowship so we need to rethink church and put it in the right perspective so that it will begin to have the right kind of an effect, which would be that people progressively grow. And we don't have to keep teaching them the same thing over and over because now they've learned some things and they're no longer dealing with that or having a problem with this. And so then we go on to the next level. And our churches probably would wind up having different kind of services to meet the needs of people who are different positions. And that would be a great benefit, actually, because that would mean that people were able to move on in a regular way. So, for example, if we look at the Sermon on the Mountain, we think about things like anger and contempt and lusting and using language to abuse and manipulate others and payback and revenge and all those things that Jesus talks about there. See, our teaching should take us through those so that we learn and grow and we no longer are bothered by a lot of that. We should, all of us here, we should be moving into the place, for example, where if people criticize us, it does not wound us. Now, if you move into that place, then your fellowship will be at a different level. And issues like being open and being able to be intimate without harming people, and those, see, those would change and move on. And that would give us a great boost in practicing the kingdom walk. Now, I want to just say a quick thing or two about applying that same checklist vision obedience and discipline to the church and not the individual. Because I know that we're concerned about that. And so let me just consider a moment with you the Great Commission. And if you want to look at that in Matthew 28, just think about what it says. Now, here's what it says. And I'm suggesting to you that this is the kind of thing we would look at it and we'd make a checklist if we're going to walk in the kingdom now in terms of the church. So here's what it says. After saying, I've been given all power, it says, as you go, make disciples. As you go, make disciples. First question, is that what we're doing? Is that the explicit aim of our church? I know many of you are from other churches and so on, but whatever your church is. And you need to ask there the question also, if that's not the aim, what is our aim, by the way? And here you have to watch flowery language. You know, institutions use flowery language. USC, if you read its catalog, up towards the front somewhere, there's a lot of flowery language about what we do. If you take that flowery language and go around the campus and ask people, do you do that? You might not find anyone who does that. So now, beyond the flowery language, one of the great things about that wording of the Great Commission is it's not flowery. It just says, as you go, make disciples. Now, we've talked about what a disciple is, so we know now what a disciple is. We know that if we're going to make disciples, we have to be disciples, so we have to go through that carefully. A disciple is someone who is learning how to lead their life as Jesus would lead their life in the kingdom of God, as he would, as Jesus would lead their life in the kingdom of God, as he would. that puts the emphasis on our life now and we've moved out to the fullness of the gospel for the fullness of life. So are we making disciples? That's the most serious question for the church to face today. We have developed a religious culture where you don't have to be a disciple. You can be a Christian all of your life and never become a disciple. So now to deal with that will be a challenging thing. And it has to be something that an established church, if they haven't already started out on that basis, they have to work through it with love and care. They have to allow people to shift and redo their understanding. Because many people did not come into Christianity and the church to be disciples. That wasn't even presented to them. Maybe they were told that, do you have a need tonight? Well, some people come in on that basis. And I think some people at least make it in, if you wish, on that basis because they really do establish a personal working relationship with Christ. but they didn't understand the discipleship part. So, they may think this is bait-and-switch time. You say, well, you said I was going to go to heaven when I died, and now you want me to be a disciple. Or you said you wanted to line me up with social change, and now you want me to be a disciple, or so on. So, that's where the importance of that gospel, make disciples. Are we doing that? Secondly, make sure that the environment is Trinitarian. That's what it means to say, "Baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." Do we do that in our...is the atmosphere in our church Trinitarian? Are we counting on the presence of the Trinity to accomplish the goals of discipleship and all the other things that we do, worship and so on. Is that a Trinitarian activity? Is the Trinity the prime mover in what we do? And we remember that it is Christ who builds his church. We don't build his church. Christ builds his church. There's a real sense in which no one but Christ sees the church. And we really have to be careful about who's in and who's out. And I know that's important for various things. We want to remember that Christ may have a different view of it. And so we need to count on that. That's the second stage in the Great Commission. Make disciples as you go. Now then, you get disciples, make sure that they are in a Trinitarian presence. Jesus said, where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am in the midst. You see, that's the nature of the kingdom. But we want to count on it. And when we count on it, we begin to see Him move in ways that we don't if we're just running the show ourselves, even no matter how good our intentions are. If that presence isn't there, moving, directing, energizing, then we will not see the kind of growth in Christlikeness that we would expect to see. Now, you see, if you don't have, if you haven't made disciples in the first place and you don't have the Trinitarian presence, then our congregations are just kind of left to flounder around on their own. And that's why there's so much wounding and hurt and disappointment in them. And then the third part, again, are we teaching people to do the things that Jesus said? This is very simple, very explicit. Do we just say that? Yes, we teach people to do the things that Jesus said. Now, it's almost impossible to say too often. Remember, we don't mean become legalist about it. Because to teach them to do what he said means to transform them by the grace and help of God, to transform them in such a way that they do the things that Jesus said. So, is that our objective? And we need to be very specific. We talked about blessing those who curse. Can we have courses on that? Would we know what to do with that? Have we thought out the pedagogy? Well, we can do that. We can do that. And all of the intelligence and goodness and strength of our people will begin to blossom when we start seriously teaching people how to do the things that Jesus said. That's the Great Commission. Make disciples as you go. Submerge them in Trinitarian reality. Baptize them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Remember, names are not just names in the Bible. So, it isn't just a matter of repeating the names. That means to immerse them in the reality of the Trinity. You can get them wet too. That's a good thing. And then you teach them to do everything that Jesus commanded. Now, in your heart of hearts, last challenge, do you think that's possible? See, and you don't need to respond overtly. You can if you wish, but do you think that's possible? If you have heard the gospel that we've been talking about, you have a basis for coming to a hearty confidence that this is not only possible, it's available to everyone. God has His intentions there, and He will lead us into it. And if that happened, you would see groups and individuals moving into that kind of light where, as Paul says, they shine as lights in a darkened world. You don't have to have a budget for it. you don't have to have a training program that requires you to go to school for it. You can do it. Individually or in your churches, you can do this. Because that's what God has in mind for you and He's made all the provisions. And when you've done that, then you look at the Scriptures, the New Testament, and you say, oh, well, all of that's true. Oh, it's true. It's accessible to anyone. So you don't have to have a budget. You don't have to build another building. You just have to start where you are and say, this is what we do. And in your individual life, you say, this is what I do. Now, I must stop. I'm out of time. I did want to respond to a couple of questions here that were handed in, but I'm hoping that I've left you at a very concrete level where now you will be able to just step on with the things that Todd and I have been talking about here and also test them against the Scripture, because if it's not Scripture, forget it. There's one question here that is asked that is really, I think, in need of a response. Turn the other cheek, love your enemies, bless those who persecute you, go the extra mile, and so on. Is there a balance between this teaching and my inclination to defend myself, protect myself from evil, run from evil, or stop and even to the degree of kill someone in self-defense who will kill me or at least appears to have this intention because he's armed and dangerous. There is a balance. It depends on how you do it. Defend yourself, yes, but don't be your defender on your own. There are things that you should do to defend yourself. I recommend in most places you lock your doors. I've had a friend once who said, no, that's not trusting God. Well, that gets back to this issue of passivity and activity. See, what you do is you do the things that make sense, but you trust God. It's like healing. That doesn't mean you don't go to a doctor. It does mean you don't trust the doctors as the ultimate source of health. You regard them as under-workers with God. And you see, there are all sorts of tricky things here that go into the same way about defending ourselves. You should do what is sensible to protect yourself from evil. If that means harming someone who is trying to kill you, then you should probably do that. I don't think there's a perfectly general answer to the question, but when Jesus is talking about not resisting evil, He doesn't mean do nothing. He's teaching about the tendency to overdo it. You strike me, I strike you back. That's automatic. Well, that isn't automatic when you're living in the kingdom. It isn't even automatic that you would kill someone in self-defense living in the kingdom. That isn't automatic. You have to be careful about the situation and how you're doing it. You want to trust God, but you still have to act. And as I said the other day, I think, If you're going to turn the cheek, the other cheek, make sure it's your cheek and not someone else's cheek. So what does dying, what was letting someone kill you, what does that mean to others? Is it an act of love just to let someone kill you? And the answer is not necessarily. Because you also have others that you love and you have to consider what that means to them. Now, often in the case, you don't have time to think about that. I understand that. But God is merciful, and he helps us beyond anything that we can do on our own. So I don't think there is an automatic answer to that. In general terms, you have to say, rather, that you should do what is sensible to protect you and those you love, but you should always trust God in what you do and not yourself. Now, see, the trick there again is, does that mean you just do nothing? And the answer is no. That's to take the route of saying you're just passive. You still have to act. And the question is how you act, and that's settled by your spirit as you've lived in the kingdom of God. One more thing here, and we must quit then. is talking about the question that came up yesterday regarding the cop who shot and killed a man in the line of duty. And what this person is asking is, my question is, did he likely go to hell if he wasn't a believer in Jesus or if he had never received the work of Jesus accomplished for him when Jesus hung on the cross of Calvary, took his sins and punishment for his sins, himself, said it was finished. He died, went to the lower parts, and it goes on and cites most of the Apostles' Creed. In other words, if a person doesn't have the knowledge of that particular language and these events, are they doomed? Well, Todd addressed a bit of that earlier. Let me just say this, that no one is going to be in harmony and at home with God who does not come there by their relationship to Jesus. Now, Jesus is greater than the historic Christ. As John says, this is the light that lights every man that comes into the world. So now how that's worked out, I don't know. I'm not in charge of it. And I'm not going to tell anyone who wants to know how to be right with God. I would say, well, you know, Jesus is the light that lights everyone that comes to the earth, so just kind of do what you think best. No, I will tell them there's one name given under heaven among men whereby we must be saved. If they think they've got another route, I would say if that's true, it will be because Jesus meets them in another way. I want to give you just a couple of verses here from Romans 2 in response to that question and ask you to think about it, because this is actually a response to that question, except it's being asked about Jews and non-Jews instead of about Christians and, in a certain sense, non-Christians. And here's what Paul says. He's talking about God and His kindness and forbearance. And he says in verse 6 of Romans 2, who will render to every man according to his deeds. To those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. Now, that's what Paul said. To those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness. He will give wrath and indignation. Doesn't look too good there. There will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil. Of the Jew first. Now remember, this is talking about Jews and non-Jews. Of the Jew first and also to the Greek, but glory and honor and peace to every man who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. Is that self-righteous work salvation? I don't think so. I think that's just saying that in God's mercy, He has the facilities and the will to reach out to people of a certain kind, no matter who and where they are. But see, that doesn't affect what I would preach to anyone is the gospel because that is not the gospel. That isn't the gospel. That's a statement about God's provision for people. The gospel is, put your confidence in Jesus. Let him bring you into life from above in the kingdom of God, and then live in that life from here to eternity. Well, let's have a prayer, and that'll conclude. Now, Lord, we've said so much. Todd and I have just done our best to bring clarity about the practical path of walking in the kingdom of God with Jesus. And now we want to acknowledge that you are the teacher, And we want to ask that for every individual who is here today or has been here for the past meetings, that you would give the teaching and the direction that would make them at home in your kingdom where they are and who they are and give them great hope for everything around them and every situation they're in. So take these words. Please, Lord, we hope they were your words. We trust that they were. As far as we know they were, please take them and let Todd and I be forgotten and bring them home to the hearts of every dear person here so that the statement, joy unspeakable and full of glory would be a description of each of our lives that will honor the name of Jesus, that will bless his name and cause others to bless his name and to come to know you through him. And so we ask it in his honor. Amen. Thank you.
