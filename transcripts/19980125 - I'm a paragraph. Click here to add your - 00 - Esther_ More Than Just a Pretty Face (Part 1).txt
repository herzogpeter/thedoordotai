We are beginning today a mini-series on the life of an extraordinary young woman who demonstrated living faith and deep character at a time in her life when the chips were down and the cost to her personally was very high. Her name is Esther. Her story is found in the Old Testament, the book of Esther. I'd like you to turn to it with me now. Esther is found right after Nehemiah. It's just before Job. You find Psalms, everybody can do that. Right in the middle of your Bible, start going left. And you'll get to Esther. It's a small book, and so you might skip over it. It's right next to Job, between Nehemiah and Job. In a culture where the unwritten but very clear message to women was, who you are is how you look, Esther had to answer this question. Who am I? Am I a beauty queen? Indeed, she became the queen because of her beauty, and so in a very real way, a beauty queen. Is that who I am? Am I a pretty face? Am I a trophy wife? Or am I the servant of the living God, Part of a community of faith that is bigger than me, for which I would risk it all in order to do what is right. I've entitled this series, just a couple weeks, maybe three, Esther, More Than Just a Pretty Face. A recent article in Time Magazine about women who they implied were the most envied group of women in our day, supermodels, said this. Today's pretty women represent a new breed Mannequins with sex appeal What makes them successful, famous And worth $25,000 a day I'd do it for half that I would The reason is that they define How a woman is supposed to be Large eyes, long legs, a straight but not too prominent nose Models today are taller and fitter than those of previous generations with fuller lips and bigger breasts. Then summarized, did the article with this phrase, Who they are is how they look. We live in a world that is obsessed with outward appearance. So did Esther. With how things look, image is everything. So says Andre Agassi. Who you are is how you look, prompting some people to go to some rather extraordinary lengths, sometimes very painful, expensive lengths, to get what they consider to be just the right look. I listened with some amusement when at our staff meeting this last Wednesday. I was told of a woman that many of you maybe have heard of. I found out later that she's been on TV and all the talk shows and that kind of thing. A woman in Britain who has gone to great surgical lengths to make herself look exactly like, ready, Barbie. And while I don't see what that would be so good about, and surgical lengths and the pain involved in that, evidently she's had everything done that can be done. It paid off for her because that look netted for her, a very wealthy husband, and through that she has made herself her way into the elite of the British society. And maybe that doesn't surprise you. This morning I was given a book by Jeff Casals in our church. He was here last night and heard the sermon, and he gave me this book that he's been reading, reviving Ophelia, saving the selves of adolescent girls. The author says this, Beauty is the defining characteristic for American women. It's the necessary and often sufficient condition for social success. It is important for women of all ages, but the pressure to be beautiful is most intense in early adolescence. Girls worry about their clothes, makeup, skin, and hair, but most of all they worry about their weight. Peers place an enormous value on thinness. This emphasis on appearance was present when I was a girl, the author says. Our high school had a gauntlet that we girls walked through every single morning. It consisted of all the boys lined up by their cars along the sidewalk that led into the front doors. We walked past them to catcalls and remarks about our breasts and legs. I read a week ago Tuesday with no small degree of sadness an article when 18-year-old Maria Hornbacher passed out and fell down the escalator stairs at 52 pounds. Doctors gave her only a week to live. Five years later, Hornbacher doesn't mince words about the illness she still contends with. In fact, she has written a book about her 14-year struggle with eating disorders called Wasted, a memoir of anorexia and bulimia. In the book, she recounts how she became a full-fledged bulimic at age 9, throwing up every day for years. Hornbacher, the article says, is one of a staggering 7 million girls and women in the United States alone who have similar eating disorders. While there's no pinpointable cause, Hornbacher says, among the pressures is the bombardment with cultural icons of emaciated female bodies. Interesting, she says, that anorexia has no known history and rarely occurs in places like modern Africa where plumpness, not thinness, is admired, end quote. Why is that? Here's why that is. Because who you are is how you look. That's just the rule. The book of Esther is a story of a young woman who had, interestingly, just the right look. She was chosen, indeed, because of the right look she had, to be a beauty queen. But even as that was happening and she was ascending to this position of prominence because of her looks, God was calling her all the while to something greater. The story is set in the capital of Persia, the city of Susa, and it concerns something far beyond Esther herself, though she is the headliner. The story seems to be about her. Something far more significant is at stake. the people of God living in exile there is what this story is really about in 470 BC. The curtain goes up on our drama in chapter 1, verse 1, in the middle of a party. Now it took place in the days of Ahasuerus, Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces. In those days, his king Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne, which was in Susa, the capital. In the third year of his reign, he gave a banquet for all the princes and attendants, the army officers of Persia and Media, the nobles and the princes of his provinces being in his presence. And he displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his great majesty for many days, 180 days. And when those days were completed, the king gave another banquet lasting seven days for all the people who were present in Susa, the capital, from the greatest to the least, in the court of the garden of the king's palace. There were hangings of fine white and violet linen held by cords of fine purple linen on silver rings and marble columns and couches of gold and silver on mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother of pearl, and precious stones. Drinks were served in golden vessels of various kinds, and the royal wine was plentiful according to the king's bounty. And the drinking was done according to the law. There was no compulsion, for so the king had given orders to each official of his household that he should do according to the desires of each person. Queen Vashti also gave a party, a banquet, for the women in the palace. They were two separate parties going on at the same time, which belonged to King Ahasuerus. Let's stop right there and get the picture. King Ahasuerus, also known as King Xerxes, was a man of immense power and wealth. His kingdom extended from Asia Minor down to Africa across to parts of northern India. And because of that, he was a man who had grown accustomed to getting whatever it was he wanted. He was accustomed to getting his way. People did not say no to him without negative consequences. With all his power, however, he had a problem. His problem was this. He had very little inner strength and very little depth of character. He had an insatiable need to show off his greatness. He was very concerned with how he appeared, with what people thought, and what was most important that people think of him was this. It was most important that they think of him as powerful and in control. And anything that would threaten that would threaten his very identity, his very life. The first place we meet him is in this banquet, this party. There are three parties. We've already seen them in the first nine verses. In fact, you can kind of break up the whole book of Esther down into all the different banquets and parties that go on. The first lasted 180 days, six months, verses 3 and 4. The second lasted seven days, and that one included the whole city, so that even the common people would be overwhelmed with his greatness and wealth. Just to give some perspective, verse 7 tells us that the goblets, the golden vessels, were not only made of gold, but every one of them were different. They were unique, showing off not only his incredible wealth, but his creative and artistic taste. Drinking was central to the festivities in verse 9, done according to the law without compulsion, but you could have whatever you wanted, which meant it was a very 90s thing, actually. If you didn't want to drink, that was kind of cool, and you could probably talk about your AA experience, and everybody would respect you, but if you wanted to get loaded, your cup would never be empty. All of this, by the way, this six-month party plus seven days at the end, was all designed to stimulate in the hearts of everybody who attended an exhilarating reverence and respect and adoration for the king. And if it was in a contemporary context, it would all be designed to get people to walk by Ahasuerus and say, Ahasuerus, you the man. And Ahasuerus would basically say, you're right. He would not give the obligatory, no, you the man. He would say, you're right, I am the man. In fact, the only reason I had this party was that so you and everybody in this entire province would know that I am the man. That's why he had the party. Third party, verse 9. Given by Queen Vashti for the women. There's some speculation that this party was simply the female equivalent of the male party. So all the same stuff was going on. Others speculate that it was, by contrast, quite restrained. And in fact, there is some evidence of that, just even in how much it gets covered. There's just this tiny mention. We don't really know what's going on. I would argue that by contrast, it was restraint. He and crumpets probably watched the chick flick, something like that. Daddy did something like that. Probably not. On the seventh day, verse 7, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, He did something you do when your heart is merry with wine. He did something very, very stupid. But it also was something that with his guard down revealed his real heart. He sent for his wife. In and of itself, that's not a bad thing. We can't nail him for that. Except the reason that he had for sending for his wife is very obvious. You see, having spent not only six months and seven, not only this day, but six months and seven days, showing off his power, his wealth, and his possessions, what he's wanting to do now by calling Vashti was to put now on display his wife. That's quite possibly what he considered to be his most prized possession. Emphasis there on the word possession. Something that I'm sure Ahasuerus thought made his wife Vashti feel wonderfully important about. You're my most prized possession. and what do you suppose it was about her that he wanted to parade her intellect no doubt she was going to come and do math problems for them her business savvy her political prowess no her value to him and her value to the men at the party was how she looked verse 11 says that he ordered Queen Vashti before him in order to display her beauty to the people, for she was beautiful. Queen Vashti was the quintessential trophy wife whose job it was to do two things. Number one, make her husband look good and make her husband feel good. That was her job. Might not have been said, but that was clearly her job. Now, note, back off this and get the bigger picture on this whole thing. In a world that says who you are is how you look, and that was clearly Vashti's world, when you're on top of that world, see, some of us get this idea that, you know, these rules are really hard on people who don't measure up, and the ones who make it to the top, they're the lucky ones. Hear this from Vashti's person. Vashti had made it to the top. She was the most beautiful woman. That's how she became the queen. When you are living in that world and you're at the top, you need to know that it's not enough to attract one man, get married, begin to build a family. You've got to be able to attract every man. You've got to be able to turn every head at the party. Some people like that. And while you may think there's a truth, some women like that. I was interested to run across this quote recently, Kathleen Turner, movie star. some years ago in her prime was quoted as saying this. When I'm on and I walk into a room, the only men who don't want me must be gay. Well, she found her power there. And that's how you get it. That's how you get your power in a system that says who you are is how you look. If you have the right look, you can get the power. And then you can learn to use the power. Back to the story. The king, Ahasuerus, calls the queen Vashti, desiring to display her like a prize steer at the state fair. And she throws him, however, a knock-you-down curveball when she says one word, read my lips, no. Verse 12. But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command. Display myself to a bunch of men after seven days of Miller time? I don't think so. Now, we really don't know how this went down, but she was at her own party, and this might have given her some courage to come up with this. No. And she was around some people, I think, who probably were her friends, and obviously there were some servants and stuff who really weren't in a relationship with her, but she was around some people who were supporting her just as a person. And when this thing came up and they knew the scene and they saw her rise up to say, no, this was a huge thing that she was doing. She was breaking the rules in a big time, and I'm sure, I mean, if it was in a vernacular today, she'd be walking out the door and all the other women would be going, you go, girl, you go do it, you're fighting this one for us. And she's going to begin the whole movement. it's not going to last long the king predictably blows a gasket end of verse 12 then the king became very angry and his wrath burned within him why well it's obvious why his wrath is burning in him because her refusal to do what he wanted struck the very center of his identity see both of these people have very frail identities her identity is in her looks and his identity is that he looks strong and competent and in control. Both of those things are incredibly frail, really insecure people. So when she said no, he couldn't take a no. That strikes at his sense of power and dominance and control made him look weak. You just can't look weak, just like you can't look, the woman couldn't look bad. Here's the rules. In a system where how you look is who you are. Women have to look beautiful and men have to look strong. Men have to make money. That's what makes you desirable. That's why I might have a relationship with you if you're successful and you win. So men and women are getting ripped off in this culture, some more than others, but everybody's the victim and everybody's insecure and everybody's posturing. Verse 13 to 18, Ahasuerus calls his advisors, literally the equivalent of the Supreme Court, which is pretty amazing, feels like overkill. Then the king said to the wise men who understood the times, for it was the custom of the king, so to speak, before all who knew law and justice, the supreme court. Their real fear was this, verse 17. This is interesting. The queen's conduct will become known to all the other women, causing them to look with contempt on their husbands by saying, King of Heres commanded Queen Vashti to be brought into his presence, but she didn't come. This day, the ladies of Persia and media who have heard the queen's conduct will speak in the same way to all the king's princes, and there's going to be plenty of anger and contempt. If this word spreads, in other words, the wives will no longer see themselves as slaves to their husbands, they'll all start saying no, and civilization as we know it will be destroyed. I don't know about civilization, but I got news for you, pal. Life as you know it will be destroyed. And that was indeed their fear. Verse 19, they came up with a solution that came in the form of an edict. Vasti should no more come into the presence of the king. Now, before we go into the very hurtful piece of this, because it is hurtful, my first reaction to this was that struck me kind of funny. Because here's now the king commanding her to not do what she already wouldn't do. Really powerful guy. I mean, it reminded me of a guy trying to train a dog and he's not having any success. Every time he says, sit, the dog runs. Every time he says, run, the dog sits. every time he says, roll over, the dog plays dead. And he's gone nuts. He's very embarrassed. And so determined to win, that's what it's about. You've got to win. He decides to wait and just simply watch what the dog is going to do anyway and then order the dog to do what he's already doing. So when a dog runs, he goes, run. And when a dog sits, he goes, sit. And when a dog rolls over, he goes, roll over. I will be obeyed. Vashti refuses to come into the presence of the king, and the king says, I command you not to come into the presence of the king. I will be obeyed. Really strong guy. But the humor, whatever you can find in that, is really not there because it turns mean really quick. She's not coming into my presence. And let the king give her, verse 19, her royal position to another. She's being replaced. She's being banished. Give it to another who is more worthy than she. Who would be more worthy? Someone who plays by the rules. The process of her replacement begins in chapter 2, verse 1. And I don't know, take a wild guess what the criteria is going to be for the new queen. How she looks. Look at verse 2. Then the king's attendants who served him said, Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king, And let the king appoint overseers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather every beautiful young virgin to Susa the capital, to the harem, and to the custody of Haggai, the king's eunuch, who was in charge of the women, and let their cosmetics be given them. Then let the young lady who pleases the king be queen in the place of Vashti. And the matter pleased the king, and he did accordingly. Basically, what we have here is nothing more or less than a beauty contest. And the measure of these young women is going to be based on these two things, that she be, number one, physically attractive, and number two, that she be sexually desirable to the king. The winner is going to become the queen, and become then, by virtue of that, a trophy wife, who would have it very, very clear in her mind what the rules are. And the rules are this. Who you are is how you look. Enter now Esther. A young Jewish girl, orphaned as a child, adopted and raised by her cousin Mordecai, we're told in verse 7 that she was beautiful of form and face. She won the preliminary and became by that a finalist, was brought to Susa the capital to prepare for the ultimate contest before King Ahasuerus. Verse 12 indicates to us that this time of preparation took 12 months. 12 months of getting ready. all it tells us about the preparation specifically like right in the text is this six months of oil and myrrh that would get old wouldn't you think then six months of spices and cosmetics what's not specifically in the text but i was able to dig out by just some historic study is that this time of preparation also included aerobics training weightlifting stairmaster liposuction breast implants nose jobs tummy tummy tucks and lip augmentation it's absolutely intro. 12 months. That is a long time to get ready for a date, don't you think? In the end, Esther wins. Verse 15, end of the verse, and Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her. Verse 17, and the king loved Esther more than all the women. She found favor and kindness with him more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown, hate her queen instead of Vashti. And there's only one reason she made it was because of how she looked. Big surprise after that, verse 18, the king then gives another banquet. This time it's Esther's banquet. Now, while all of that is going on, and if this is a movie, all you're going to think the movie is about is about this young girl who's becoming a beauty queen and whatever that means, and you might even be angry at her right now. You're sold out. Anyway, all that's going on in her career is kind of being launched, and her life is full of possibilities. Something else is going on at the same time, much, much bigger than her, involving the very existence and destiny of the people of God, her people. It's introduced very subtly in chapter 2, verse 5, just kind of stuck in there. And if you just see it, you don't know that that means anything. All it says is this. Now there was a Jew in Susa the capital whose name was Mordecai. Are we to know that Mordecai is Esther's adoptive father? Verse 11 says this, And every day Mordecai walked back and forth to the court of the harem to see how Esther was and how she fared. Now, watching Mordecai go back and forth and present himself every day in the court of the harem was the right-hand man of the king, a man named Haman. What nobody would have known, and Mordecai certainly didn't know, and Mordecai probably didn't even know that Haman was watching him or that he was having an effect on Haman, was this, that Haman despised the Jew, the people of God. He despised them. I'll tell you a little bit more next week as to why. But he despised the people of God in general, but Mordecai in particular. But for no other reason than all of the venom that he had for the people of God was simply kind of transferring onto this one guy that he irritatingly saw. What's he doing? Who on right does that guy have to be here every day? He's in my face. Mordecai never said a word to him. He's just there, bugged him. And it grew and it grew. And out of that hatred, Haman began to develop a plan. Number one, to kill Mordecai, but to move way past that. This looked like the chance of a lifetime for him out of this killing of Mordecai and a way to kind of trip him up to earn a death sentence. He would, he thought, be able to rid the entire land of all the Jews committing upon them genocide. Now, in the end, as all of these events converge, Esther becomes the queen, Haman's plot to kill Mordecai, and the Jews begins to heat up. In the end, the only person, interestingly, who's going to be able to thwart the plot, intervene with the king, save Mordecai, and the people of God, is a young Jewish girl named Esther, who in a very short period of time is going to have to decide something that is thrust upon her simply by circumstance. It's the kind of, it's the way it happens usually to you and I, where at pivotal times in our lives, We are forced to decide, and the things she has to decide are three. Number one, who she is. Number two, what she wants. And number three, who she serves. Who am I? Primary question, am I the beauty queen, the mannequin with sex appeal? Am I a trophy wife, or am I the courageous servant of the living God? Is my career, this is a pretty 90s thing, Is my career that is going quite well right now, thank you very much, is my career all I have to care about? Or am I part of something bigger than myself that impacts a kingdom? Do I just look out for number one? Or am I part of a community? A community of faith for which I am willing to risk all that I have, comfort, status, indeed my very life. And not risk those things abstractly for God, but concretely for the people of God, some of whom I really don't like very much. Imagine, this is a young woman we're talking about. Imagine all of that resting on the shoulders of a young girl who until now has been treated as someone of great importance just because of how she looks. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't expect much substance from her. Would you? How do you think she's going to respond? Well, some of you who read the story know. If you haven't read the story and you don't know, you're going to have to come back next week. We're going to stop right there as it relates to the development of the story. That's as far as we're going to get where we are right now. What I want to do now is just back off. and in the time remaining, I'd like to ask you to do some work, just in your own spirit. And if you enter into this, it can be some work. It could even affect some journaling for the next couple of days. I hope it does. I want us to consider three questions that are designed to help us consider how we live as people of God in a world that says, folks, here's the rules. You don't like it, it doesn't matter. These are the rules. Who you are is how you look. That's the way it is. And you know what? It's not going to change. Question number one. How deeply have I bought into that rule? Notice I did not ask, have I bought into that rule? You have. So have I. From day one, this is the rule we have lived by. It's in the culture. It's in the genetics almost. It was part of Esther's culture. It's part of ours. The question is, how deeply have, and let's make it corporate as well, have we, even as God's people, bought into this rule? Let me ask the same question in a different way. In what ways do I unwittingly perpetuate the strongly held idea that physical beauty, outward appearance, right clothes, right style, measure a person's value? Same question, asked in a different way. Am I sensitive at all to how this obsession with how people look can damage the hearts and souls of people, men and women, boys and girls, who are made in the image of God? Same question, a different way. How cool, how funny, how pretty, how rich, how athletic, smart, connected, popular and powerful do people have to be to hang with you? to be in your small group to be a person that you would call friend you know one of the things we're talking a lot about in our church these days and it's part of a vision that God has given us as a church that we become more and more a community and it's a hard thing to do with a church our size but we're really committed to at least setting up the structure where people who want that can find that here. But I'll tell you what, if community is going to happen and that is going to happen in a substantial way, this kind of dynamic is a huge issue. It's one we've talked about before and it's one we need to revisit from time to time. Do you remember back in James 2, verse 1? Some of you might be thinking of it even as I say this. Several months ago, we heard James to us say this. Brethren, do not hold your faith in the glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism. And literally what that meant, do not hold an attitude of personal favoritism and your faith in Christ at the same time. You've got to drop one, because they are absolutely inconsistent with each other. And personal favoritism we came to mean literally meant to judge things by the face. Remember that? To judge the value of a human soul simply by the face of things. And James gave the illustration of a person who would walk in arrayed with fine linen and gold on his fingers and obviously wealthy. And maybe he can do something for us. And so he gets the chief seat. And someone else walks in and they don't look as good. And so he kind of shuffled them off to the side. And James, with tremendously animated language and powerful verbiage, speaks of the danger of that. When, especially in the people of God, that happens, you need to understand that that diminishes the glory of God in the body. It debilitates the work of God. It dishonors the poor. It destroys your ability to rightly discern. And what that was about was if you just decide that the rich guy has more value and the poor guy doesn't, you may have totally missed it, that the rich guy who came in might be absolutely void of faith, Nothing at all to give to the body of Christ. Entirely self-absorbed, he might be. And the one who you thought was worthless, was full of the life of God, had tremendous things of great spiritual wealth to give the body of Christ. But you discerned wrongly. Sometimes, by the way, with messages like this, you can flip it around and do exactly the opposite thing. We go, oh, that's right, we despise now the rich. And if you look good, we'll give you the lousy seat. I mean, this whole thing can get turned around. And you can continue to judge people on the face of things. And so if you see somebody who really does look good and they're well arrayed, you decide they're superficial and shallow. Well, you're doing the same thing. You're judging on the face of things. James goes as far as to say that when we do that, it calls into question the very authenticity of your faith. Whatever else it does, it destroys community. The point is this. This is a big deal. Karen Lee Thorpe wrote a book called Why Beauty Matters. In it, she cited the results of several studies. Among them were these results. Adults, smile, coo, kiss, and hold babies that are rated pretty much more than babies that are rated by somebody. plain. Fathers are more involved with attractive babies than babies that are rated by somebody plain. Children learn early that being cute is the key to love. And then when I think of the quote out of this book earlier, some girl who spent her adolescent years running the proverbial gauntlet, learns pretty quick too what it takes to be loved. Even children's stories reinforce this, Thorpe contends. Listen to this. The prince was not enraptured with Cinderella's intelligent, sensitive conversation. He was smitten by her wardrobe and her teeny tiny feet. Snow, this one's even better. Snow White and Sleeping Beauty netted their men while comatose. Think on that. Not a lot of room for conversation there. But you don't need conversation when who you are is how you look. Who needs to talk? And then the prince kisses Snow White, and the music starts, and they walk off into the distance. You see him walking, and they lived happily ever after. It was a lie. It was a lie. See, they had this wonderful experience, and it was just all built on that. And then later in a whole other episode, he finds out that she can talk, and she has an opinion. And that's a whole other story. And that story is called life. Judith Couchman, another author, cited one study that said horrifyingly this. 11% of Americans today say they would abort a fetus if they knew that it tended to obesity. Here's a question again. people of God, how deeply have we bought into the rule that who you are is how you look? This is a huge question. In what ways do we unwittingly perpetuate that evil idea? Are we sensitive at all to how this obsession with how people look can damage the hearts and souls of men and women, boys and girls, made in the image of God? And as you consider that reality about the culture we live in, dream now with me for just a moment about being part of a community of faith that says, we don't like that rule. We are going to break that rule. And while that rule might be true everywhere else in life, that rule is not going to be true here. We're going to make a new rule, 1 Samuel 16. Man does look on the outward appearance, but God looks on the heart, and that is where we are going to be ever learning to look. That's what we will value more and more and more. Things like faith and fidelity and purity and truth. Things like mercy, kindness, grace, and character. The value of a human soul regardless of the face of things. and then the church truly becomes a place of refuge not the church organized but the body of Christ who are living out this kind of faith and way of thinking it's a new mind it's a new attitude it's born of the spirit of God it is the heart of God second question am I personally overly concerned with my own physical appearance. The reason I ask this is this. I think there's a lot of people here who would have very strong feelings about the first question. In fact, get awfully angry about being in a system or being part of the system or having any kind of interchange with someone who would judge somebody else simply on the face of things and not be concerned about character and heart and all those things and have a lot of energy about that and feel, quite frankly, like while they probably have room to grow, they do pretty well at not doing that. But while you would never devalue somebody else by how they look, you devalue yourself all the time by how you look. For you to go outside the house, it has to be just perfect. Well, something's up there. Let's talk about aging. Just use that as one of the ways to look at this. Aging, in our culture, without a doubt, is something that we are taught almost to fear, avoid at all costs, every way we possibly can, deny, even sometimes despise. These shopping channels, you get to these shopping things and they are always selling things. Recently, someone encouraged women to buy a product that would biologically tighten their skin for $92. Good deal. Another offered what was called cellular therapy for $225 a bottle. That's a deal at half the price. That was a joke. Clinique. C-L-I-N-I-Q-U-E. Spelled up for the guys. Clinique. It's French. It's the only French I know. Guys, Clinique is like this skin cream thing. I just wanted to help them out. Clinique encourages people to exfoliate daily. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Oh, I read that. Exfoli... What is that? And then I read it, and I was confused, because I thought that simply is what naturally happens if you have enough fiber and have a good cup of coffee in the morning daily. It's at 7 o'clock, 9 o'clock. Now, I wanted to tell you why I went ahead with that little joke right there, because my wife is out of town. I'm doing it all three services. Ultima, Ultima, another product. Ominously warns premature aging. Don't let it happen to you. It's every woman's worst nightmare come true. Worst nightmare come true. Amazing. Worse. It isn't muggings, personal attack, financial ruin, Freddy Krueger, Ted Bundy, Al Bundy, Homer Simpson. No. The skin-conscious woman can face those terrors head-on. No problem. What keeps this person up all night, wakes her up with cold sweats, is just the thought of premature aging. Makes your skin crawl. Which means even more wrinkles. What's that about? Why do people buy into that? I'll tell you why we buy into that. And we do buy into that. Because we know the rules. We know how it works. Here's how it works. Every spot, and let yourself get sad about this, every spot, every wrinkle, every bulge marks down the list price. Diminishes your value because who you are is how you look, but not with God. And not in the community of faith where amazing grace is the rule. I want to flip this around with you just for a minute And try to stir something up with you as it relates to hope and vision If this is true what I'm talking about And I think it is true This is pervasive in our culture Every one of us have to deal with it in a different way Men and women This is about Esther so I did the women thing hard But men have different things that we're going nuts to try to earn our value from. And if that's true, think with me about this. What an opportunity we have as a community of faith where amazing grace is the rule to be a haven of rest for people who've spent every day the last week living and being judged by that rule to be able to come among a people where the rules are going to be different. Do you have any idea the stories of some of the people who come through our doors every week? I don't mean just on the weekend, but I mean all week long and are part of the community of faith in our church. And some of you do know the stories because they're your stories. Where you've been raised your whole life and been beaten up and beaten down and you've tried so hard to keep it up. And some of you have kept it up really quite well. And some, even though you're keeping it up really quite well, inside there's this vacuum. And you can't even articulate it, but there's this ache in your heart for some place, a group of friends. Kim read something from a book where we could actually be unguarded with one another. And it wouldn't be about this. What an opportunity when there's such a dearth of this for the church to rise up and be the church where amazing grace lives in community. Oh God, help us do this and flesh this out here. Third question. Got to do this quickly. Do I spend anywhere near as much time, money, and energy on things that develop my heart for God, issuing in love, mercy, grace, and kindness as I do power walking, jogging, lifting, swimming, dressing, issuing in things like health, vigor, and strength. All of those good things. There's nothing wrong with those things. I mean, work out, eat right, comb your hair, take a bath, iron your shirt. Those are all good things. We don't want to go to the other extreme. In fact, what we're talking about here is being a people who live a life of balance. Say it this way, think on it this way. The preoccupation we have with outward development is primarily driven by this question, will you love me? And I drive and I look and hopefully you'll be okay with me. You'll like me and I'll be valued. You'll be valued if you look just right and you attain something. But the question that drives it is, will you love me? When we move past that and begin to give attention to inward spiritual development, you need to understand that that is driven by an entirely different question. The question is no longer, will you love me? The question I'm asking myself now is, do I love them? Am I growing in love? Am I learning to be kind? Am I growing in grace? Do I easily dispense mercy? Do I know how to forgive? Am I learning? Am I growing in these things? Am I part of a community that holds me accountable when I'm not? That encourages me when I am? That deeply desires to dispense these things to every single soul that walks through the doors of this church? Philip Yancey, in his amazing, wonderful book called What's So Amazing About Grace, tells at the time that a colleague once caught the agnostic actor-comedian W.C. Fields in his dressing room reading a Bible. Well, that's the last thing a guy like W.C. Fields would be doing. Embarrassed, he snapped the book shut and explained, just looking for loopholes. Looking for loopholes? That's a classic line. speculates. Maybe he was looking for grace. Might there in here be hope even for me? The fact is this, we live in a world that is starving for grace. Gave the picture earlier in the talk of a woman with anorexia weighing 52 pounds. Picture in your mind, women, men and women in our culture who physically are anorexic, the very vision of physical health, but their souls, our souls are anorexic. Men and women desperate for a place that says the rules are different here. How you look does not determine who you are. What you drive, what you wear, what you accomplish, where you live does not determine your value to us, a community of grace and mercy, of kindness and faith. Let me just close with this simple question. Is there anything in you that stirs and says, boy, I really want to not just be part of a community like that, but I'll tell you what, I really want to be part of building a community like that. Join us. Because I really do. I really do. More on Esther next week. I'd like you to stand as we're dismissed. I'm going to close in prayer, but I want the altar team to come and take your place in front, anyone who needs prayer for anything. And I would think that we possibly touched on some things that would be hurtful for some, need some prayer, but there may be anything that you need. But I'd like to pray as we close. Let's pray. Lord, I pray in your name that you would help us to become more and more the kind of community where every human soul is valued, loved, and prized, where we learn more and more to look past the face of things and see people the way you really do. And Lord, I thank you for the story of a brave, courageous young woman named Esther who defied the evil system and dared in a godly way to say no. Help us to, in godly ways, break the rules. Be a community of faith that's safe for humanity to come and experience amazing grace. Pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
