Amen. Well, you maybe saw me hobble up here. I've been told that it's an old man injury. I was told that yesterday morning on the racquetball court by my son while I was writhing on the floor. I played Caleb racquetball Saturday mornings a lot, and yesterday in the middle of the game, this thing in my calf just went pow. And I think it is an old man injury. I'm 53. It's never happened. So anyway. We're also practicing for when I actually am old. It will take me twice that long to get up here. So I'm just trying to get these guys ready for all of that. Anyway. Whatever. Let's pray. Let's pray as we go to the Word. Father, one of the things going through my mind relative to this word is what your word says about your word. When it really is your word being delivered to your people, your word will not return void, without the intended effect. And so I pray first of all that this word would indeed be discerned by those who know you as being a word from you. And the second desire, the second request in prayer is that it would indeed not return without the desired effect. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Though I am not entirely sure of this, I think it is a safe bet to assume that most of the people in this room would agree that Jesus Christ was, among other things, the greatest teacher who ever lived. It was his teaching about God and human nature, about relationships and how life works in general, that captivated a whole society in Jesus' day and for 2,000 years since Jesus' day has been the focus of some of the greatest minds in all the world. Indeed, there has never been any other human being in all of history whose teaching has had more impacts, prompting the founding of more colleges, the writing of more books, the changing of more lives than the teaching of Jesus Christ, causing people like you and me, ordinary people like you and me, to decide that, in fact, the best way to live is to follow his teaching, is to follow his way. So don't just cheer for me, we've been saying for several weeks, and we kind of thought it was in preparation for Easter, but this is the theme of our journey with God. Don't just cheer for me. Don't just sing songs about me. I want you to follow me into a different kind of life altogether. It's interesting, therefore, that as you consider Jesus being the greatest teacher who ever lived, that the greatest teacher who ever lived spent more time talking about money than any other subject, other than the kingdom of God itself. He talked more about money than anger, pride, lust, or love. More than those things, he talked about drachmas and shekels and talents and gold. So it is today. We're going to talk about money. So we're locking the doors. The room has been sealed. There is no escape. The question is why. Not why are we going to talk about it, but why did Jesus talk about money more than anything else other than the kingdom of God? It's a good question to wonder about. I mean, was it because he was in constant fundraising mode? Always had financial problems, and so he's always just kind of prodding people all the time. I don't think so. Neither do you. In fact, he was pretty much homeless, I think. We don't have record of him owning a home. Not as bad to own a home, but I don't think he did. His ministry had no set location or building to support. None of his disciples were on salary that we know of. He paid taxes by pulling coins out of a fish's mouth. And his entire finance department consisted of Judas. So why did he talk so much about money? Was it because the culture in which he lived and the people with whom he dealt were so affluent? And so they were constantly being overwhelmed with appeals to consumerism and materialism. I don't think that's why he talked about money. In fact, you know that the vast majority of the people Jesus lived with and ministered to were just like him, Jewish peasants. So he didn't talk to them about money to constantly confront them about their excessive materialism. I'm going to do that. No, see, I believe, and this is where we need to dial in. I believe that the reason he talks so much about money is because he knew. See, the greatest teacher who ever lived knew. Something about people and what he knew about people, you and me, is that regardless of what people have or do not have, few things have more power than money to reveal the real condition of the human heart. Because money, for many, many people, is the primary resource outside of God that most human beings look for, for what they need most. and we can sing our songs and it's only you except for this. Money has a lot of power. It really does. Feel vulnerable, a little insecure. Money promises to make us secure. We call them securities. It's a source of security. Giving anything that is a source of security means it has God-like characteristics and power. We say we believe in God and sing of trusting him, But money is what often makes me feel secure. It's what helps me sleep at night if I have it. It's what keeps me up at night if I don't. Lots of fear sometimes is kind of just hovering around money. It's often what helps me face my future with either confidence or fear. So don't be messing. See, when you talk about money, you're doing more than talk about money. You're messing with my security. Don't be talking to me about my source of security. Money's got a lot of power. You feel insignificant? Money can solve that too. You know, it's funny because I think most of us do indeed claim and kind of in our hearts someplace believe that true wealth is measured by the friends you have. I think you'd all agree with that. Yeah, that's really true. But how many reality shows are there on TV entitled, Who Wants to Be a Really Good Friend? You just don't have those things Indeed reality shows Reality shows Are about people who are willing to betray their friends For what? Money That's reality Feel dissatisfied or bored? Money promises gratification In a recent copy of a magazine entitled The Good Life there was an advertisement extolling the virtues of a very expensive car. The byline said, you can't buy happiness, but now you can lease it. Even the names of some cars, I'm kind of into cars, even the names of some cars seem to promise something bigger than life. It's bigger than life. I got an infinity. It's just, it's infinity. Millennium. Quest. You know, when we were kids, when I was a kid, we had cars like ramblers. Like, you know, because they rambled, you know. There was a car called an ambassador by the same car company, an ambassador. It's like cars that help people. You're lost, you go to the embassy, there's an ambassador. I'll buy that car. They had cars called gremlins, and my dad, they had cars called the pacer. Remember the pacer? I was in college. My dad bought a pacer. I thought my dad was so cool. He bought a pacer and his cool caution went in the tank. It was like, Dad, you've got to recover. Anyway, I digress here. Here's the deal. Jesus is not a naive dreamer on this subject of money. The greatest teacher who ever lived understood how the human heart is captured and deceived. all of our hearts can be captured and deceived by money. And that's at least part of the reason that he talked about it as much as he did. So what's the kingdom of heaven like? To what can I compare? It's like a man who found a treasure hidden in a field or it's like a man who found a pearl worth a lot of what? Money. And what is forgiveness like? To what can I compare? It's like someone who owes a lot of money and then you swallow the debt. and what is faithfulness like to what can I compare it it's like an employer who leaves you a whole lot of money and you manage it really well because you know it isn't yours to begin with and what is Satan like to what can I compare Satan he's like a thief who breaks into your house and steals all your stuff all your money and what's conversion like from the viewpoint of God how does God feel about it when people turn their hearts and come back home it's like a woman who lost a lot of what? Money. But then she finds the coin that rolled away and then it sets up great rejoicing and she calls all her friends and they have a great party and it's a picture of the joy in heaven when that lost coin. Why does he keep using that analogy? Because Jesus, the greatest teacher who ever lived, knows that when you start talking about money people's heads pop up and they start to listen either in some defensive way or they just get it. They get these things that speak to things we value. You see, he knew that money also, as well as being something that can be used for very good things and blessed in wonderful ways, he also knew this, that money is the number one rival to God in the human heart, which is precisely why he says things like this in Matthew 6, 24. No one can serve two masters, so you have to decide. for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will hold to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. Some of your translations say you cannot serve God and money. I looked for the translation that said mammon because I think it communicates because mammon is not just physical money. There's nothing wrong with physical money. Mammon communicates something else. It's more than physical money. It is a rival. God, I've taught on this before. Indeed, I believe, as many of you know, if you've heard my teaching on this, that mammon, when we're speaking of mammon, mammon is a principality, it is a power, it is a ruler of a spiritual force of wickedness in the heavenly places, if you will, behind money. It isn't money, it's this spiritual force behind money whose job it is to seduce people like you and me into believing that in money there is life and joy and peace, that in money there are the things you need that only God can give. And if you believe that in money you can find life and joy and peace, you will believe, and by the word, if you believe that, it's all about faith. What you believe, that money is the true source of those things, I promise you, then you will pursue it, grasp it, hoard it, serve it, in one way or another. You may not be raising your hands to it and singing songs because we're too subtle for that. Ultimately, you will worship it and ultimately be enslaved to it, and fear will be all around it. Richard Foster, in his book, Money, Sex, and Power, says this about mammon. When Jesus declares you cannot serve God in mammon, he is personifying mammon as a rival God, as I just said. He is making it unmistakably clear that money is not some impersonal medium of exchange. It is a spirit that has power and seeks to dominate us. And get this clear as well. Slavery to mammon is not manifested in either wealth or poverty, as if wealth or having money is an indicator that you somehow bowed to mammon, and poverty is an indicator that you haven't bowed to mammon. That isn't true. Slavery to mammon is manifested in that regardless of what you have or do not have, it is never enough. You're never content. So you pursue it, grasp it, hoard it, store it, serve it, worship it, ultimately become a slave to it, and fear is all around it. Listen, it sounds like I'm kind of splitting hairs here, but the Bible does not say money is the root of all evil. It isn't. The Bible says that the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil, And Mammon's task is to seduce you and me into that love, into believing that money can give you what your soul so desperately needs. It is a rival God. Therefore, to break its power needs some serious attention, I think. And by the way, all of that is why, at least in part, the greatest teacher who ever lived talked a lot about shekels and drachmas and silver and gold. And it's why we need to talk about it as well. A friend of mine this week asked me, where are you going Sunday? He didn't mean where I was going after church. He meant, what are you going to preach on Sunday? We've been in the series for Easter. We've been on this journey with the Holy Spirit. Are you going back to that? What are you preaching Sunday? And I told him I'm talking about money. I'm going to be talking about giving. And he asked, well, is there a problem with the giving at church? The assumption being, if you can talk about giving, because you're going to yell at us. So anyway, here's the deal about that. Here's the deal about that. If we had no financial problems at all, none at all, if all the financial needs and dreams of the church ministry here were fully funded, were completely met, if the tithing fairy came and sprinkled money dust on our church so that every ministry and dream for ministry was fully funded, We would still have to challenge ourselves around money. Because the real issue is this. I'm not kidding about this. The real issue is this. It's not, have we made our budget? The real issue is this. Who is our God? Because very few things, beloved, this is hard, very few things have more power to reveal the real answer to that question than how we feel about, relate to, handle, and give money. Because it's not just money. It has God-like qualities. It's in our life. We have to have it. And how we handle that has incredible things to say about our heart and whether or not we're following or just cheering him. Ron Sider, in a recent book that he wrote, entitled The Scandal of the Evangelical Conscience, an excerpt of which I recently read in a magazine entitled Books in Culture. If you're looking for a very interesting, provocative magazine, maybe you've never heard of that. I really recommend that, Books in Culture. And Sider, in this article, was basically saying that there's an awful lot of people who call themselves born-again evangelical Christians who don't seem to be actual followers of Jesus' way at all, like using my terminology, he didn't say this, but a lot of people cheer and sing their songs and raise their hands, but they aren't following the way of Jesus at all, born-again evangelical Christians, in four rather significant arenas of life, divorce, materialism, sex, and racism. Indeed, he says, and now I'm quoting him, the findings in numerous national polls conducted by respected pollsters like the Gallup Organization and the Barna Group hand us survey after survey, demonstrating that evangelical Christians are as likely to embrace lifestyles every bit as hedonistic, materialistic, self-centered, and sexually immoral as the world in general. Divorce, for instance, is more common among born-again Christians than in the general American population. White evangelicals are the most likely to object to having neighbors of another race. Sexual promiscuity among evangelical young people is only a little less outrageous than that of their non-evangelical peers. and while American Christians live in the richest nation on earth enjoying an average household income a household income would be double income whatever is in that household, not just one an average household income of $42,400 it seems however that the richer we've gotten the less we've given only 6% of evangelical Christians tithe that's 94% of evangelicals who don't tithe and then it went on to give some more statistics The average American, not necessarily Christian, the average American gives 2.5% of their income to what they would call good causes, get tax deductions, for whatever reasons they do it, good heartedness. The average evangelical Christian in America gives 3.5. It's just not that much different. In light of that, I love it. Point number one is a really hard point. Because point number one of this talk is this. very few things have more power than money. Very few things. You can walk around that all you want. Fact is, I believe, very few things have more power than money to reveal the true condition of the human heart. You know, when we think about the heart, I don't know if that's true because I have a good heart. When we think about the heart, I think a lot of times we confuse it with sentiment. I mean, he has a really good heart. How do you know he cries at movies? Ouch. Evidently, I can't tell that joke. I don't know. You know, God's up here going, nail him every time he goes too far. No, it wasn't true. I like that joke. I'm doing it again. Eugene Peterson, actually, in a book he wrote called Leap Over a Wall, speaks to this when he makes an important distinction between mere sentiment and authentic compassion that exposes itself in true generosity. He says this, we live in an age that has replaced compassionate and active generosity giving with sentiment. Sentiment is a feeling disconnected from relationship or doing. Sentiment is spilled generosity. It looks like compassion. It could develop into generosity, but it never does. Sentiment is tears that flow at a sad movie, tears that never get connected to visiting a dying friend. We feel sorry for people. We truly lament the pain and suffering in the world, but having felt the internal emotions of pity, wept a few requisite tears of sorrow, sent off 10 bucks to a charitable appeal, we returned to our homes and jobs without knowing the names of the people we've shed tears over, without visiting a single prisoner whose fate we lament, without writing one letter to the lonely over whom our heart has ostensibly been broken. I think sentiment is what a lot of people do in church, we feel moved, but we never move. So let's quit feeling sentimental about Jesus and follow him. You know, I was even, well, I always dial into our worship songs, but I was listening to some of them today, and one of the lines went something like, we worship only you, we worship only you. And I just thought, you know, sometimes it would be appropriate to be singing a song like that and just stop, not as a whole group, but as you, we worship only you. It just feels so good. I get tears, but it's only you. And then just, oh God, Lord, show me all the other things I worshiped in you. How'd worship go today? It would all be about how you felt, wouldn't it? How'd worship go? See, I wonder sometimes, if you want to know how worship went, check the offering. I was supposed to get more of a laugh. I didn't get any. well I'm out on a limb here let me tell you what I mean by that see some of you in fact when that thought first went through my mind I thought if the worship's really good then the offering is that what you mean? if the worship really moves people then they'll give more no that's not what I meant I meant the offering is worship that's doing something it's beyond feeling warm and gooey very few things are more power than money to reveal the heart. Let me add another point. Very few things have more power than money to change the human heart, making this an issue of spiritual formation. Hang with me on this one. Matthew 6, 19, a fairly common verse. You're familiar with this relative to money. It says, don't lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust destroy, where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where there are no thieves and there is no rust. Now here's the verse I want to dial in today. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Say it a different way, there will your heart go also. See, we tend to think about it differently, and it's not wrong to think about it this way, but we tend to think primarily as it relates to money and its connection to the heart this way, that if you give someone an emotional appeal, you win their heart, the money follows their heart. And that's true, and that's good. It reveals where you put your treasure, reveals your heart. But Jesus here is saying that the other thing is true as, well, it works another way. You invest your treasure in something, this verse says, your heart will follow it. You want to start caring about Microsoft? How many of you care about Microsoft? Maybe you do, maybe you don't. You want to start caring about Microsoft? Invest in it. Some of you don't look at the stock report at all. you want to start caring about the stock get some stock, you'll start caring about it your heart will follow where you invest, some of you gave and continue to give to our African Age Project and we're going to hear about it a little bit more, that project and some of the things we're doing outside our church to give ourselves away and some of you give and have given to that because your heart was there and because your heart was there and your heart was moved, your money followed and please hear me, that's a good thing that is right But let me tell you something else. Some of you need to give to the AIDS project or to the poor or to something else like it because your heart will follow and some of you need a change of heart. I was going to a spiritual director, I don't know, a couple years ago, and I was meeting with him and I was going through just this dry time. It wasn't quite depression. I was calling it that, but it was more just the blues. and I was like blah and he was going well you try this and try that and one day I went to him and he says Dave why don't you go why don't you go and feed the poor and I go feed the poor I don't see the connection and it wasn't until a week or so later that it dawned on me what he was very gently saying to me what he was very gently saying to me was Dave get over yourself get over yourself give something away and your heart will go there and it will affect your heart. Keep waiting for sentimental feelings and then it'll go and it's always about an emotional appeal. Very few things reveal the human heart. Very few things have power to change the human heart like how we handle our money. Now when we talk about money having the power to change our heart, now I want you to see it in the context of what I would call a spiritual discipline. a spiritual discipline very helpful in the process of formation is giving. In fact, I would go so far as to say this. There is no spiritual discipline that you could engage in that will have a more immediate, visceral, and formational effect than giving. Now, I think one of the most, probably the most formational thing that can happen to someone is pain. I think that if you look at your own life and you think of the things that have really changed you, when pain has happened, but pain is not a spiritual discipline. You don't start going, I'm going to beat myself up. I'm talking about a spiritual discipline that you could engage in. Very few things have the kind of power to immediately, viscerally, have a formational effect on you like giving does. Because every time you do it, every time you give, and like any spiritual discipline, it needs to be done regularly if you're going to enter into it. Every time you do it It will tangibly touch Promise It will tangibly touch your stuff And by stuff I don't just mean your physical stuff Though obviously that's what we're giving away When you give It will touch your fear I'm afraid if I give I won't It will touch your fear You want to deal with fear? Start giving It will touch your trust Or lack of it What do you trust? In God we trust It's written on our what? money. That's a lie. It's just a lie. You want to face that one down? Give. It'll touch your, there's nothing more tangible. Spiritual discipline you could enter into. It'll touch your contentment. It'll touch your narcissism. It'll touch your selfishness. It'll touch your love. What do you love? What do you love? What do you have to have? Gotta have, gotta have. It'll touch your faith. So, so go light some candles if you want and sit in a dark room. Oh Lord, thank you. It's good. it's good. But if you want to experience something that will change you quickly and affect you deeply, enter into this like a spiritual discipline. By the way, not only does giving have the power to have formational effect as a spiritual discipline, but nothing that I know of is more effective at a very practical level than breaking the grip of mammon that I described a bit ago? Like giving. Richard Swenson in his book Margin says it this way, Mammon's work, and by Mammon he does not mean money, he means the principality behind money. Mammon's work is the exact opposite of God's work. Given this opposition, we understand why Jesus demands a choice between God and Mammon. He is not speaking of just another power, just any other God. He is speaking of the one who goes directly against God's action. The one who makes non-grace reign in the world So before we can accomplish anything righteous with money, and we can accomplish righteous things with money, but before we can, we need to first understand this power, confront this power, and with the help of God, demolish this power. How do you do that? Well, he says, there is one act, par excellence, which actually profanes money. By going directly against the law of money, an act for which money is not made, that act is giving. Money was made to be taken. When we give money away, he says, we not only neutralize mammon's power over us, but we bring it into and place it under, we place it under the rule of God's kingdom. Non-grace is turned to grace, God is honored, and his right to rule in our lives is confirmed. Day after day after day after day, It needs to be a discipline. So please, quit cheering for me, says Jesus. I'd really be interested in people who want to follow me. By the way, this is why at Open Door we teach, not the tithe, but what we call the spirit of the tithe as embodied in Abraham. In Genesis 14, 22, my paraphrase, where Abraham came and said, Lord God, most high possessor of heaven and earth, everything I have belongs to you. And from that posture of life that says, everything I have belongs to you, he gave a tenth of all he had. And when practiced as a spiritual discipline, continually taking what has been received and earned and aligning it to the values of the kingdom, all of this belongs to you. And then giving out of that as a spiritual discipline, I can think of a few things more effective, not only at breaking the grip of mammon, but keeping you free from it. in the spiritual discipline of the time. One more thing. In 2 Corinthians 8, verse 2, there is a fascinating formula. Paul is writing to the Corinthians about the Macedonians, and he says this, that out of the most severe trial, their overwhelming joy and extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity. I'm gonna read that again. That out of severe trial, their overwhelming joy and extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity. It's just the strangest formula. You start with a severe trial, add a little overwhelming joy, add extreme poverty. Wait, stop right there for a second. Where do you find those two things together? I'm serious. Where do you find overwhelming joy and extreme poverty together? I mean, if you go into the grocery store looking for them, they're in different aisles, okay? But you stir all that together. Stir together a severe trial, Overwhelming joy, extreme poverty. And in this verse, it was like a chemical reaction. That thing got all stirred together and it welled up in what? Rich generosity they gave. It's interesting. There is tons of research now that very reliably indicates what an incredibly low correlation exists between someone's income level and happiness and overwhelming joy. The news on that one is in. And it's real clear. happiness and having stuff doesn't necessarily go together. Indeed, it's why this equation that we see in 2 Corinthians 8 is even possible that overwhelming joy and extreme poverty and severe trial could add up to rich generosity. But the flip side of that little equation is true as well. Try this one on. Let's add chronic discontent with unprecedented affluence. Let's add those together. What do you get? What do you get? Well, I think you get what we got in the culture we live in. Because I think what you get when you add chronic discontent with unprecedented affluence, what you get is a major giving disorder. And it's not just in the culture. It's in the church. And it's not just in the church. It's in our church. beloved we are living we are living and this is one of the things if we're going to be followers if we're going to follow the way of the rabbi and get really serious about that Easter we're going to have to face this one down beloved we are living in the context of a giving disorder of not only epidemic but unprecedented proportions American evangelicals gave a higher percentage of their income to causes consistent with the kingdom of God during the depression than they do today back to that Ron Sider quote American Christians live in the richest nation of the earth and enjoy an average household income of $42,409 I don't know how they come up with that anyway then he goes on the World Bank reports that 1.2 billion of the world's poorest people try to survive on one dollar a day at least one billion people have never heard the gospel John and Sylvia Ronsville who have been researching the giving patterns of American Christians for the last decade point out that if American Christians just tithed nothing more just tithe there would be another 143 billion dollars available to empower the poor and spread the gospel studies by the United Nations suggest that just an additional 70 to 80 billion dollars a year would be enough to provide access to essential services like basic health care and education for all of the poor for all of the poor of the earth if they did no more than tithe American Christians would have the private dollars to foot the entire bill and still have $60 to $70 billion left to fund church ministry and evangelize the world. Now, I know that sounds grandiose. The whole world, all of the poor of the earth, you know, just kind of glazes over. Those numbers are too big to have even a response to them. But the point is this. There is a direct correlation between what we physically do with our money. And what we physically do with our money is a spiritual issue. Try to separate that all the time. You can't. There is a direct correlation between what we physically do with our money and our hearts and our spiritual lives and our formation as followers of Christ. And a correlation between what we give and ministry success. I don't mean success in terms of being the biggest church in town. I mean in terms of affecting communities and people. In other words, any time any ministry happens, here or anywhere else, whether it's a wounded person getting healed or a hungry person getting fed or a desperate person finding hope or a naked person getting clothing or a child who can't read in North Minneapolis or Maple Grove getting tooted or a baby in Haiti being held or a marriage in Maple Grove being restored, it happens at least in part because of somebody's willingness to give something. of their time, of their talent, of their gifting, of their love, and of their money. It's a spiritual issue because of someone's rich generosity. I mean, if you're here today, and you are here today, and you can see because the lights are on. I mean, that's a big deal. If there's a seat for you to sit in that's comfortable and we don't have to go off into the woods because there's bathrooms right over there. I left it in. They didn't like it last night either. It's because someone gave. It's because lots of people gave and give generously, faithfully, joyfully. So today, whatever else I want to say, I want to say sincerely thank you. Thank you. For in ways small and large, Learning what it means to do more than cheer for him and raise our hands as we sing to him, but to be people who are learning how to follow him. But let me also say this. We have room to grow here. A lot of room to grow here. And I want to tell you something else. It's not just about making our budget. It's about becoming the kind of people who don't just cheer for him. raise their hands and sing songs to him. It's about becoming a people who are becoming more and more serious about wondering what it means to follow the way of the rabbi. And to by that become an entirely different kind of person. That's the kind of ministry I want to give the rest of my life to. To mobilizing people for that, to become that kind of person myself more and more and more. Want to come? Let's go. Just one final word about generosity. I assume something of you, and that's that you're generous, or that at least you want to be. I think people want to give, not just money, but they want to give. There's something in the heart that wants to do. There's a lot of ways we don't know how, and sometimes because we're so encumbered by some other things, we feel like we can't give because we're so, we've already bowed down so much to this money thing that we're in debt. There's nothing left to give. So some people need some help and I want to offer some of that. And we have some programs here at church to help with that. Good Sense Ministry is one. We're going to talk about it a little bit next week in some real practical terms to help people do what I assume they want to do and that is follow the way of Jesus. Would you stand with me as we close? Father I thank you that that your son Jesus through what he modeled and what he spoke made it real clear that he wasn't afraid of talking about this kind of stuff and went right toward those things that pulled at our hearts and rivaled allegiance to you and I'm just here to speak on behalf of us as a people to say there are other things we bow down to, Lord. We're not even always aware of them. But we don't want to. We don't want to be that kind of people. The kind of people that are going to affect this community. Maple Grove, the Twin Cities, our neighborhoods, our schools are going to be people who learn more and more to follow the way of the rabbi, Jesus, who learn more and more to give their life away. pray Jesus that in gentle ways but firm ways that call us to your grace and your life and your power more and more you would show us the ways we're content to just cheer for you refusing to follow you because what we want to do is follow you into an entirely different way of living may it be so among us may your kingdom come our Father who art in heaven hallowed be your name thy kingdom come and this is one way it does when we obey I'm going to ask the prayer team to be available for anyone who needs prayer for anything maybe particularly things that were stirred up this morning. The rest of you are dismissed. God bless you as you leave in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you.
