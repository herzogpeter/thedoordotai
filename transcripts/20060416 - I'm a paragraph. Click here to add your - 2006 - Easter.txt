I'm telling you the truth. Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains by itself, alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit. It comes to life. Because life wins. Love wins. God wins. But how do you know? Life wins. One way we know comes from places like Acts 2, verse 24. See, God raised him from the dead Freeing him, that is Jesus, from the agony of death Because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him So in the context of some monumental battle between life and death Death lost Romans 6 verse 8 says this If we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again because death no longer has mastery over him. No longer has mastery over him. Looked like for a while that death did have mastery over him, but in the end, death lost. 2 Timothy 1.10 says that it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who abolished death. Brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, prompting the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15, verse 55, to, in a way that borders on cockiness, mock death, to literally taunt it, saying, Death, where's your victory? See, I don't see it. It was here a while ago, but where did it go, death? Where's your victory? Oh, death, where is your sting? In fact, that verse in my view is kind of the spiritual equivalent of trash talk on a basketball court or even in a boxing ring where your opponent has just given you his best shot, unleash everything they have, but at the end of all of that flurry of violence even coming at you, you're still standing bruised, maybe bleeding, but still standing. And your opponent is entirely spent giving rise to a question delivered best with a little bit of sarcasm anyway. Is that all you got? Death? See, I'm confused. Where's your victory? I saw it Friday. But see, what you didn't know death was Friday was the first quarter of the game. Oh, you thought that was the whole. You thought the game was over, didn't you? Death, where's your victory? See, I don't see it. Oh, death, where is your sting? You know, I actually felt that sting for a while, and it hurt a lot, but even after all of that, I'm still standing. For God raised him up from the dead, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him, death no longer having mastery over him, for he has abolished death, bringing life and immortality to light through the gospel. Beloved, this is good news from the Lord. And yes, you can applaud that. Before I move now into the rest of this word, I just want to do something that I think needs to be done. If you were out there, you'd probably want this. I don't know where the camera is. Am I looking at it? I've been told there's about 400 people out in the gathering place who may not feel like you're part of what we're doing here. And I just want to acknowledge you. And hi. Terry came over to me and says, I think they're getting ripped off out there. And so, sorry. If you've been with us for the last several weeks, Actually, all of Lent, actually we even began before Lent this series of sermons. You're undoubtedly aware that we have been using these weeks prior to Easter to, in an intentional way, be preparing ourselves for today, for what we've been calling the coming of the cross, and to be listening as a people, as best we can, to what the cross event may be saying to us this season. We've been listening for themes. And among the most obvious theme we've been hearing this Easter, and the most obvious always at Easter, is this. I've already said it in my introduction. God wins. Over sin and death and hell, God wins. For God raised him from the dead, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him, no longer having mastery over him, for he abolished death. In other words, God wins. So whatever it is that you were fearing in Gethsemane, sweating drops of blood or whatever it was you were feeling on Calvary my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? you have to remember especially those of you who may still feel like you're in some kind of Gethsemane especially those of you who even as we're celebrating resurrection feel like you're going through something that is just going to kill you you need to remember that in the end God wins. And the reason we know it's true is because the one who descended also ascended. You know, it's almost become an Easter tradition around here that somewhere in the course of our Easter weekend celebration we need to be reminded of the fact that when Jesus finally did rise physically on the cross I'm sorry, that when Jesus finally did die physically on the cross on Friday, that he descended, according to Ephesians 4, verse 9, into the lower parts of the earth, which is symbolic language for hell, where he, according to 1 Peter 3, 19, made proclamation to Satan and all the demons of hell. And we think we know what he said, possibly just moments before his resurrection. We think what Jesus said to the demons of hell and Satan himself was this, what you meant for evil, God meant for good. What you supposed on Friday was your greatest victory, was in fact your most ultimate defeat. I win, you lose. Bye-bye. And he blew open the gates of hell, led captive a host of captives, took his seat at the right hand of the Father, sent his spirit to the church, distributed his gifts forever alive, for he who descended also ascended. And whatever else that means, it means this. God wins. Amen. Amen. Another theme that emerged in this series we've been in, focusing on the cross event, is this, love wins. We've been saying it this way, week after week, actually, when the worst that man and hell could do to inflict pain, humiliation, and death was met by Jesus on the cross with forgiveness, generosity, inclusion, and grace. Father, forgive them, he said, from the cross to the thief on his side. Today you will be with me in paradise, including him. When he was doing that, he was literally, for the first time in history, overcoming evil, not with more evil, but with good. And whatever else that means, it means this, love wins. But this year, in the course of these sermons and this examination we were doing, we took it further. Because beyond the cross declaring that love wins, We believe that the cross also confronts and eventually subverts every other way of living. Which means if we continue to live in such a way where we try to overcome evil with more evil, even if what we're trying to accomplish is a good thing, we may enjoy some short-term success. We may win the arguments. We may win the fight, the lawsuits. We may win. But in the end, we lose because in the end, it doesn't work. It doesn't work in relationships, churches, marriages, business. It doesn't work between nations. It doesn't work in traffic because when Jesus on the cross overwhelmed evil, this time not with more evil, which is the way we know how to do it. When Jesus on the cross, this time overwhelmed it with good, it changed forever how the universe works because now love wins. But all of that raised the question that we, again, grappled with for more than one week. The question is this, do we believe that? Peter didn't, at least not at first. Truth is, none of us do. Truth is, most of us learn these things by doing it wrong, don't you? I hope I'm not the only one Matthew 26 they're in the garden of Gethsemane you know the scene it's just prior to Jesus' arrest when behold verse 47 Judas one of the trusted twelve came up accompanied by a great multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priests and the elders of the people now he who was betraying him gave them a sign saying whomever I shall kiss he is the one sees him so Judas kisses him and the soldiers seize him. Be Peter for a moment watching all of this. The scene is chaotic and dangerous. If you're Peter, I think it's reasonable to assume you're scared and confused. You just saw Judas, who you trusted, betray the one you loved, the one that you thought he loved and it's happening fast. He doesn't know what to do. It doesn't seem like Jesus is doing anything and you need to do something so he pulls out a sword, does Peter, verse 51, and strikes the slave of the high priest, cutting off his ear. Because pulling out our sword, it's what we do when we're scared. It's what we do when we're afraid we might lose. It's what we do when other people pull out their swords. It's what we do when we've been betrayed. So he does what you do. When people come at you with swords, he pulled out his sword, cut off the slave's ear. One of the gospel accounts talks of how Jesus picked up the ear and put it back and healed the guy. He just put it back. I don't know. Stick in there. Anyway. But I just wonder how Jesus felt holding this guy's ear in his hand, about to go to the cross, and in going to the cross, demonstrating once and for all, there's a different way to do this. And Peter, who's going to end up being his, you know, the protoss, he is the number one, the lead apostle. And just moments before this whole thing, he still doesn't get it. And he's going, oh, amazing grace. It's just amazing grace. So Jesus says to Peter, verse 52, put your sword back in its place. For those who take up the sword will die by it. And that's not a mysterious statement. It simply means that eventually, if you use the sword, even if you win by the sword, by getting bigger than everybody else, even if you win for a while, somewhere along the line, someone along the line is going to have a bigger sword. It's going to have a faster sword or more swords or a bigger mouth or a better argument. Unless you think, by the way, that Jesus is telling Peter to put the sword away because he thinks they're outnumbered. And that would be one reason to put the sword away. Peter's the only one and there's only, what are you, an idiot? Not the time. You can't buy that if you buy the text. Because Jesus, talking to Peter, says, you need to know, Peter. You need to dial into this fact that I have at my disposal. Don't you think that I could have called on the Father right now and have at my disposal 12 legions of angels? 72,000 angels. Peter, the problem here, and the reason I want you to put your sword away, is not because we're outnumbered. The reason I want you to put the sword away is because I'm trying to show you a different way. Indeed, a couple of weeks ago, I pushed this so far as to say it this way, that Jesus didn't die on the cross just to forgive us of our sin, though he certainly did that, but he died on the cross to show us a different way of doing life. A different way, a kingdom of God's way, to declare once and for all that the only way to gain your life is to give your life away. That the only way to overcome evil is not with more evil, but with forgiveness, generosity, inclusion, and grace. So when he went to the cross, it was as if he was saying, I'm not kidding about that. And oh, by the way, I want you to not just cheer for me as I do this, I want you to join me in this way of living, which leads to the third theme that we've been hearing in this Easter season, the third thing that the cross has been saying to us. It's this, life wins. Life wins, which is something we're going to have to remember and believe if we really want to live this Jesus way. Because the truth is this, you know it's true. If we decide, if we as a church decide to follow him into this kind of life, we will sometimes feel like we are going to die. I mean, think about it. If I don't pull out my sword, when you pull out your sword, how on earth will I protect myself? When you come at me with a barb and I don't come back with one bigger and better. If we don't return evil for evil, how will we get what we want? How will we win? I suppose the answer to that is that somewhere along the line, we're going to have to become an authentic people of faith who actually believe that God wins that love wins that life wins indeed we'd have to believe that life springs forth from death and that sometimes for the life to spring forth something has to die even in us dying isn't the worst thing that can happen because when the seed dies it brings forth fruit we called it dying to live it may well be that this theme is what I will remember most about this Easter season that Easter 2006 was the year that we began to understand this and not just as individuals but as a body as a community of faith began to come to God and say God what does it mean to walk this way to live this way the primary text as you know I read it at the top of my sermon Anyway, John 12, 24, Jesus says, you remember, is preparing his disciples for the fact that he must suffer and die, trying to explain to them why suffering and death was something that had to happen. He says, here's why it has to happen, because unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit. It comes to life, because life wins. But he followed that. He didn't just leave that principle out there as if it only applied to him. He follows that in the next verse with this, that whoever serves me must follow me. As if to say this dying to live thing doesn't just apply to me. It applies to you as well, those who serve me and say they follow me. Indeed, it's universal. It's just the way life works in the kingdom of God. It may not work that way in other places, but this is how it works in the kingdom of God. and if you're desiring to bring the kingdom of God and not your own, this is how it works. Matthew 16, 21, same thing. Jesus is explaining to his disciples why he must go to Jerusalem, suffer many things at the hands of evil men, to then be killed but on the third day be raised to life. To which Peter said, Never, Lord, this thing shall never happen to you. To which Jesus said, Not only will this happen, this must happen. Peter, indeed, there are some things about this way of the cross that you don't want me to go to, Peter, that you need to go to, Peter, which is precisely what Jesus says two verses later in verse 24. For if anyone would come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross and follow me to literally follow this way of dying to live. All of which is why this Easter season, we as a congregation came to see and believe over these last seven weeks that the message of Easter is not just Jesus died on the cross so we wouldn't have to, but the message of Easter is this, that he died on the cross and rose from the dead to demonstrate once and for all that this is how you come to life. In fact, this is how you come to life every day. Not by grasping, but by releasing. But if you've ever released anything at all, be it large or small, something you were grasping, that process of letting that thing go feels like you're going to die. How will I live without that? But it's in the releasing, it's in the dying, that something comes to life. Not in the ascending, but in the descending. Paul, speaking of Jesus, said that he regarded equality with God not a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, humbled himself. The journey, the journey of faith, the Easter is the journey of descent, but you're not left in the pit, are you? The journey of descent, of dying, but then comes the life. Jesus humbled himself, become obedient unto death, and then God highly exalted him, gave him the name above every name. But first, the journey is dying to live, dying to live. And that is why the invitation This year, as we've been preparing for this day, has been this. Open door. Don't just cheer for me this Easter. I want you to cheer. And we cheered. Our worship, I felt like I was going to come out of my skin. But here is the message. It's been being delivered for several weeks. Don't just cheer for me this Easter that I died and rose again. What I really want, says the Lord, this year is that you follow me, that you join me in this universal pattern that is woven into the fabric of life in the kingdom of God, and the pattern is this, that life springs forth from death, that coming to life in the kingdom of God almost always involves a kind of dying, a letting go, sometimes a letting go of life itself. I talked a few weeks ago about Dave Busby, our friend of a church, as we saw his struggle with that and letting go. And every time he let go, he came to life. Last week, I was with my mom, and she's battling with cancer. That seems like it's going to take her. And you just watch a human being who is a kingdom person, grasp and then release, and grasp and then release. And in the releasing, there comes life. And one of the dearest friends of our church right now is going through this very process, Dick McCauley. We love him so. We love him so. And you just watch him grasp and then release, and then release, and then release, and then release. So that when I talked to him earlier in the week, you know what he talked about most? Hope. And it wasn't that he was gonna get better. It was that life wins. It's a letting go, sometimes of control. And this gets down to our everyday life. And every time you let go of control, you feel like you're gonna die. But when you actually do, something comes to life. Sometimes it's about letting go of what people think or the need to be right, the need to win. And every time you let those things go, it is a process of death. And something comes to life. We looked at this principle in the context of repentance and forgiveness and dealing with sin. Every time we repent, it's so obvious. You know it's true. Every time you repent, you say, oh my goodness, I'm wrong. and you quit denying it and concealing it and redefining it and blaming someone else for it. Every time you do that, it feels on the front end, it feels like you're going to die. But it's in the turning, in the repenting, that something comes to life. You know it's true. And all of that is why, for three weeks in a row, we ended our service with a question. What in you and me and us needs to die so that you and me and we can come to life. And that's why for three weeks in a row we had these seeds up here with little bowls of dirt. Remember that? Three weeks in a row we did that and you became a vivid symbol of this truth. Were these seeds and dirt, this truth that says unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains by itself alone. but if it dies, it comes to life. And it's why we invited you three weeks in a row to come, to take a seed, maybe several, as a tangible symbol of something in you that needed to die, to bury it in the dirt, because we believe that this is how things come to life. And the fact is this, you came, hundreds of you, over those three weeks, came and took the seed and put it in the dirt so that now today those seeds you buried have come to life. I wonder how many of you were wondering what all this grass is up here. You need to know because these are the very bowls of dirt that you put the seeds in. Three weeks ago, four weeks ago, whenever it was. And the symbol here is this. The symbol here is this. That the seed that dies comes to life. That's Easter right there. but as powerful as that symbolism is the truth for some maybe many among us is this that in the context of your actual life what's going on in your life right now even though this is Easter and we're all singing about life for many of you What's going on in your life right now is this. The truth is this. You can't see or feel this life at all. The seed, in a metaphor, has died and been buried, but the grass has not begun to grow in your life. Indeed, borrowing again from the journey of Jesus, some of you may still be in a Gethsemane of sorts. And Gethsemane, beloved, is the place of dread. where Jesus sweat drops of blood anticipating something inevitable, unavoidable, dreadful. And the reason he was going to this inevitable place was because of his obedience, because he said, yes to God, I will drink the cup. I don't want to go to that dreadful place. But then he said, yes, I will go. I will go. And now it was inevitable and he's going there. And it's a dreadful place. A couple of weeks ago, I was having to do something that I didn't want to do. Big deal. You have these kinds of things. I was having to say something that I didn't want to have to say. And I was filled with dread. And it bothered me. It kept me up one night. I'm going, I don't want to do this. I don't want to say that. And it kept me up one night. And I remember in the morning getting up and kind of bringing it to God and praying and journaling. And I began to wonder, Lord, what's wrong? It was right in the middle of these sermons I'm doing about dying to live. And if you die, life comes. And I kept going, Lord, what am I supposed to die to here? If I could just, you know, find the right thing, I'll feel release and all that stuff. And it was as clear as a bell. I don't hear voices, but it was like Jesus said to me. He said, you're in Gethsemane, Dave. And the only way out of Gethsemane is through Gethsemane. There are no magic pills in Gethsemane. Gethsemane is where you dread something that's coming. Gethsemane is where you sweat drops of blood. The only way through Gethsemane, though, is believing and knowing that as you go through what Gethsemane is about, there will be life on that end. See, some of you are in Gethsemane right now, anticipating and saying yes to something you know you have to do. Still others of you this morning may still be in the throes of dying in some sense, maybe even at that place of perceived abandonment. Or maybe you said yes to God to something that needed to die, and now it's dying, but it isn't dead, and you're in that place of, my God, why have you forsaken me in this? I obeyed you. Where'd you go? Oh, you are the ones this morning who most desperately on this Easter morning need to hear the Easter message. And the Easter message is this. Even if you don't feel it, the Easter message is this. God wins. Love wins. Life wins. How do you know, Dave? How do you know? Well, here's how we know. And here's why we believe. Because God raised him up again. A fact to which we are all witnesses, said Peter in Acts 2.32. And after he appeared to Peter and then to the 12, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15, 5, he appeared to more than 500 brethren at one time. And then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all, as it were to one untimely born, he appeared also to me, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him, no longer having mastery over him, for he has abolished death, bringing life and immortality to light in the gospel, all of which means God wins, love wins, life wins. Therefore, Paul ends both thoughts of victory in Jesus with these words, therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, always abounding in this desire you have to follow the Jesus way, knowing that your labor to live that way is not in vain in the Lord. So thanks be to God who gives us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord. Beloved, this is good news from the Lord. Amen. Thank you.
