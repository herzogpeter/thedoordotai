. and also to prepare ourselves for our time around the table. I've been asking to share on that thought that I gave four years ago. It is called the title, The Mary Miracle. The Mary Miracle, and it all began the story of it. The text I just read, I read, Luke chapter 1. This is 26 to 65. Can everybody turn and follow along? It continues on from the verses I read with this word. Coming in, the angel said to Mary, Hail Mary, Savior one. The Lord is listening. Hail Mary simply means rejoice, Mary. Get your joy up. I guess the good news for you, you don't know what it is yet, but it's going to screw you. So you are highly favored. The word favored shows up in verse 30. Well, the angel said to her, do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. Whatever else that word means, it means simply grace. You have found grace. You have been grace. Grace is coming to you, Mary. Indeed, grace is going to be placed inside of you. Hail Mary, soul of grace. Look, 1. 28. Later, verses 41 to 42. Same chapter. Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, said to Mary, Upon hearing the promise of God to her, blessed are you, Mary, for grace has come to you, for grace is going to be exceeding inside of you. And blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus put together. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. Jesus is not Catholic, who recognize those words as part of his devotion. Evangelicals recognize those words as the Catholic. Kind of not our word, but they're called Catholic. What we need to understand is that they aren't just Catholic words. Catholics have found their Bible words in chapter 1, verse 28, But sometimes for our response to those what we think are Catholic words, we are left with very little understanding and appreciation for what we are calling today, the Mary Miracle. The Mary Miracle is this forefold. The Son of God, by the work of the Holy Spirit, came alive inside Mary. The Son of God, by the work of the Holy Spirit, conceived in her the life of God. Verse 31, you will conceive. The second part of the miracle is this, the Son of God alive in her will not only be conceived in her, but that life will grow in her. Verse 31, and you will bear, or you will carry, or you will go through the process necessary for life. A son, you will bear this life in you. The third part of this very miracle is this, the Son of God alive in you that's growing in you will one day issue from you. will come to life through you, and you will call his name Jesus in the fourth dynamic of this very miracle, this very life that's conceived in you, grows in you, and one day will come from you, will change the world around you, and this life issuing from you will change the world around you, not necessarily because of you, you carry it and you are faithful and bad, But the thing that's going to change the world around you is him. For he, verse 33, verse 32, is great. That's why the life in you is going to change the world around you. For he will be great. He will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David. He will lay him to the house of Jesus. For his kingdom will have no end. The glory of this Mary miracle, or maybe I should call it the continuous glory of this Mary miracle, is this. It's a miracle that came to Mary 2,000 years ago, recorded here in Luke chapter 1. It can come to you as well. It can come to me, has come to me as well. Not in a physical sense, but in the physical way that Jesus bore in your body, the very life of God, that is Christ. That is unique. But in a spiritual sense, this miracle is played out over and over and over again in redemption. It's true indeed that it's essential to our redemption and to the reality of our regeneration. I believe it can be argued and may be best understood as Mary being what we call a prototype. That is, the first of a time we met. Mary is the first person in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, ever came alive inside of. But she is not the only person to whom that miracle has come. For since he came alive inside of her, he's also come alive inside of me and inside of many, many of you. 1 Peter 1.23, speaking of our amazing new generation, said it this way, You have been born again of a righteous seed that liveth and abides forever. The word seed there is rather graphic. This Greek word spermatai. And it has to do with sperm giving you the idea. This is the physical thing that has spiritual understanding. Life being born in you. Christ in you is your hope of living in a glorious way. Colossians 1, 27. So rejoice, Savior. Not just Mary, but you, to whom the life of God has come, been born in and grown in and come from. Get your joy up. I bring you goodness and great joy that the grace of God has come to you. The Son of God has come alive inside of you and is growing in you, will come from you and change the world around you. Mary did rejoice when she fully understood this miracle of grace that was going to come to her. Verse 46 to 55, she said this, My soul does magnify the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior. But that was not her first response. The first response was, I think, a probably one response to someone who is really hearing the message clearly, not being sold with goods or religious goods, with the full understanding of what the gospel brings and what it is and what it will accomplish in your life. A dynamic that's legitimate would mean to be a little bit afraid of this. The angel came and made his pronouncement, it says, for 49, that she was great in trouble. Why? Well, I ask for that one, well, the trouble in her spirit would be, me because an angel would be a winner. That would tend to disturb me a bit, especially if it spoke. It's not a trouble for her. Let me support you. Next verse 29 says that she was troubled at his statement. What he said is what troubled her. What do you mean, the Lord, is with me? What do you mean, I'm favored or grace? And in what way is this grace that's coming to me? What do you affect me and cause me to rejoice? And then in verses 31 to 33, the angel explained what it was that this was going to do inside of her. The life of God's Son, Jesus, Mary, is going to be conceived in you. I know you can't believe that. I know you can't conceive that, but the life of God's Son is going to come and be conceived in you, and then it's going to grow in you, and then it's going to manifest itself from you and change the world around you. But notice especially in verse 3, it says this, of all the things it's going to do in and through you, his kingdom, you need to understand, Mary, will have no end. That's important. But what it means, Mary, among other things, is this, that what I'm about to do in you, and what I'm about to do through you, if you receive it, and if you allow it, Once this work of my life in you is begun, it will have no stoppage. It will have no end, not just in the world. This kingdom will have no end in the world, and it will pass over time. But I'm not just talking about the world, Mary. I'm talking about you as an individual. When I bring my kingdom to you and my life is conceived in you, what is begun by that conception will have no stoppage. But what is set in motion by my life implanted in you, by your consent, will be brought about to fruit. There are two. I think normal responses to that kind of news, one would be excitement and the possibility of life being born in you and growing in you and coming from you and changing the world around you. But if you really heard what was being said, the other legitimate response would be, Fear, why fear? Well, just stick with the pregnancy model. Well, in fact, babies are especially in the length of destiny. Husbands have been with their wives. You've seen the process in the length. Then another one will have. Well, the fact is this, once the process of pregnancy has begun, there are things in you that are going to happen to you physically that you cannot stop. Now, I guess that we know about willful ways that you can stop the process, but you have to intervene. You have to physically reward that which has been conceived. And I think this would be another sermon, but it is possible. And some of you have done it, and some of you are even sad about it, but some of us have, in fact, a warning, words of God, that he has conceived in us and began to grow in us. And we didn't want it, and so it stopped. And you can do that. But if allowed to come to fruit, the work of God conceived in you, that's growing in you, it's going to bring some changes in you and it's just going to happen. You can't stop it. There will be no end to it. And all those changes, again, appealing to this pregnancy dynamic, not all of those changes are present. There is the hope of life. There is the anticipation of this baby that's going to be born. That's what kind of keeps you going. But I know very few women who didn't have at least one or two times during the process of their pregnancy come up. Wonder why on earth I ever get sent into this thing in the first place. And you came into the spiritual dynamic. And you are in the middle of a deep work of God in your life. And he's growing you and sprinting you. The promise of life is, I wish I would have never healed it. I wish I would have never repented. I wish I would have never gone with it. Sometimes in the process, it's an incredibly thrilling dynamic, but there is a fear problem. The life that is growing in you will change you, and it will stretch you, and it will mark you. Sometimes it will thrill you, but often it will scare you. I was going to get 20 years ago. Ronnie and I were taking a little walk outside, speaking very fast. My wife was very, very pregnant with our first child on the rail. And we were dying on this. I don't know if this is popular or not, but we were doing those Hamas classes. And they were all great. And we were getting, and they still are. But my wife got me to go by telling me that it had to be a car recently. And we had just seen this film about women who had been repositing blood to their child. And it was a life of a woman who had been repositing. My wife was so frightened by that. I didn't realize it was a woman. Talked about how frightened she was and how she was. It's like, let's show it. I do this. Now it's a great comfort. It's a great comfort. In fact, I was. I really am good at a moment like that. I just go around and I said, I need to go to this. I need to go to this. I need to go to this. I need to go to this. Do you know what all this, hopefully I can build this in. Race is a very important question, not as it relates to pregnancy, But as it relates to legitimately the life of God, whether it be a deeper work of God that he has desired to conceive in you and grow in you and issue from you, both it relates simply to your initiation into the kingdom of God. That being the life of God coming to you for the very first time, making you a son or a daughter of his. By virtue of this birth in you, the very appropriate question on the front end of either one of those things is, Do you really want this life? You try so hard to sell people. You're going to make every trip. No, no, no. Just wait. Slow down a bit. You're going to put your toes. Don't jump on this life. Do you really want this life? Let me tell you what it will mean if you're serious. The God of the universe is going to plant inside of you his very seed. And when that life is conceived in you by the Holy Spirit, Just like it was in Mary. This life in you is going to change you. It is going to mark you. It is going to stretch you. It is going to call you. And that work of God in you will never end. Be sure you really want to learn to live. Be sure you really want to learn to walk with God growing inside of you. Isn't that even concept of interesting images? Women are pregnant and the life that's in them begins to grow. And guess what? As that life in them begins to grow, they begin to walk. They don't particularly like the fact that they're walking different, but it's a little more wild than a walk. They start walking different. They get into the spiritual way. God puts his life in you, and that life begins to grow in you. And I'm telling you what, men and women, you have the life of God growing in you. and begin to walk a different way. Walk not as a wise, but as wise. How is that going to happen? There's always happening. Because he will grow with you. He will sometimes consume you. But he will never change you, calm you, stretch you, and take you to death. This is Mary's eventual response as she began to get a picture of what we mean as this all happened in her response. We're going to be the same as many of you. This will be, get, done, and to me, just as she said, let me do it. But before she said that, she still had one more question, one more obstacle, the person that she needed to deal with before she had entered into this and allow this work of God inside of her. Verse 34 is where we see it. And Mary said to the angel, one more question, this is not about the fear. How can this be since I am just a virgin? Now to reframe that so we understand what she's really saying, is what she's saying at this point is this. Now I've heard the promise, angel, of life being conceived in me and growing in me and coming from me. And I'm past the fear. I want it. I really do. I'm just confused. How can this thing be because I'm not qualified? And many a person stops short of the life-giving power of the Spirit coming to them because they feel like they're not qualified. They haven't done what they have to do to get the life of God. And that's exactly what Mary was. Thinking, I have not done what I thought you had to do to get life. This isn't legal. I did not have the necessary experience. She didn't. She was a virgin. Virgins don't have babies. Isn't there something you have to do in the flesh to make this happen? A question, how can this be? Hear not the gospel of God-initiated grace. Verse 35, the angel answered and said to Mary, Mary, you need to understand. This is not something you can't accomplish. It's not something that in the flesh anybody needs to do to make it happen. Here's how it's going to happen. If you will receive this promise, the Holy Spirit will come upon you. The power of the highest will overshadow you. It means to come around you. The word overshadow is interesting. It means to make a tent with you. Take a tent back. You're going through the bottom of the water for a couple of weeks. In those days, people live in a tent. That's where they live. God will live with you, around you, over you, under you and plant His life in you. If you will allow us to appear this way, Mary. If you will receive this life, I will achieve this life. If you will bear this life, I will grow this life. If you will allow this life to come into you, I will complete this life in you. If you make in your mind the translation from Mary's physical perception of this life to our spiritual reception of this life. Dearly beloved in this place, if you will receive the life of God, he will achieve that in you. If you will bear it, he will grow it. If you will allow it, he will complete it. But make no mistake before you go, yeah, yeah, yeah. If you receive this life by faith, there will be no stoppage. There will be no end. The life of God, the secret in you will grow in you and crush you and stretch you and sometimes scare you and mark you and thrill you. I will cause you to walk like a pregnant woman. I will cause you to walk like someone who has the life of God. There is response. Let it be done. Let it be. That's what I want. I receive this. Come into me and grow in me and manifest your life. Here's God promise. That desire to that request. Whenever he hears it, whenever he hears it, verse 35, the Holy Spirit will come up on you. The power of the highest will ever shadow you. So that the Holy One of God, so that the Holy Son of God can be born. And you will let him go and come from you and change the world around you. And some of your spirits will come from you. I say, let it be, God, just like you see. You wonder, in this room right now, my name, and let us do something else, and it's sponsored very straight from the public. It's a new story, but it's a new story. It's true. I believe in the first year, I believe in the first year, my pride in the day. Listen to that, right? We know we're going to run you before we get to the most of us in your head. We're going to take you. We're going to take you before we do one other thing. The Holy Spirit will come upon you. The Father, the highest will come around you. The life of God will be conceived in you. Will be growing in you. Will manifest through you and change the world. We're going to be. That's what it does. Four years ago, when I originally shared this word, he was going to take us out of this common Christian week. We can hear it today. We'll hear it. Some of that is wrong. Today, I'll be here for Christmas. We're not just going to be here. It's all over the same Christmas. It's going to be our life. We're going to take up a bit of that. Well, it's just teaching. And I'm just going to resurrect you now with this. I'm going to marry you. And I'm going to marry you. Which means this. What I wish for you, what I'm blessing you with is this. My desire for you is this. That you have a Christ conceived in you. A Christ coming alive in you. Christmas. More than that, my wish for you is that you would this Christmas have a Christ growing in you. Christmas. A Christ coming from you. Manifesting out of you. Christmas, changing the world around you. Christmas. What a wonderful thought. That's landing in our hearts as we go to the table. The table, in my mind, connected to the story, allows us to experience kind of a full cycle because of the death and the resurrection of Christ. It makes possible the fact that out of his resurrected life, he can, by his spirit, turn around and then plant his very life Back into me. Mary being the first. To whom the life came. In whom the life grew. From whom the life came. Affecting the world around us. And that physical Jesus. The embodiment of God himself. He died. Wrote again. By his spirit. To men and women. Ever since then. Who was saved. Let it be done to me. Just as he said. Just as it happened to Mary. Let it be done to me. His spirit. Comes upon them. And gives them life. What an incredible celebration. We're going to do the table this week. Let me pray for you. Father, in Jesus' name, we pray for the saints. Father, we believe that you are present in our worship. Thank you. It reminds us of that incredible event, that regenerative event of your death, your resurrection, that made it possible for us to even say, let it be unto us, just as you said, so that your life could be conceived in us. What a thought, your life, conceived in us, as it gets to be grown in us and come from us and change the world around us. Let it be done. Let it be done. Let it be done. Let it be done. Thank you.
