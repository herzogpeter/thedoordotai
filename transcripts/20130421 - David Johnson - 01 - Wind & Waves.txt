As they, Peter and John, were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees came up to them, being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. And they laid hands on them and put them in jail until the next day, for it was already evening. But many of those who had heard the message believed, and the number of the men came to be about five thousand. On the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem, and Ones the high priest was there and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all who were of high priestly descent. When they had placed them in the center, they began to inquire, by what power and what name have you done this? In other words, who do you think you are? When they had threatened them further, they let them go, finding no basis on which to punish them on account of the people because they were all glorifying God for what had happened. This is the word of the Lord. So trouble is brewing in the text that Dre just read, chapter 4, verses 1 through 7, just kind of moving into this next section of Acts. They let him go, that is Peter and John, but only because the people who were quite enamored at the time with all of these events of Pentecost that began in Acts chapter 2, because since Acts chapter 2, since these events of Pentecost in Jerusalem, they were all, according to Acts 4 that Dre just read, they were all this crowd glorifying God for what was happening. But crowds are fickle. They can easily be turned. There was a crowd, actually, in Matthew 21 that cried, Hosanna, as Jesus came into Jerusalem that day. That same crowd, a few days later, was crying, crucify him, so we'll bide our time and let this play out, thought the officials of the court in Jerusalem in Acts chapter 4, which they did, bide their time. They let them go, finding nothing to accuse them of, but particularly the crowd was too much with them to do anything now, so they waited until chapter 5 verse 17, which isn't very long, 17 verses later, when the same group of people, these Sadducees, these high priests, struck again as the high priest rose up again, along with all his associates, that is the sect of the Sadducees again. Here they are again, and they were filled with jealousy. Why? Well, obviously why? Because they were losing the people to these guys, and if we lose the people to them, we lose our power, our authority. So they laid hands on them again and put them in public jail again. And so it begins. What it is that is beginning here in Acts chapter 4 is a pattern. It is a theme that is going to continue to manifest itself in a variety of ways all through the book of Acts. And the pattern or the theme is this, that whenever and wherever the wind of God's Spirit authentically begins to blow, sometimes with a gentle breeze, but that breeze begins to turn into a wind and blow even harder. Whenever and wherever the wind of God's Spirit begins to authentically blow, waves of resistance inevitably will begin to stir waves that sometimes look like they could actually capsize your boat. we could go down with this wave, and sometimes you do go down with the boats, because the apostles didn't always get set free from prison. In chapter 4, they get set free. They are released, but that wasn't always the case. Chapter 4, they get set free. You're out of prison. Chapter 7, not much longer from chapter 4. Stephen doesn't get set free from prison. In chapter 7, Stephen gets stoned in chapter 12. James is beheaded. Paul eventually is too. And Peter, who is the kind of key player here in Acts chapter 2, would one day be crucified, according to legend, crucified upside down, which means, among other things, this, that boats get capsized. Boats get capsized. And when they do, it sometimes makes us wonder, especially if we're kind of doing a God thing. If the boat gets capsized and we somehow go down, it starts making you wonder, is God still with us? It kind of makes you wonder if we've maybe done something wrong, because we tend to believe. And you don't find out you believe this until something gets capsized, and we're just all confused, because we do tend to believe that if we do it right, if we do it well, if we kind of even do the God thing, there will be no waves, no worries, no trouble, no pain, when in point of fact. Sometimes the opposite is true, because sometimes the waves, the trouble, the conflict, the pain, are actually a direct result of the wind that began to blow when you began to move into what God was telling you to move into, when you began to speak to what God was telling you to speak to, when you began to break maybe the silence, and God began to move, but whoa, there's other things started happening too that wasn't very pleasant. I like the God-moving thing, but here's the deal. You need to know whenever and wherever the wind of God's Spirit authentically begins to blow I promise you waves of resistance inevitably begin to stir in few places. Make what I'm talking about here more clear than this section of scripture that we're in right now. So let me remind you of where we are in the story because when I kind of tell you about the whole story that we've been in in the book of Acts, it kind of helps you see this dynamic that I think is inevitable because in Acts chapter 2, the clothing with power that Jesus had referred to as the promise of the Father had arrived in Acts chapter 2 in the form of the Holy Spirit. The waiting is over. It's finally here indeed. It wasn't just an arrival. It was a baptism of the Spirit. We were immersed into the fullness of God's Spirit so that now under the influence of the Spirit, even people like Peter, who was so wobbly in his faith. Remember that? Just as Jesus was being crucified, Peter, I never knew you. Some preacher you. Here, Peter preaches under the influence of the Spirit with an authority and a boldness that he previously had not had, and his preaching had an effect, because in Acts chapter 2, it says that what he said pierced the hearts of those who were listening, and it pierced their hearts in such a way that 3,000 souls came to faith in that one day, and everyone, It says in Acts chapter 2, verse 42, kept feeling this sense of awe. This is awesome. What a great church. This is awesome. It's day by day. The Lord was adding to their number those who were being saved. And then in chapter 3, it just keeps going. It just keeps growing. Momentum is building. Love to be part of that stuff. When Peter and John healed the lame beggar. Remember this? At the gates of the temple, saying simply this, as this beggar was begging alms, they saw him and said, don't have any of that. Silver and gold have I none, but what I have I'll give to you in the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene. Rise and walk. And he did. And when he did, the people saw. And when they saw, a crowd gathered. And when the crowd gathered, okay, I'm on again. Peter took his stand once again and began to preach. The second Christian sermon ever preached. And when he preached, more believed. 5,000 this time, almost double that of Pentecost when 3,000 believed. We're on a roll here, folks. Because the wind of God's Spirit is blowing. The gifts of God's Spirit are flowing in truly amazing ways beyond our wildest dream ways. When in chapter 4, verse 1, some waves appear. Some resistance arrives because you just can't have this much wind without some waves. Indeed, they come together. They are, in fact, a matched set. Now, compared to what the church, Peter and John and other apostles as well, but all, just the whole church, compared to what they would ultimately be called to face in later chapters in the book of Acts, this episode in Acts chapter 4 is relatively minor. But where we are in the story makes it significant and in fact makes it, I think, big because this resistance that they're getting is actually the first resistance that they're experiencing. And they received resistance when they were with Jesus, but if you kind of dial into what they had to actually feel like when Jesus in his ministry, when they were with him was being resisted. They were scared and it affected them, but they kind of weren't bearing the brunt of it. Jesus kind of did, even right up to his crucifixion. Jesus kind of did all that. And we were kind of watching in part of it and scared, but now there's nobody between them. They have the fullness of the Spirit. That's incredible, but it's just them now. So this is their first direct assault, if you will, on them. So this first one's a big one, and putting it in context, I think, helps you empathize with them a little bit as well, and even understand what's going on, because for three chapters, it's been nothing but wind. And wow, this is awesome. And when you're in a role like that, you kind of just go, this is incredible, and you kind of get this sense, we finally got it right. But now chapter 4, verse 1, first wave isn't wow, it's whoa, oh, this is scary. Which is precisely why early on in our journey as a church through the book of Acts, I want us to kind of stop and notice what's going on here. I want us to see and understand as best we can this reality of life in the kingdom of God. And the reality of which I speak is this. It's just the way it is in life, particularly life in the kingdom of God, that right along with all the good stuff that is part of any authentic movement of God's spirit, that sense of presence and power that we so love and cherish, that sense of wonder as well, where we're realizing that we're actually part of something God is doing. I don't mean I realize I'm part of a big church where there's lots of activity. That's fine. No, every once in a while you realize I'm part of something God is doing. This is the wind of God's Spirit. Whenever you're in something like that, you need to know that right in the middle, right mixed into the soup, if you will, of that experience is trouble, tension, conflict, and sometimes what actually looks like defeat, even a kind of death, because with the wind comes waves. You can't have one without the other, because the wind and the waves are a matched set. Consider now Peter and John, who in chapter 4, verse 3, are thrown in prison. They're thrown in prison right in the middle of all sorts of wonderful things happening. The lame man had just been healed, and now they're thrown in prison. And in verse 7, are standing in the center of the council. And being in the center of the council is very intentional. I mean, picture that. You're in the center. You're surrounded by some very scary people. It's designed to intimidate, and it did intimidate before the rulers, were they? All around them were the rulers and the elders and the scribes, and it's the high priest and Caiaphas, too, who just happened to be the very same people, which is something that adds to the intimidation. They're the very same people who, in a very similar setting, found Jesus to be worthy of death. So the trouble therein as they stand in the center of this council is real. They are in real trouble with reason to be afraid. But actually, the part of this scene that I want us to kind of dial into and notice, because it's something I think we need to notice relative to actual life in the kingdom of God is this irony. And the irony is this, that it's right in the middle of some amazing things that are happening, that some very disturbing and frightening things are happening as well. Indeed, on what could arguably be called some of the best days of ministry life for Peter and John. And I kind of do have in mind the ministry days they had with Jesus, which were amazing. And they had amazing ministry experiences with Jesus. But again, when they were with Jesus, Jesus was kind of, I don't want to make this sound crass, but he was kind of the show. He was kind of the guy. Now it's them again. in what could arguably be called some of their greatest days of ministry success, starting with this baptism of the Spirit, power to preach that wasn't there before, thousands being saved, a lame man walks, and everyone is feeling this sense of awe that right in the middle, this is the irony of experiencing some of their best days, they begin to experience some of their worst days, and their best day, and their worst day was the same day, which is confusing. What's going on? Is this good? Is this bad? What is all this? Because it was on the same day. It was on the same day that Peter and John had healed this lame man at the gate, beautiful, that the priests, it says in Acts 4, verse 1, the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees as well, came upon them being greatly disturbed because of what they were teaching. So they laid hands on them, that is, Peter and John, and I'm sure they did it quite gently. Please lower your head as you get into the chariot. Very nice. And put them in jail to the next day. So they're having a really good day where thousands believe a lame man walks and a really bad day on kind of the same day. Indeed, the flow of the text is fascinating to me. in chapter 4 captures, I think, what I'm trying to say here quite well. We were going to put it on screen, but you really can't get it. When I looked in my Bible, there was verse 3, verse 4, verse 5. Verse 3, thrown in jail. Bad day. Verse 4, fascinating. Kind of a good day, because it says many of those, very next verse, thrown in jail, verse 5, many of those who heard Peter's message believed 5,000 in all. Good day! Celebrate day! On the same day, they got thrown in jail, verse 3, verse 4, good day, bad day, or bad day, good day. And then in verse 5, after they find out, or these 5,000 are saved, they're standing in the center of the council, a council that can do them great harm. So right there, verse 3, bad day. Verse 4, good day. Verse 5, bad day. Same day. What's going on here? What is this? When I think of that, I think of one of the questions we commonly ask when we have elder meetings. Sometimes our executive team meeting as well, we just kind of sit back and, actually, this is kind of a routine question. Where's the wind blowing? What are we hearing from the prophets? What are we hearing from our intercessors? What are we hearing from various ministries? Where's the wind blowing? Where's God moving? And we get reported. And there's this, yeah, it's going over here. But we don't ask for where are the waves kicking? We hear about that. But there's this and there's that. And I don't know. And I don't know what that even means. Maybe that's not even God. Maybe this is a bad thing. And on and on and on. You go. And I'm just telling you. I'm telling you, this is about life in the kingdom of God. When God is moving, waves come. You can't separate them. And I don't know how to prepare you for that. Except to tell you that whenever and wherever the wind of God's spirit authentically begins to blow, waves of resistance inevitably will begin to stir. And when they do, and they will, in our church, in your life, we need to know that it's not because God's abandoned us that you're facing waves right now, and it's not because you did it wrong necessarily, because sometimes you did do it wrong, and that's the wave you're facing. But actually, when you did do it wrong, and that's the consequence you're facing, I don't want to minimize how scary that stuff is. It's actually somewhat easier to handle because you can go, sorry. No, I'm really sorry. I really am. We did it wrong. And I don't know. I don't know. I might get sound simple, but I think you know what I mean. All of a sudden, okay, okay, comes down. But sometimes the waves, sometimes the waves are because you did it right. See, we need to know that sometimes the turmoil you sense, we sense, that sometimes the trouble you're in, that sometimes the conflict you feel is sometimes because you finally actually didn't do it wrong. You finally actually did it right. You finally entered into something of substance, actually, in your life, in your marriage, in your conversation. You entered into something deep and real, substantial, because finally you told the truth. You quit pretending. You quit denying. And you finally brought out into the light what you've been hiding in the dark about what's going on inside of your soul, inside of your marriage, your family, the church, Whatever. And when you do that, when you finally speak truth, when you finally shed light, I'm telling you, that's God stuff. And life will come from that. But mixed into the life will be things that feel like I'm going to die. I hate that. A few weeks ago, you may recall, we were talking about the gifts of the Spirit. And the reason we were talking about the gifts of the Spirit because we were in Acts 3, verse 1, where Peter and John healed the lame beggar by the gate of the temple. And that miracle kind of put on display the gifts of the Spirit. There was the gifts of knowledge. I mean, remember that? How did he pick this guy? He saw this guy every day. Why did he stop today? A gift of knowledge. There was a word from the Spirit of God to those guys to say, this guy, this day, do something. There were gifts of healing, obviously, the gifts of faith, the effecting of miracles. And so we use that as a time to kind of back up, create a foundation for an understanding of the gifts of the Spirit so we could go on through the book of the Acts. And among the things I said a few weeks ago about the gifts of the Spirit was this, that we need to remember our open door, that the gifts of the Spirit are rooted in a promise. And the promise is this, from Jesus to Peter, in Matthew 16, verse 18, Jesus says this, Peter, you need to know I will build my church. And even the gates of hell will not prevail against that church that is empowered by the Spirit and moving in the gifts of the Spirit as it moves against the gates of hell. Those gates will not prevail against this church. But in connecting that promise of Jesus to the church, to the gifts of the Spirit, I paraphrase that verse this way, saying it this way, that I will, says Jesus, build my church. And what I mean by that relative to the gifts is this, that I will get to my people what they need, when they need it, in order to storm the gates of hell. And what you need when you do that, when you storm the gates of hell, which sounds so bizarre, let's storm the gates of hell. Whatever that means, let's go there. It means this, whenever you go toward those dark, desperate, and even dead places. Forget the world right now. Whenever you go toward the dark, desperate, and dead places in your own, oh yeah, it's you and me, your own spirit, and in your own marriage and family and church, and maybe then community, we'll worry about the world someday. Let's do us. You go toward those dark, desperate, dead places that you've kind of not wanted to go toward because you know what's going to happen. One thing is life will happen, but waves might kick up as, well, you go toward those dark places. What you're going to need is supernatural manifestations of the Spirit's gifts of wisdom and discernment, words of knowledge as well, gifts of healing and faith, prophecy and deliverance, affecting miracles to which, if I'm right about that relative to the gifts, provides what I think is a very important clue as how we can begin as a people, individuals and as a church, to actually experience the gifts of the Spirit because it's something we're very interested in. Everybody seems very interested. How are we going to do that? Here's how. Quit trying to get the gifts to happen and actually attempt something that might require them. In other words, when you experience the gifts of the Spirit, supernatural power of God, begin to move toward those dark places, desperate and dead places, first of all, in your own soul and in your own marriage and family and in our church and community. And dare to pray, Holy Spirit, come into all of that. Shine a light on that. But when you do, first thing that will happen is this. All hell will break loose. But heaven too. And life too. An eternal kind of life too. Because here's the deal. You can't have one without the other. They're a match set because whenever and wherever the wind of God's Spirit authentically begins to blow, waves, resistance inevitably begin to stir. But there's more. And here's the more. Because if the wind of God's Spirit continues to blow, say it starts with a breeze, we're experiencing some good things. Wow, this is good. Yeah, there's some resistance. Yeah, it was a little scary, but if that wind continues to blow, can stay in with the analogy. If the wind actually picks up a little bit, so will the waves. Which means, among other things, this really good news here. The more God moves, which is what we want, yes, God, the more God moves, the bigger the waves, so it might not get easier the longer we go, Which raises a question. It's the question of the day. So do you still want the wind? Are you sure? See, in Acts chapter 4, the first wave of resistance was scary. It was scary, but nothing much happened, actually. I mean, particularly compared to what was to come. They were threatened. They were confronted. They were put in prison. And then they were released. Okay, really scary. but one chapter later one chapter later in Acts chapter 5 the 40th verse they were brought in this time and this time they were flogged and that wasn't pleasant no shirt on rips your back to shreds and after they were flogged they were ordered to speak no more in the name of Jesus so the purpose of the flogging was to punish them but it was also to warn them you do it again more of that is waiting for you but every day it says in verse 42 of Acts chapter 5 in the temple and from house to house, they kept on talking. They kept on moving toward the dark places, preaching and teaching. Jesus is the Christ. And the Word of God, it says in Acts 6-7, kept on spreading. And the number of disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem. And even a great number of priests. Are you kidding? Priests who were opposing them were beginning to become obedient to the faith. So what we've got here is the wind of God's Spirit it, continuing to blow. Indeed, the wind is picking up. When in chapter 6, Stephen, right in the middle of all this good stuff happening, wind blowing, it says Stephen in verse 5 of chapter 6, a man full of faith and full of the Holy Spirit, stood up to preach under the influence of the Holy Spirit, just like Peter did in Acts chapter 2 and Acts chapter 3. and when he did, that is Stephen, they were cut to the quick. They were pierced to the heart, just like they were when Peter preached, only this time they didn't repent and believe the way they did when Peter preached. This time when Stephen preached under the influence of the Spirit and they were pierced to the heart, it says they began gnashing their teeth at him. They hated him. And so in verse 57, they cried out with a loud voice, covered their ears, rushed upon him with one impulse, drove him out of the city and began stoning him until he was dead. It kind of capsized his boat. All of which sounds, oh, extreme. A little bizarre. You know, we read those stories. Yes, in the Bible. Wow, these crazy stories. But honestly, sitting in my office, can't quite relate. As to how that scene might look today with us, or how it might look to me, can't quite relate, except I can, a little. And so can you, I think. I have a pastor friend who lives in Texas. at least he used to live in Texas, who years ago, pastor of this little Baptist church is what it was at the time in this small Texas town, began to preach a message that went beneath the surface of what I would call religious propriety, where I was just kind of here being good Baptist people. And he started going a little bit deeper to get into the things that needed to be revealed and exposed so life could come. And this message that God had put in him pierced the hearts of many. Not only in that church, but in that town as God began authentically to move and to heal and to restore and to expose and to bring life. But with the wind comes the waves. Because while some in that small Texas town were doing Acts 4, like the crowd was doing in those days, glorifying God because we're coming to life, Others in that town, actually it was others in that small Baptist church, became quite uncomfortable with what was going on. And we could kind of try to figure out all sorts of reasons why they would be uncomfortable. But my theory on this, because it always happens this way when religion kind of gets involved in this, here's why they were uncomfortable. Because the life that was, the authentic life that was actually beginning to emerge all around them in this church, and then in this town made their lack of life look as lacking in life as it actually was. You follow that? See, if everything is dead, it's just whatever it looks like. It might look dead, but at least it looks normal. We're all dead. We're fine. And then in the middle of something dead, something green comes, and all of a sudden the thing that has life makes everything that's dead look as pathetic as it actually is. And there's some waves that come from that, some anger that rises in that because they get exposed, which is exactly what's happening in Acts chapter 4, and Acts chapter 5, and 6, and 7. We're going to see this played out all through this study in Acts. Indeed, in Acts 5.17, it says that the high priest rose up with all his associates, that is the sect of the Sadducees, and they were filled with what? Jealousy. Why? I just told you why. Here's why. Because the authority, authenticity, power, and life that was so obvious in Peter and John and flowing from Peter and John made the lack of authority, authenticity, power, and life that was in these other people look as lacking in authority, power, authenticity, and life as it actually was. so they cried out with a loud voice. And now I'm back in that small town in Texas where they cried out with a loud voice and covered their ears and then figured out a way through a series actually of meetings behind the scenes. We actually do care about him. And they figured out a way to rush upon him with one impulse. And they actually did it at a business meeting. Praise Jesus for those. And they drove him out of that church and eventually out of that town. And he's fine, by the way. But it was stoning. Kind of. Back to Stephen. Chapter 7, verse 55. And being full of the Holy Spirit. And this is great, because this is where he's being stoned. He is about to die. About to die. I'd want to go this way. I'd want to go this way. full of the Holy Spirit. Stephen gazed intently into heaven and full of the Spirit in the moment of his death, at the moment of truth, he gets a gift. Because here's what he sees, the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father. Standing, Jesus, is at the right hand of the Father. Jesus standing is notable. Because most of the text that we have Jesus referred to as being at the right hand of the Father, He's almost always seated at the right hand of the Father. The right hand being the place of authority and honor. But in almost every text, He is seated at the right hand of the Father. And the reason Jesus most of the time in these kind of visions, these symbolic pictures, the reason He's seated at the right hand of the Father is because when it comes to our redemption, the work is done. Forgiveness, done. Reconciliation complete. Work over. I'm sitting down. True. Hebrews 10 verse 12 says this. But he, that is Jesus, having offered one sacrifice for all sins, for all time, sat down. Ha ha. The right hand of the Father, because I'm done. You're forgiven. You're reconciled. Done deal. But when one of his children is beginning to pay a price for what is right and good and noble and true, our great high priest, seated at the right hand of the Father, stands up at the right hand of the Father, as if to say, among other things, this. Stephen, in this moment of truth, full of spirit, you're about to die. You need to know right now you have not been abandoned. And this is not happening to you right now because you did it wrong. This is not happening to you because you didn't preach as good as Peter. Peter preached, pierced their hearts, people got saved. You preached, pierced their hearts, you die. This isn't because you did it wrong, it's because you did it right. So you need to quit believing. that if you do it right, and if you say it right, and maybe say it nice, there'll be no waves. There'll be no resistance, no trouble, no pain. Because the truth is this, and I don't know how to prepare you for this except to tell you this, that most of the time, quite the opposite is true. Because whenever and wherever the wind of God's Spirit authentically begins to blow, winds of resistance inevitably begin to stir, all of which raises this question again, the question with which I now close. So do you still want the wind? Because in chapters 1 through 3, the answer is yes, yes, absolutely. Give me the baptism, the filling, the healing. Give me that success. 5,000 one day. Please. that sense of awe I love that stuff but now I'm not so sure because the truth is this at the end of the day when everything is measured out not everybody does want the wind in fact for most I don't know maybe it's not most maybe it's many I think it's most as I move beyond us to just the church whatever I just think that for most A little religion Do it just fine I'm serious, come to church, sing some songs Warm my heart, I like that Quite satisfied Are most, I think To be warmed by the fire But never really get in The fire Where they might just be transformed By the fire But it's going to burn Might be transformed actually into fire so demanding to be served they never serve demanding to be healed and be part of a church that heals they never heal anyone else demanding to be forgiven never forgive demanding to be loved they never love they never move toward the dark desperate and dead places in their own soul or spirit or in their own marriage or family or life or church or dare to pray, Holy Spirit, come into all of that. Shine a light on that because if you pray like that, all hell will break loose. But so does heaven and so does life. but it's an eternal kind of life. So what do you want? Do you still want the wind, even though there will be waves? Well, as it turns out, some people do. I know I'm looking at some of them right here. This journey we've been on for all these years, and you keep coming back and staying in it. People who like Peter, I love this. When facing the kind of trouble that could capsize his boat, that one day would capsize his boat, being crucified himself, one day. Peter in Acts 4.19, and please dial in, so Acts 4.19, we're still in this incident where he's being threatened, and it hasn't really gotten scarier, but he's being really threatened. Peter, who in Acts 4.19 says this to this group of very scary people in the center of the council, says this to them, whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God. You be the judge. Here's what I know. Here's what I choose. We cannot stop speaking of those things that we have seen and we have heard. There's just too much life here to care about. Even death. Give me the wind, even if it brings the waves. People like that change the world. People like that did change the world. Peter, John, others, some of you. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. I want to be that kind of person. and I think you want to be that kind of people. Would you stand with me as we close in prayer? The prayer team will be here, as they always are every Sunday after church, to receive any of you for prayer. There's two things I have in mind relative to prayer. One is for those of you facing waves that already are capsizing your boat in one way or another. I mean, you feel like you're going down. And maybe the waves aren't because you did it right. Maybe they're because you did it wrong. Regardless, your boat's capsized right here, right now. Come for prayer, would you? Another person, kind of person, I have in my mind is for those who've lost their want to want the wind. Because maybe they've had too much of the waves. It's just too much. I'm going to back off. I'm going to ease off. And so you've just kind of lost your want to even want the wind or even believe that it's real. And some of you might be saying, I want my want back. Come for prayer. And so we pray, Father, in the name of Jesus, send your spirit. I want you to listen to what I just said. Father, in the name of Jesus, send your spirit. Trinity, fullness of God, come here right now and send your spirits with all your gifts of the Spirit to give your people what we need when we need it right now, right here. Some whose boats are being capsized, who've even lost their hope, who've lost their wants, and they want it back. For things I can't even name right now that we need and can only get from you, we pray. In Jesus' name, we pray. In Jesus' name, we pray. And all God's people said, amen. Thank you.
