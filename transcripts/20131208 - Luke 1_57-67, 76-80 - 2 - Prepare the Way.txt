Music Music Music Music Music Music Hello, we are the Steiners family. My name is Jacob. I'm Sherry. I'm Griffin. I'm Anne. And I'm Brian. Today's scripture reading is taken from Luke 157 and 76 through 80. Now the time had come for Elizabeth to give birth, and she brought forth a son. His name was John. Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had displayed his great mercy toward her, and they were rejoicing with her. And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying, You, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High, for you will go on before the Lord to prepare his ways, to shine upon those who sit in darkness in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. And the child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit. And he lived in the deserts until the day of his public appearance to Israel. An appearance that finally came about in chapter 3, verse 1. When in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ichiraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene, in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. And he came into all the district around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. His name is John the Baptist. That's who they were talking about I think you figured that out As it went through the text As they went through the text His name wasn't mentioned But it's John the Baptist And in all four of the Gospels He's described in this way Quoting the prophet Isaiah As being a voice Crying in the wilderness Sounds kind of like a lonely thing Sounds maybe like a confusing thing A voice crying in the wilderness And his message among other things with this kind of comes down to this prepare you need to get ready prepare the way make straight the paths get ready for the coming of the king for the coming of the king who actually is the light of the world and the reason you need to get ready is because you don't want to miss it um so the question of the day i was up here talking about these questions of advent the question this week, you can write your response in the post outside or in the gathering place, is this, how are you preparing? What things might you need to prepare for the coming of Christ in this Advent season to you? And one of the spins we kind of have on that is, part of the reason we need to prepare is because he comes in unexpected ways. So we need to pay attention. And so that's the question for this week. It actually happens a lot this time of year, this kind of Christmas time of year. You've invited some friends to be in your home to share a meal, to enjoy conversation. It's easy with friends, with people you love and who love you too, but even with friends who are coming for dinner around Christmas time, you prepare. You get ready. You make sure that things are right and things are ready, not to put on airs or to make an impression, because there's no need for that. The people coming this time are friends. But because they're friends and friends who you love, you want it to be right and easy and warm and this time even special, because it's Christmas, so let's kind of do something a little special. So you get ready. You prepare some food. You make a meal, you clean the house, you pick up your stuff, you get rid of the clutter. I hear things like this when we're picking up the clutter in my house. You're not going to leave that there, are you, Dave? I don't even see what she was talking about. So you put on some music. You might light some candles. If you're in my house, you light candles. Might build a fire, pour some wine. The welcome is warm when they come to the door. The conversation is sweet. The evening is easy. It's easy with friends. But even with friends, you prepare. You get ready. You make a meal and you clean the house. You create the kind of space where that easy thing might actually happen. Because if there's clutter everywhere, your friends would fall over it and ruin the easy part. Ruth Ailey Barton, in her Advent reflections that I've been kind of going through. A number of us have been following that for Advent. It refers to the kind of thing I just described where you invite people over and it's an easy thing but you still prepare. But it's an exciting, fun thing. She compares that to actually being the spirit of Advent. The spirit of Advent marked by, among other things, what Ruth refers to as sweet longings. And when you feel sweet longings, you've entered into the spirit of Advent. And sometimes the sweet longings are touched in very human ways when you're inviting friends for dinner or maybe thinking of people you haven't seen for a long time, and you have these sweet longings. And we don't often attach those very human feelings to really deeply spiritual things, but you're touching, you're tasting the spirit of Advent. But the longing of Advent is a longing for more than even what it feels like when you're longing to see friends. It's a longing for life and for light, even a kind of life and light you can't quite describe. It's a longing for more. Indeed, the spirit of Advent has really been captured. In other words, you're kind of in Advent spirit when you find yourself, for whatever it is, hopefully waiting. And you may be hopefully waiting. And the story I just gave you at the beginning, this illustration of having people come over, you may be hopefully waiting for someone who maybe you haven't seen for a very long time that you love very dearly and you know they're coming. So the waiting for them is a hopeful thing. You're eagerly expecting, you're intentionally preparing, even if it's just for friends that you're having for dinner. Even if it's that, what you're getting is a taste, says Ruth, of advent when you eagerly wait and intentionally prepare but john uh said it this way in the text that the steiners just read make ready the way make straight the path you need to prepare so prepare ye the way um but not anxiously prepare you know what that feels like when you're anxiously preparing. It's because you think you're going to fail or you're afraid it won't be good. That's not the spirit of Advent. If you're in that, you're going to, okay, I'm not in Advent right now because I'm all worried. Okay, that's not the Advent spirit because the Advent spirit is to hopefully, expectantly, eagerly, intentionally prepare. Like when friends are coming, you haven't seen and you can't wait to see them and you know they're going to come any minute. So you get ready and you're prepared. You remove the obstacles. You change your schedule because if they come now, I'm going to change. I'm going to move these things around and create the space because your friends are coming because the king is coming and the king is the light of the world. I want to create some space. It's called the spirit of Advent. That's what Ruth called it. the spirit of Advent, and you don't want to miss it, because you can miss it. And we do miss it. In fact, in Jesus' day, lots of people missed it. The light appeared. John's gospel says this crazy, interesting thing. The judgment has come, that the light has come. We know the light has come, but the world didn't see it. And he came unto his own, and his own received him not. So it's possible for the light to come and not see it, which is at least part of why Steve talked about what he talked about when he talked last week about two things that are real consistent with Advent and kind of necessary around Advent. He talked, first of all, about the posture of Advent and the practice of Advent. The posture of Advent is the posture of waiting, which can sound very passive. I'm just sitting here waiting, twiddling my thumbs. His point was, however, this, and very important that this waiting was an alert kind of waiting. It's an awake kind of waiting where your antenna is up, as it were, to what God may be doing because you don't want to miss it. And particularly what you don't want to miss are the unexpected ways that God may show up in this Advent season because he always seems to show up in some unexpected ways. Steve suggested looking for ordinary ways and ordinary people that Christ may be coming to us through them, that his light may be shining on us through these unexpected things. But to see all that, you need the right posture. And then he talked about the right practice. Steve gave us two practices. The first was this, you need to show up. You need to show up, and then you need to look up. And he used Simeon. Remember this in Luke chapter 2. Simeon who was in the temple as was his practice. Which means he showed up every day. But he also looked up. Which is the second practice that Steve suggested. Because he was looking it says in Luke chapter 2 verse 25. For the consolation of Israel. And the consolation of Israel is weird language. What he was looking for. What he was attentive to. Looking up about and showing up every day. Anticipating was the coming of the Christ, and that looking and that showing up all the time speaks to an alertness, because he wasn't just looking, he was paying attention. His antenna, as it were, was up. He was showing up. He was looking up, so as not to miss, particularly the unexpected ways that the Christ may be coming. And then, there they were. I mean, talk about unexpected. This young girl, 14, 15 years old, this young man, Joseph and Mary, they weren't even married. Two little turtle doves they were bringing as the offering for the circumcision and the dedication to God of their child. I mean, what could have been more poverty? Weak? This is wrong. There they were. He's Christ. This is it because he saw. He showed up. He looked up, and when he did, Esau. Indeed, in the Advent text that you just heard, some of the same dynamic of unexpectedness is in there as well. When in Luke 3 verse 1, it says this weird thing. You might not have even noticed it. I noticed it. I noticed weird things, though. It says this, that it was in the year, the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar when Pontius Pilate was the governor of Judah, and Herod was Tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was Tetrarch of the region of Itchuria and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene and the priesthood of Ennis and Caiaphas. It was in that time that the word of the Lord came to John, the son of Zechariah, which raises this question, at least it does for me. Why did he do that? Why did he say it that way? Why did he list all of those names and all of those people before he said that the word of the Lord came to John? Here's why I think, and it really does tie into this Advent thing of God showing up in unexpected ways, and ways you'll miss if you're not paying attention, because in verse 1 and 2, Luke here is very intentionally, I think, identifying all of the powers and all of the rulers in all of the kingdoms of all of the world. But the word of the Lord didn't come to them, is Luke's very intentional point here. The word of the Lord did not come to Caesar. He would have expected that. Want to get this word out? gave it to Caesar, didn't come to Herod or Herod's brother Philip, who was, by the way, the tetrarch of Ichabri, who cares, didn't come to Pilate or Annas or Caiaphas, who were in the high priesthood at the time, which means it didn't come to all the people who had all the power and all the status and all the kingdoms of all the world. Instead, it came to the most unlikely person to this untitled, unwashed, rag-wearing, locust-eating hermit in the desert. His name was John. They called him John the Baptist, who, at least at the beginning of the story, a few people noticed him as being special. This little baby leapt in his mother's womb. Some people who were close said, something's going on here, pretty special. Most people did not notice anything special. You never would have noticed if you didn't look up in order to see that the Christ may be coming somehow through this sky in an unexpected way. They called him the baptizer because he baptized people. It was a ministry, a baptism of repentance. Some thought he was a prophet, maybe even Elijah, because when the crowds began to come, the sky was really something special. Now we noticed the special. Now some actually thought he was the Christ, the Messiah, and he came preaching. It says in Luke 3, verse 3, the actual word for preaching there is heralding. He was heralding, and heralding is what heralds do. Because in ancient times, actually, the word herald is significant because in ancient times, a herald was actually a person. They were the hear ye, hear ye kind of person. They were the town criers, the announcers, as it were, whose job it was primarily when a king was coming to town. This is where you'd kind of see them do their job, or someone of royal descent was about to make an entrance into a city or to a town. The herald had responsibility to do two things. One was to announce the coming, which is what John the Baptist is doing. The king is coming. That's what a herald would do. But the second thing, a little less known than the first was this, it was the herald's job to prepare the way, to literally make sure that the physical road that led into the city was clear, so that when the king finally did come with his entourage, he'd have easy access. He'd have a straight shot into the city, which is fascinating when you think about the king coming, the light shining to you and to me. You think about the straight shot. I'd like to him, I'd like God, does he have easy access? Is it easy for him to get into all this in here? So these heralds would prepare the way by removing the obstacles, the physical obstacles that were in the road, obstacles that might slow down the king from getting into the city that might even stop him in some way because sometimes there were boulders in the road and that would stop his entrance. Boulders sometimes fell from above. If there was a cliff, you know, a boulder would fall into the middle of the road. Now we can't get by. But kings often had enemies as well. I mean, you know this is true. Who didn't want the king to come into the city. Because if the king comes into the city, he might win the hearts of people. And we can't have that because I'll lose my power. So the enemies of the king would put boulders in the roads to make it hard for him to enter. They'd set up blockades. They'd cut down trees. Big boulders, as I said, in the road. But sometimes it wasn't that at all. Sometimes what was in the road that needed to be cleared was just clutter. This one works too, I think. Just clutter. The kind of clutter on the road that just accumulates over time. You don't even notice it. People come and go. They drop their stuff. It just stays there. You don't even see it after a while. You just kind of walk around it. You kind of get used to the clutter. And then the king comes. I can't walk. Harold comes. We're cleaning this out. We're cleaning this out because we want to give easy access to the coming of the king. the coming of this light. But now the road has become impassable with all the clutter. And now before you know it, my heart has grown hard. I didn't know when. I didn't know. I don't know how. It's just so full of clutter. I got boulders in the road. If God spoke, I wouldn't hear it. If he came, I wouldn't know it. And it was then. Just in the nick of time, just at the right time, there came this voice crying in the wilderness. Weird voices crying in the wilderness. His name was John. He ate locusts and honey and wore hardly anything, actually. His message was this, time to get ready. It's time to get ready. time to prepare to pick up the clutter, to move the boulders and remove the obstacles so that the king can come, so that the light can shine unobstructed upon those sitting in darkness. So the light can shine upon those sitting in darkness is a phrase that Zacharias used when he was prophesying over this newborn child, this newborn son of his. Remember that, Luke 176? They read it just a few moments ago. Simeon to his son says this, Luke 1, 786. You, child, he's speaking to John the Baptist. You, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High, for you will go on before the Lord to prepare his ways. There's that word, prepare, to give his people the knowledge of salvation by the forgiveness of their sins and to shine upon those, there's the light, who sit in darkness in the shadow of death because he, this king, is the light of the world, and it's going to shine. But if you hope to see it, was his message, because not all do. Some people are blind. You've got to get ready. You've got to prepare because the king is coming. Light is shining, and we need to make the road clear so he has easy access. And so it is. The people came to John. Great numbers of people. They flocked to him in the wilderness, And they came confessing their sin, which is just another way of saying they came saying, I got a boulder, I got a boulder, I got lots of clutter, and I want to get rid of this so I can hear God. Again, so they came and they repented and they confessed, and John washed them clean as if to say in their confessing this stuff is in the way. Got to get rid of this clutter. This boulder has been here all my life, John. With anger, I can't move it anymore. This boulder of bitterness and unforgiveness, I can't move it. But I want to see the light when it comes. I want the king to have access when he comes, access unhindered, so they were getting ready. They were preparing the way. They were lighting the fire, as it were, when you're having company, because it's coming. And they were preparing the meal as if we're eagerly expecting king. He's coming light. He's shining. I love how the apostle John says it. And the apostle John, different than John the Baptist. This is the apostle John. In John 1 verse 6 says it this way there. Came a man from God. Look at it on the screen. John 1 verse 6. A man sent from God. His name was John. I love that. There was a man sent from God. His name was John. He came as a witness to testify about the light. But he was not the light. though some people kind of thought he was the light. They thought he was the Christ. They thought he was Elijah. Rather, he was coming to bear witness to the life or testify to the light. His job was to point. There's the light. It's not me. It's over. There's the light saying there is a true light coming into the world with the capacity to enlighten every man and every woman and every one which sounds like such good news. And it will enlighten everyone to be enlightened. Who wouldn't want to be enlightened? Because no one wants to live in the dark, to be in the dark, to be in the dark ages. When I hear enlightened, I think of enlightenment, and we're all enlightened. And we're so glad we don't live in the dark ages when people didn't know anything. Because no one wants to live in the dark. Because we're enlightened and we love the light, especially at Christmas. We love light because Christmas is all about light and lights and Christmas lights and candle lights and festivals of lights. Let's light a candle. Let's light another candle. Let's build a fire. Let's sing a song about the light. I love those songs about the light. Don't you? Of course you do. So do I, especially at Christmas. But, but, but, but, I'm talking about light. Just make sure you keep the lights a little low. I mean, I'm thinking atmosphere. I want atmosphere. I don't want bright light. I want atmosphere lights. I don't want that much light because too much light would spoil the event. And see a little more than I want to see of, I don't know, you. Or you might see too much of me. Just keep the lights low. I love the light. just keep it low. Because we really don't want to live in the light. Not really. Which is precisely why the apostle John says in chapter 3 of his gospel, still talking about John the Baptist and this light thing, when he says in verse 19 that while the light did in fact come, look at verse 19, he says it this way. This is the judgment. This is the judgment, meaning this is the verdict. After all the evidence of sin, we made a judgment. The light has come into the world. But there was this pesky little problem with the light coming into the world because people actually liked the darkness better than the light. And here's why, because our deeds are evil, which simply means the darkness was just so helpful to hide all that stuff and deeds, says John in verse 20, that everyone who does evil, stop right there, who would that be? Oh, I don't know. All of us? Okay, there we are. Okay. We hate the light. He says we hate the light. Oh, Christmas is the light. We hate the light. And we don't come into the light because we know that in the light our deeds will be seen, exposed. And so we do what we've been doing. We came out of it honestly, what our father and mother did, Adam and Eve in the garden, when sin came they hid and so do we. So we hide and deny, we cover and conceal. We look for shadows and shifting shadows are the best because if they shift, you never quite know what to expect. Is that real? I don't know. What? Because their deeds are evil is why we do that. But then I started thinking, you know what? It's not just because of that. I mean, I get it when I hide things I don't want you to see because I just did something embarrassing or wrong. The other reason I think we hide is because we're scared. and if that's at least part of why it maybe means I need to tell you a little bit more about this light that John is talking about here this light that has come into the world to enlighten every man and I'd like to use actually John's words to tell you a little bit more about the light because when John saw the light says John in verse 14 of John chapter 1 it says this that when the light John 1, 14, or the Word, when the Word or the light actually became flesh, and we could see it, and dwelt among us, we beheld, and what we saw wasn't just light, what we beheld was His glory. And the Word became flesh, the light became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory. Glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of, I know you can see it on the screen, But see, what I was expecting when the light would shine on me and show all my stuff and sin and stuff, I don't want you to say, I thought the light would come and be full of condemnation. But this verse says the light has come and we saw the glory of God and the light was full of, not condemnation, it was full of grace and truth. Verse 16, I love this. Same chapter 1 of John. It says it was grace upon grace. For of his fullness. I love this verse. We have received not condemnation, but grace upon grace. And after that more grace, which means you don't have to be afraid of the light. We talk about being afraid of the dark. The light is what you don't have to be afraid of. Let it shine bright on all your sin. Bring it out here so God can see it, so he can heal it. Because for all your sin there is grace upon grace upon grace. So come to the table and take the bread and take the wine. For in this table, at this table, there is grace. Hebrews 10, 22 says this, draw near, therefore, with a sincere heart and full assurance, with full assurance of faith that he who promised is faithful. To cleanse, to forgive, to restore, because this light that has come into the world is full of grace and truth and grace. Upon grace, let's go to the table. Thank you.
