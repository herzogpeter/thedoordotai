Two questions around which we will build our thoughts this Easter weekend. The first question is this, who is this man who is called Christ? Actually, it's a question asked by Jesus himself in Matthew chapter 16 verse 13 when he came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, began asking his disciples saying, who do people say that the son of man is in other words who is this man who's called christ what's the word on the street answer came in verse 14 from the disciples some say you are john the baptist they said others say elijah still others say jeremiah or one of the prophets if that question were asked today the answer might be a great teacher is what we hear that's what people say or a good and moral leader, right up there with Elijah, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets, right up there with Buddha, Muhammad, or one of the philosophers. Second question I want to deal with this Easter weekend is really the same question asked at a more personal level. Again, it's asked by Jesus, verse 15, when he says, But who do you say that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, verse 16, Thou art to Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood alone, flesh and blood is involved in this, intellect is involved in this, human capacity is involved in this, but you need to understand, flesh and blood alone did not reveal this to you, but my Father who is in heaven revealed to you who it is that I am. Which tells me that if we are going to answer these questions about who Jesus is this weekend, rightly and well, we need more than flesh and blood to do it. We need more than physical capacity to accomplish it, and so we pray. Join me as I now pray as we enter into the time around the word. Dear Father, by the power of your spirit, I pray that you would reveal what you revealed to Peter about who it is that Jesus is. By the power of your spirit, open our eyes for seeing, our ears for hearing, our minds for thinking, and our hearts for knowing who Jesus is. All this I pray. Amen. There are actually many places we could go to try and answer this question, who is this man called Jesus? From scripture to history to prophecies foretold and fulfilled from things that Jesus said and things that he did, from claims that he made about himself and miracles to miracles that he performed that would all point to and affirm, in some people's minds, it would prove that Jesus is, in fact, the Christ, the Son of the living God. But where I want to go, where I want us to look for the answer to this question this weekend is exclusively found in the context of the events that this weekend speaks so clearly to, namely his crucifixion and his resurrection, which, by the way, are seen in my mind, and I would like you, if you can, to see them in your mind as well as one event, the crucifixion and the resurrection lining up as one event, because one without the other renders the other either meaningless or absurd. For the resurrection without the crucifixion, without actual death, is absurd, making this entire thing a hoax. And the crucifixion without resurrection is a source only of horror, not of hope. So here's the question. What does his dying and what does his rising tell us about who this man is who is called the Christ. Well, let's examine that. Let's look first at his dying and several things about his dying and his rising I want you to see that might tell us something about who he is. First thing might be too obvious to say after I say, well, of course this is true. It's this, just put it in the hopper of your thinking. His dying was public, which means, among other things, that it actually happened. Now, that may not be something all of you need to be convinced of, but some of you may need to know, and even those of you who believe may need to be reminded that this is not a fairy tale, that we just kind of hold on to and hope it's true. This is historically verifiable, his dying. It wasn't a secret. Thousands of people saw it. It wasn't a rumor. It isn't a myth. His dying was public. His dying was known. Tacitus the Roman historian born in 55 AD not a Christian by any stretch of the imagination had to figure out where all these Christians came from at the end of the first century it was a puzzle to him and so he began to do his research and in his historical memoirs wrote this Christos that is Christ from whom these Christians took their name had been put to death by crucifixion during the reign of Tiberius at the hand of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilate. And then Tacitus goes on to wonder why this movement had continued to grow and even grow and find itself manifesting itself strongly even in Rome. And he found himself wondering in his memoirs, writing about them, why even when confronted with torture and death, the followers of this Christ, who was crucified, continued to follow, did not disband or recant the point of the quote I gave you about Tacitus affirming the crucifixion of Christ is simply this. Everybody knew. Jesus lived. Everybody knew. He died. He was crucified and buried. His dying was public. So was his resurrection. the facts of the resurrection, the historical verifiability of his resurrection. It's something we're going to talk a little bit more on Wednesday night. I invite you to come. Greg Boyd is going to be here and talk about the movie The Passion and how it all clicks. And if you have any questions at all, believe me, Greg Boyd, he has any question you have, every, he can answer them all. No pressure for Greg. I want you to know, though, without going into all of the details of this, his resurrection was public. He appeared first, risen to Mary Magdalene in John chapter 20, an eyewitness account. She saw him alive. Some say, well, yeah, she was crazy with grief. People see what they want to see. But then he appeared to Cleopas and another disciple on the road to Emmaus, and they weren't willing to believe. They didn't catch on right away. They weren't looking for this. They weren't expecting this. Then he appeared alive in a physical form to the 11 disciples in Luke 24, Then to ten apostles with Thomas absent who didn't believe. Till the risen Christ appeared also to him saying, see my wounds, touch my wounds. His resurrection was public. His resurrection was physical. It wasn't a ghost. 1 Corinthians 15, verse 1. By the time, by the way, 1 Corinthians 15 was written, it had become, 1 Corinthians 15 had, the fundamental creed of the church. The fundamental creed, rock-bottom belief by which people lived, for which many people were dying. 1 Corinthians 15 says this, Paul speaking, Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also I received, in which also you stand, by which also you have been saved. For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ Jesus died for our sins according to the Scriptures. According to the Scriptures means just like the Scriptures, the Old Testament Scriptures prophesied that he would. Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures and that he was buried and that he was raised again on the third day again, just the way the Scriptures said he would and that he appeared to Cephas and then to the 12. After that, he appeared to more than 500 brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now. So you can go and verify this with them if you want. The point is this. His dying and his rising were public. They were visible. They were seen. They were known. And if this is a hoax, says Paul himself, In 1 Corinthians 15, 19, then we are of all men most to be pitied. Why? Quite simply, because we gave our lives to this. We acted in every way like this was true. How pitiful are we if this is a hoax? We pinned our hopes on this. But he goes on to say in verse 15 of the same chapter, not just to be pitied, truthfully, we are to be scorned because we are liars if Jesus didn't rise. Oh, no, not liars. You're well intended. No, no, he said we are false witnesses of these things. He says in verse 15, because we did not just say Jesus is risen. We said we saw him alive. And so did Cephas. And so did Thomas. And so did James. And so did Mary. And so did 500 at one time. Number one, it was public. Number two, it was painful, this crucifixion, this suffering. The things that Jesus suffered in his body on the tree have in recent days been made vividly clear through a film that many of you have seen, if not all of you have seen in days, recent days, called the Passion of the Christ. From his scourging, to his mocking, to the nails in his hands and feet, his suffering was painful. His crucifixion was painful. His dying was painful. I don't even feel like I need to make a case for that. But part of what moved me so deeply when I was watching the film, probably the best depiction any of us have ever seen of what it is that Jesus physically suffered, part of what moved me so deeply about it is the belief that I have that his physical suffering is but a picture of, is but a symbol of a deeper suffering that wasn't public, that wasn't seen. We see the physical thing. There was more going on beyond what could be seen relative to his suffering. Now, I'm going to explain what I mean by that in just a few moments, but before I do, I want you to know this. It was planned. His dying and his rising was planned. Not just by Pilate or by Herod or by this raging crowd, but by God. It was planned by God. One of the big controversies that in recent weeks, even weeks before this film, The Passion of the Christ, came out, was the controversy around who killed Jesus. And there was great concern, and legitimate in many circles, that it would cause a great rise in anti-Semitism. And that would be a horrible thing, because the perception would be that the Jews killed Jesus. And many, many Christians rose up, even around the film, as it was being released, saying, no, the Jews didn't kill him, we killed him. I killed him. but you need to get it straight God did this this was the plan of God to do this Acts chapter 4 verse 27 says this indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in the city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus whom you anointed I know that but all they really did you need to understand was what your power and what your will had decided beforehand should happen. The Revised Standard Version says the same thing this way. They did what your hand and what your plan predestined to take place. Here's the tip. Just put it in the pot. A little theology. It was planned by God, his dying and his rising. Maybe the best known Bible verse in all of Scripture in fact maybe the only one some of you know is John 3 16 says this for God so loved the world that he what that he gave that he gave his only son God so loved the world that he gave him here's the deal he gave him up Romans 8 32 he who did not spare his own son but delivered him up for what for who for us all. God delivered him up. Wow, I thought Judas did that. That's what we could see. We saw Judas. Judas was upon God delivered him up. God handed him over for love. He did that, and it makes me want to sing, oh, love of God, oh, love of God, how rich and full, how measureless and strong. God gave his only son for God loved me and you. I have a friend. I love this friend. He has a very hard time seeing the face of God. We talk about it from time to time. He has a hard time seeing the face of God as anything but angry, distant, and scowling. and I keep praying and I keep talking and I keep trying to show him the face of God oh could you just turn your head and quit looking could you look at this face that gave up his son it's not the face you're looking at see in his dying I can't see this angry scowling face. Distant? He sent his son. He delivered him up for us all. Angry? Oh, the love of God. So rich. So deep. How measureless and strong. So who is this man who is called the Christ? And what does his dying and what does his rising reveal to us about who he is? so far just this the facts that it was public that it was painful that it was planned by God for love forth that it was payment for sin but not his own well basic theology here Galatians chapter 1 verse 14 says it this way, that Christ gave himself for our sins. It's just right there that way, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age. According to the will of God, to him be the glory forever and evermore. 1 Corinthians 15, referenced it just a moment ago. We speak it again. For I delivered to you as of first importance that Christ died, why? For our sins. It was payment for sin, but not his own and if that weren't enough to win us, to draw us to himself in love, he does something amazing. 700 years before it happens, he describes it for us as a way almost of wooing us to himself as if to say, could I possibly increase my believability to you by telling you what's going to happen 700 years before it does. And by describing it to you in exquisite detail, in the Jewish scriptures that you hold so dear, and he does that very thing in Isaiah 53 verse 5, where through the prophet Isaiah, these words are spoken of the Messiah to come, for he was wounded, pierced through, some translations say, why? For our transgressions. New Testament, it says it this way. He died for our sins. He was wounded for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. And the chastening of our well-being fell upon him, and by his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray. Each one of us have turned to our own way, but the Lord has laid on him just this most unbelievable thing, the iniquity of us all. The Lord laid on his Lord, his son, the iniquity of us all. So it was payment for sin, but not his own, this dying and rising, which brings me back to the things he suffered in order to make this payment, whatever that payment is. The physical pain, we already noted, Beyond description was what we could see. And if you went to the film, we've recently been able to see his physical suffering in ways that are more graphic and probably closer to what it was really like than any of us in this room have ever known before. But there was more going on than what we could see relative to payment and what it cost him to pay it. Many of you know, if you've been around Open Door for any time, that one of my favorite resurrection texts is one that everybody doesn't go to automatically when they think of the resurrection. It's found in Ephesians 4, where it says that he who descended, that is, died, also ascended, that is, rose. Verse 9 says, now this expression, he ascended, what does it mean except that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth? Clearly indicating that after his crucifixion, but before his resurrection, Jesus went someplace. According to Ephesians 4.9, he went to the lower parts. Scholars debate over what that means. Some say that means Hades. Some say that means hell. Whether it's Hades or hell, I don't think it was a real good place to go. Obvious question that I have, and scholars debate over this as well, is what did he do there? 1 Peter 3.19 tells us, at least in part, that he made proclamation to the spirits now in prison. I've done a lot of study on this over the years and have come to see that there, again, is debate. Some believe that this was the cosmic equivalent of a Billy Graham crusade in hell. Kind of a two-day conference. You know, you show up Friday night, all day Saturday, you leave on Sunday morning. Where Jesus is giving the demons one more chance to repent and respond in faith. I don't think so. Indeed, the Greek word for proclamation in 1 Peter 3.19 is not the Greek word euangelizo, which means to good news. It is the Greek word keruso, which means to make a statement of fact. Not an appeal to believe. It is a statement of fact, a proclamation. He went to make proclamation to the spirits now in prison. The more accurate picture, I believe, is this. That at the end of his time, in the lower parts of the earth, just prior to his resurrection, indeed I see it as the resurrection event is just beginning to rumble, as it were. Jesus rose up, and as he did, he made a proclamation. And the proclamation was this, to Satan and all the demons of hell. What you meant for evil, God meant for good. What you supposed two days ago was your greatest victory, is in fact your ultimate defeat. And if you've been at Open Door for any length of time, you know that I actually think I know what he said. Because what I think he said when he made proclamation was this. I win, you lose, bye-bye. And he blew open the gates of hell. Somebody say amen. Amen. He who descended also ascended. And in his ascending, he took his place at the right hand of the Father. And from that place, he sent his spirit into the hearts of men and women like me and like you, alive forevermore, becoming his church on earth, calling people evermore to himself. But all of that raises a question for me that I never really heard anyone answer well or deal with at all, quite frankly, until I read a book called Destined for the Throne, by a guy named Paul Bilheimer some years ago. It's become, in many people's minds, a Christian classic. And then the question that Bilheimer, at least in part of his book, deals with, and I've kind of gone on with it myself a little bit, the question is this. What was happening the rest of the time? Anything? Nothing? Did he go to the lower parts of the earth and just make the proclamation and leave? Maybe. But maybe not. Maybe there was more going on. Think with me here. The Bible says that as Jesus' physical body was dying on the cross, a wonderful, horrible transaction was taking place in mystery. The sin of the world, the Bible says, was coming upon the spotless Lamb of God. staining as it were his very soul with sin. Keep this in mind, but not his own sin. Get the picture here. Though his body on the cross was dying, his spirit, his soul if you will, was very much alive. Which by the way is exactly the way you're going to die. When you die, your physical body will expire. but you, who you eternally are, will be very much alive. Jesus was dying the same way. And as his body on the cross was in physical agony, that's the suffering we could see, as he was dying on the cross, he quite literally was in the process of becoming sin. 2 Corinthians 5.21 says that very thing. Romans 8.3 says that very thing this way, that he took on the form of sinful flesh. Galatians 3.13 says it this way, he became, while he was dying, a curse for us. 2 Peter 2.24 says it this way, that he himself bore our sin in his body on the tree. While his body was dying, the sin was being borne by him, Which means that he is dying the worst possible way a person can die. Well, I knew that. He was being crucified. That's the worst possible way you could die. I saw the movie. I'm not talking about crucifixion. I think physical crucifixion is probably one of the worst ways that you could die. I think it's also possible that in the history of mankind, men or women have suffered more heinous deaths than that. I'm not talking about that part of his death. That's not the worst way. The worst way, that's what I'm referring to, that a person can die, is to die in a place of ungrace, of unforgiveness. For Jesus died with the sin of the world. Get it? Unforgiven on his soul. And in that condition, having become sin, he descended, the Bible says, into the lower parts where hell had legal rights to do to Jesus what it does to sinners, make them pay. Think now, think, think. He paid for sin, but not his own. Beloved, wonder with me. Just wonder about this with me. What if his physical suffering that we can see on the cross and we're moved by it and grateful for it, but what if that physical suffering we see was only a picture of what he really suffered? What if it was only a part of the price he fully paid? What if, what if, what if? Well, it's an interesting thought, Dave. But what about it is finished? Jesus said it is finished on the cross. Well, my question to that question is, what was finished? It's not risen yet, so that's not finished. And without resurrection, the crucifixion has absolutely no value, none whatsoever. So what did he mean, it is finished, when he said it is finished? Well, I believe it can be argued that what was finished was the necessary physical sacrifice of the spotless Lamb of God that once completed, that once finished, set into motion a series of events in the spirit realm that now could not be stopped. It is finished, I think means he crossed the threshold. It is finished, I think means no turning back. Think about it. Prior to the moment of his death, he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the earth and set him free, but he didn't do it. Instead, while he was dying, having taken on our sin, having become sin, the very embodiment of sin, he breathed his last, and the Bible says he descended into the lower parts where he there tasted death for every man. Hebrews 2, 9 says. I'm going to say something that might sound like heresy, but it's not. At least I hope it's not. he tasted death for every minute Jesus didn't taste death on the cross not technically he tasted the process of death on the cross and it was a horrible process Jesus didn't taste death till he what? died and there he tasted death there the grip of death you're not in the grip of death until you die There he experienced the grip of death. He tasted death for every man and paid the price for sin when he descended into. That's where he tasted the death. That's where he paid the price when he descended into the lower parts. But, but, and now I'm beginning to smell Easter. He who descended also, what? Ascended. Here's how I think it happened. This Jesus, who bore our sin in his body on the tree, was in fact an innocent. He paid for sin, but not his own. He was in fact the spotless lamb of God, which means that God could go to work on his behalf and go to work he did. For while Satan was having a party at Jesus' expense, Bill Heimer in the book I just referenced called it a carnival in hell. While Satan was doing that, the fact about this Jesus upon whom Satan was doing what he wanted, the fact about him was this. He wasn't innocent. Therefore, what Satan was doing was illegal. He was off his ground. He had no authority. And so the tables are turned and God goes to war. Acts chapter 2 verse 24 says it this way, that God raised him up, putting an end to the agony of his death. What is the agony of his death? hear this, the agony of his death was not his death on the cross. His death on the cross was agonizing. But when he talks about the agony of his death and putting an end to that, the agony of his death was when he died. The agony of his death was what he was suffering for having descended to the lower parts with the sin of the world on his soul having become sin. Now read the verse. God raised him up again, putting an end to the agony of death since it was impossible for him to be held by death's power. For two days it held him. The grip of death, the fury of hell held him. But here's the deal. He wasn't innocent. He paid for sin, but not his own. He was the holy one of God. Colossians 2.15 says this, that when he burst forth, this is speaking of resurrection, And the bursting forth is a violent explosion. It says as an act of war, he disarmed the principalities and powers. Beloved, it's as if God showed up in hell, the ultimate sting. And with the blood of Jesus dripping off the hands of demons, as it were, God said to them, you got no authority here. You have no right here, precisely because this is the Holy One of God. And the blood they so enjoyed spilling became the cleansing blood, became the precious blood. He who descended also ascended. And as he did, he made a proclamation. And the proclamation was this, to Satan and the demons of hell, what you meant for evil, God meant for good. What you thought was your greatest victory is the ultimate defeat. I hope you enjoyed yourself, because here's the eternal truth. I win, you lose. Bye-bye. And he blew open the gates of hell. Somebody say amen. Amen. He who descended also ascended. And in his ascending, he sat at the right hand of the Father. And from that place, he sends his spirit into the hearts of men and women like me and like you. Eternally alive in his body, the church. And he loves his bride. Hell could not keep him. the resources of the underworld, all of the resources of the underworld, including the grip of death itself, could not hold him. Psalm 107.16 says this, he broke the gates of brass, he cut the bars of iron asunder, and then with a loud voice, he said to the apostle John in a vision that John wrote down so we could see it and hear it as well. He wrote it down in the Revelation. And what Jesus said to John was this, you want to know who I am? You want to know who this Christ, who this Jesus is? I'll tell you who I am. I am the Alpha and Omega. I am the beginning and the end. I am the first. I am the last. I am the living one, for I was dead, but behold. In other words, take a real good look. I am alive forevermore, and I have in my hands the keys of death and hell. In fact, I went to hell to get the keys for you, to set you free. so who is this man who's called the christ more important question who do you say that he is well i think you're probably getting the drift that i agree with peter that he is the Christ, the Son of the living God. But one final question. Actually, this question is a question that Pilate asked the raging mob in Matthew 27. What shall we do then with this man who is called Christ? What do you want to do with him? I'm sure you remember what the mob said. Crucify him. That's what we want to do with them. I'm absolutely convinced that not one person in this room, believer, unbeliever, would say that. But we might, while not, say, crucify them, we might ignore them or deny them, might marginalize them. Some people get all religious around them, which is an interesting way to marginalize them. So much better. if you could ask God to help you see him. Remember when Peter, at the beginning of the message, said, you are the Christ, the Son of the Holy Spirit, and Jesus said, flesh and blood didn't reveal that to you, but my Father in heaven. Something of revelation here. Be really appropriate for some of you if you're interested to ask God to help you see him. Ask God to help you hear him and know him. So much better to receive him and believe him and follow him and serve him. So much better to love him and order your life around him. Right now, we say we worship him. As we declare this truth in Christ alone, our hope is found. You know, one of my favorite stories in the book of Acts is found in Acts 16. Paul is preaching a sermon about the dying and the rising of the Christ. And there was a woman named Lydia listening to him preach. and the Bible says that as Paul was preaching, God opened the heart of Lydia to believe. It reminds me of what Jesus said to Peter when Peter said, Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God. Jesus said, There's more than flesh and blood involved in this. God revealed this to you. Paul was preaching, that's the flesh and blood part. That's an important part. People were thinking about the facts. That's the flesh and blood part. That's an important part. But the Bible says that as he was preaching, God opened the heart of Lydia to believe. Here's what I wonder. I wonder if some of you as you were sitting here this morning wouldn't have had words like that to put on it but I just described to you something that happened to you while I was yelling and screaming. As you were trying to get over the fact he yells way too loud. I'm not coming back here. It's okay. Something was happening because it wasn't about me. God, God was opening your heart to believe that this man you've heard about, you've read about, you went to Sunday school and heard about and have discarded in your mind something in your heart opened and you began to believe. If that happened to you this morning, see, I think there are decisions in faith, but this kind of thing I'm talking about is not so much a decision as it just happened to you. What I want you to do is tell somebody. why don't you tell somebody you know what he just described that happened to me some of you are hearing me talking you're saying well it didn't happen to me while you were talking that didn't happen but you know what I'm a little closer than I was when I walked in here I'm a little more curious about this I'm a little more interested I still got lots of questions I'll tell you your questions are good you don't have a bad question you don't have a bad question Greg's coming Wednesday he's going to answer them all can I tell you something about us I'm the pastor here and I I love this one who is called to Christ there is a way in which I am coming every day to understand who he is because I don't know there's so much more wherever you are on your journey come and join us on the journey we are discovering who he is and what we're discovering is this he is worth our life he is worth our time he is worth our money and he is changing our marriages and he is changing our children and he is changing how we deal with our children and how we love each other. There also is a time, however, that sometimes we need to decide as the question is called, who do you say that he is? And some of you right now, maybe without a lot of emotion, like Lydia, I think, felt, need to decide and maybe with a whisper say, I can't believe I'm saying this, but thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. In fact, I'm going to ask you to do something very odd, and I'm not going to embarrass you. I'm just not going to do it. But I'm going to invite those who are ready to make that decision to either silently in their spirit or just whisper this. If you're ready to do it, this could have power. Because if you say this and believe this, it's going to change your life. Say it with you. Just be with me here. Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. How many of you want to say it who believe it? How many of you just want to say it because you believe it? Let's say it together. Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. whatever's going on with you you need to tell somebody a friend you don't need to tell me you can tell me but you don't need to we're not keeping score we're on this journey all around this man who's called the Christ but if you want to talk to somebody there will be people in the prayer thing down here whatever we call this thing here people standing and you can come let's pray as we close Dear Jesus, we thank you for your inexpressible gift and your immeasurable love. Amen. Amen.
