So, it's a fine line. How do you know when to do what you don't feel like doing? No, no, no, that's true. And it's not going to be when you feel like it, because the point is that you don't feel like doing it. It has to do with your morphology. What is your ultimate goal? What are you getting out of it? What are you getting out of it? If it becomes an end in and of itself, it's not working. It is not an end in and of itself. is a means to an end. The end is the project, the one thing that we will more than anything, and that's to see how close it is for how possible. I can never get that thing right. How close is it possible for a human being to get to God? Yes? If people are meaning afraid, what do you mean by that phrase? Okay, that's, you know, I was having trouble with the possible part of it. It means a lot of different things. I guess it's, I don't know if I could spell out in one word And what it means, close to get to God. Okay, now I'm just going to shoot from the cuff here because I have a working definition up here. I must because I'm using the word. So now I've got to flesh it out. Yeah. Walking with God, walking in the spirit, walking with a sense of his awareness, Walking, maybe this is the essence of it. Walking in such a way, living in such a way that I am not autonomous from God. And I don't experience myself as being autonomous from God. I don't will myself being autonomous from God. I'm not captivated by things that come as a result of being autonomous from God. Where my life is Christ-like. Yeah, Christ was close to God. I'm not trying to aspire to be the incarnate son of God. But that's the model for what it is to be close to God, to be Christ-like, to walk with awareness of his presence, to have my life conformed to his image. Romans 8, 29, is it? It is predestined that we will be close to God. We will be, it says in Romans 8, 29, I believe, or maybe it's 31, something like that, that it is predestined that we shall be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ. That is what I think it is to walk close with God. I don't want to define it externally by how I'm going to look, but more internally, and whatever is external is a result of the internal. Yes. Bravo. That's splendid. Yeah, because the way I said it, you know, on the one hand, you know, the Bible talks, Oh! The Bible talks both ways. You know, sometimes it says, draw nigh unto God and he will draw close to you. And the Bible uses language about drawing close to God. On other times, though, however, the Bible talks in indicatives about how we are already hidden Christ. Colossians 3, we just saw, we're already hidden Christ. In one sense, we're already as close to God as we could be. But in another sense, I don't need to talk, after all that work. But in another sense, we need to draw close to God. And the distinction, I think, is found right here. In terms of what is true about us, we're as close as we could ever be. Isaiah 40, verse 11, he carries us in his arms like a shepherd, a little lamb, close to his bosom. So you can't improve upon that. We're as close as we're ever going to be. Even in heaven, we're not going to get any closer in terms of our righteousness because we're already there. So this isn't like a gradual scale. But in terms of our experience, in terms of how we experience our lives, how we walk, how we understand ourselves, here we have to draw close to God. Here's where we have to get our minds and our souls, our heart, our affections, our thoughts to line up with what is true. And so I don't want to give the impression that this is sort of a ladder that you climb. The disciplines are like climbing up this ladder. I'm getting closer, Lord. I'm getting closer to my... That was Grand Funk Railroad. This isn't a ladder. We're already there. The ladder has to be climbed for us to catch up to where we already are. How's that? We're like a, oh, I just got this kind of slinky model, or caterpillar. You know, the head is already there, but the body has to catch up. So the Lord says, you are everything. And then we got to kind of, well, this is, do you see this slinky thing? I'll send people, like, what are you talking about? A caterpillar? The body's catching up. The old self is catching up. Okay, go ahead. You still have the floor. Yeah, I think, yeah, you can phrase it like that. Getting the flesh, the self out of the way. Yeah. As long as that doesn't have the connotation that this is going to be sort of a laissez-faire thing like, oh, I'm just going to sit back and God's going to do it, because that happens sometimes, and that usually cashes out to me when I feel like doing it will happen. I just got to get out of the way. It takes work to get out of the way. Go ahead. That's exactly right. That's what needs to change. In the end, all areas of our life that are out of sync with God, you know, all the thought processes and behavior patterns and the attitudes that we have and the other stuff in our life that is not conformed to the image of Christ. But all those areas in our life that are out of sync with God are the result of our not experiencing what is true about us. And so in one way, it's a matter of confronting the lie, confronting lies in our life that we received from childhood and all the other places to get to line up with what is true about us. Okay, a couple more. Yeah. This has to be fueled. This has to be fueled. If you don't have, you know, what it sounds like happening is that in one sense, you want to get up at 5 in the morning to pray. You want something, and you think that getting up at 5 in the morning is going to do it. But if the goal isn't concrete, if it isn't real, if it's not fueling you, then you're not going to have the energy to do it. And it may be that, as a matter of fact, this wasn't intense enough. Your experience of this wasn't intense enough to bring forth this kind of behavior. But then you're saying that as you pray to want it more, that begins to happen. And that's a good point. I'll get to you in a second. One of the most fundamental things you can pray is, Lord, change my desires. We're going to talk about honesty here, hopefully tonight. And one of the most important things is to be honest with God about where you're at and not try to be something other than what you really are. And that means coming to God with all your stuff and being as objective about it and laying it out in front of him. And there may even be things where, in fact, I'm sure there are things, aspects in your life, sin in your life, that you don't really want to change. Now, you don't, it's like the kid who got caught with the hand in the cookie jar. You don't want to be caught with the hand in the cookie jar, but you do want the cookie. And it's that way with sin a lot. We don't like the fact that we're not supposed to have this, but we do like having it. And the most fundamental thing is to be real about that. and to say to the Lord, look, this is in my life. You know it's there in my life, and I'm confessing it to you. I wish it wasn't there in the sense that I wish that I didn't want it so bad, but right now I don't even want to get rid of it. To be that real about it, the Lord changed my desire. And as you see the beauty of the Lord loving you amidst of that, that begins to change your desire. The most fundamental thing that can happen to us is for our desires to begin to change. Yes, okay, two more. One, two, and then we'll move on. That's a real good point. We'll be talking a little bit about that later on, about experimenting with different ways of prayer and stuff. And whenever I use an illustration, take that just as an illustration, not as some kind of subliminal rule like I'm secretly suggesting that everybody... I don't give up at 5 in the morning to pray. I pray at night. When I pray in the morning, it's after two cups of coffee, and then it's pretty short. Because morning just isn't my time. You're absolutely right. I throw out illustrations like that. My best time to pray is when I'm walking, walking around the block. And we'll talk about experimenting with maybe even some non-traditional ways of doing stuff. So yeah, the last thing I want to do is say that there's this kind of grid that you've got to fit into. Yes? That's one of the hardest things to do is how do you make the Bible and even just the gospel user-friendly again? Because some of these people have a real love for the Lord, but they're just so beat up by it. Whenever you have, that is good. And I would really be sensitive to that, too. So if you have, what we're, a lot of us come from backgrounds like that. And Open Door seems to be a ministry to people from beat up backgrounds. So this is why this has been a scary thing coming, the whole idea of discipline and recovering this. I'm going to abuse all of you. And so if at points, like your point kind of touched on this also, please feedback to me with the group about things where things might not have been said user friendly. Because I've been out of my legalistic thing for 13 years. And so it's like I've had time to process, but some of this might still be fresh. the way I say something might not be as sensitive as it should be. Like I wouldn't have thought about the five o'clock illustration being used as sort of a norm sort of thing. But now that you brought that up, I could see how that would be. Or about this drawing close to God business. So it's really good that you get feedback. And I appreciate that. Okay, I want to talk. Okay, one more. You're the last one. That's really good. Yeah, we do that. We take this American ideal and we infuse it. Every church service, the quality of it is judged by what kind of spiritual buzz you got. It's just totally off. Sometimes you're supposed to go away from a sermon being ticked off. Good. Okay, now we're going to talk about fasting. We've got a half hour. I wanted to get to honesty too, but we'll just get to fasting. Okay, you know, disclaimer time, disclaimer time. I'm going to take back everything I'm going to say. No. I was here this week at the open door. I was running my little church booth. I'm starting a church in Webber 8, end of commercial. But I had a little church booth out there, so I got to listen to sermons this week. I've written up these notes quite a while ago, and I'm still going to go with the notes. but Dave mentioned for those of you who weren't here and for those of you who were his view of fasting what a fast is I have I'm not sure what to do with this so let me just talk a lot about several things here I'm not sure to what degree I agree with that or disagree with that I agree with it I just don't know to what extent I agree with it whether that's the main kind of fasting or not. His idea is that fasting is something that comes to you. It's not something you choose to do. Although he makes room for the spiritual exercise of fasting as such. I may, I guess this is what I'm saying, I may have a different emphasis than what he had. I'm certainly going to have a different emphasis than what he had in his sermon. But I know Dave, and I don't think he'd have a problem if I came right out and said, I disagree with him on something. I mean, it's not like this is a major issue. And so I just wanted to flag that. It's okay to have disagreements. I don't even think we disagree, but if we do, that's okay. And you don't even have to agree with me. You know, if, no, really, this is, this is like the absolutely, this is typical of the very sort of thing that we should never get hot and bothered about. If it ministers, it ministers. If it doesn't, move on. But anyways, my emphasis certainly is going to be different. I do see a form of fasting as being what comes to you. You get preoccupied or in a state of mourning or a state of seeking God or whatever, and you just don't have time to eat, or you have no desire to eat, or at least you have no desire to party. But I don't know if that's a central kind of fasting. It's certainly not the one that I'm going to be centered on tonight. Let me say a word about the tradition of fasting in church history. Fasting, as defined by the willful, the voluntary abstaining from food, and sometimes water, has been a practice that's been standard throughout church history. We read about it in virtually almost all of the major spiritual writers throughout church history. St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Anselm, St. Bonaventure, we could go on and on and on. They see a value in fasting. I'm going to share some of their ideas of what the value of fasting is. But they define fasting as the voluntary abstaining from food and sometimes also water, or sometimes just certain kinds of food. I mean, there are various degrees of fast and various durations of fast. We'll talk about that. But it's been a standard practice throughout church history. It's been a standard practice that on certain occasions when the church was confronting major decisions, to declare that we should have a fast and to corporately go on a fast where you voluntarily abstain from food. This isn't something, though, that's just isolated to Christianity. It's practiced by almost every major world religion. And sometimes, in fact, many times, the form that fasting takes in Buddhism or in Hinduism or in Islam is a form of asceticism where they're getting life from, abstaining from food. It kind of is a point thing. But many times, it's not that. Many times, it's just that people have seen the spiritual value, even non-Christians have seen the spiritual value of denying your body something which is very natural to it. And I think that's a true thing. We're all wired the same way, whether you're Buddhist or Christian, and they can, on their own natural capacities, discover things that work spiritually. And fasting has been one of the things that is most common to other religions. The only reason I'm putting this up front, I want to say another disclaimer here, is not because I think this is really important. Although I do think it's kind of important. I'm putting it up front because that's not why I put it up front. Tell me I'm right. But the reason I put it up first is that I want to give an invitation to all who want to do this to make Wednesday a day of fast. Fast day. And to use that as kind of a spiritual discipline throughout this course. Okay, let's look at it in scripture. what does the Bible have to say about fasting? And I was going to look up all these verses, but I'm not going to. I'll just kind of tell you what they say. In Scripture, sometimes fasting is, frequently fasting is associated with seeking direction from the Lord, seeking the Lord's will. In 2 Corinthians 20, Jehoshaphat and the Israelites are under attack. And so Jehoshaphat proclaims a fast to all of Israel and says we need to seek God. And so he declares a fast. They go on, and it doesn't say how long their fast was, but they all went on a fast. In Judges 20, verse 26, the Israelites are fighting the Benjamites, and they're losing. And so it says that they, for a day, chose a fast. They fasted for a day and sought the Lord's will. What do you want us to do, Lord? Should we go and fight, or should we not go and fight? What's really strange is that the Lord says, go fight, and the Benjamites kick the daylights out of them. But anyways, that's the side point. It's a really strange passage. I never noticed that until today. I was looking it up and I was like, what? Whoa. Esther 4.16. This is where Esther tells Mordecai to have all of Israel fast. And here they go three days. She says, I want you to fast for three days without food or water, which is radical. Because she's going to go into King Xerxes and try to persuade him to be gentler to the Jewish people, at least not to exterminate them. It's very dangerous because she could kill. And this is where she says her famous thing, but if I perish, I perish. But she declares, she has Mordecai declare a three-day fast that all of Israel partakes in. In Daniel 9.6, actually it should be, I think, 9.3, Daniel's pleading with God in prayer, and he says he pleaded with God with prayer, petitions, and fasting. So the fasting was a way of pleading with God. I don't know what you want to do with that, but... In Jeremiah 36, 6 through 9, Jeremiah calls for a day of fasting. and to have the word of God read as a way of bringing Israel to repentance. He says we need to have the word of God read, so I want you to fast as we read the word of God. So he declares a day of fasting. Sometimes fasting is associated with worship and spiritual direction. In Acts 13, 2 and 3, here's where they're seeking the Lord. Where should we go in terms of the direction of the church here? And so it says that they worshiped the Lord and fasted. And when they worshiped the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said to them, set apart for me Paul and Barnabas to be missionaries. So their worship and fasting was connected with their hearing from the Lord. In 1423, something similar goes on. It says that they were worshiping the Lord and fasting. And they did this in order to choose what leaders to put up in certain congregations. And so they had worshiped the Lord and fasted, and then they'd lay their hands on people and pray with them in order to point them to positions of leadership. Sometimes fasting in Scripture is connected with humility, with expression of humility and dependency. David says in Psalms 35, 13, I humbled myself with fasting. In Isaiah 58, 3 and 5, the Lord is criticizing the Israelites here because of their hypocritical fasting, which we'll get to shortly, but here it's clear that in his criticism of the Israelites fasting that one of the purposes of fasting was to humble yourself and to show your dependency on the Lord. The Lord says the purpose of fasting is not only to humble yourself, but also, and then he goes on and says some other things, humility. And in these instances, I think it's really possible to see the fast as being involuntarily, as being involuntary, where it just happens to you. 1 Samuel 7, 6, that's where the Israelites are mourning, and they fast, and they confess their sin. I forget what they even did, but they're bent out of shape about it all. 2 Samuel 12, 16, 21 through 22, this is where David's son is really sick. This is where Nathan comes and lays the bomb on him, and David tries to plead with the Lord, and he mourns, and he fasts. And then the baby dies, and he gets up and eats. um first chronicles 10 12 again uh the the israelites repent this is where saul gets uh killed and he falls down and the philistines come and they chop his head off and they take it and they bring it home the bible tells you all this puts they put it on a mantle you know like like like lord of the flies or something anyways um and so the israelites uh repent and it says that they mourn and fast. It's associated with mourning and fasting. And this I could see being things where it just kind of comes upon you. Daniel 10.2, he fasts for three weeks. And during this time, he receives visions. And part of that is mourning and repentance. Finally, in Jonah 3.5-10, old Nineveh, when Nineveh repents, Jonah is the one who mourns, but Nineveh goes on a fast. So, okay. There are other times in Scripture where fasting is seen to be a regular practice. In Acts 27.9, Paul is going on the ship ride. I forget where they're going, but he's going on a ship. Luke makes this phrase that it was dangerous to go because of the day of the fast. In any case, the Day of Atonement is referred to, and it's referred to as the day of fast, the day of fasting. In Leviticus 16, 29 through 31, in Leviticus 23, 27 through 29, you find that Moses says that on the day of atonement, you're supposed to deny yourself. The Hebrew literally has afflict your soul, afflict your soul. It doesn't specify fasting at all, but it does just say afflict your soul. There's a long tradition in Judaism that held the day of atonement as being a day of fast. And that was a regular practice that the Jews did. And eventually, the Day of Atonement came to be referred to as the Day of Fast. And that's how it's referred to in Acts 27, verse 9. In Luke 18, verse 12, you have the Pharisee praying in the temple, and he says something which was not too uncommon there. He says, Lord, I give alms all the time, and I fast twice a week. It was a common practice among the Pharisees, as well as other Orthodox Jews, to fast two times a week. It was just a part of their regular practice. In Acts 2:37, Luke says that Anna, who was the mother of Elizabeth, who was the mother of John the Baptist-- I think I got that right-- says that she was always praying in the temple and she fasted all the time. It was a regular practice. And many scholars believe that what he was referring to was simply that she kept the regular two day a week fast that were customary for the Jews. So it was a regular kind of thing that the Jews were a part of. Finally, I want you to see that in Scripture, there's something said about hypocritical fasting. You find this in Isaiah 58, where it became just a ritual. They would have, oh, I should say this, that there was also other days, going back to the regular practice of fasting, there were other days as well that the Jews would fast on. There was at least four other holidays, not holidays, but memorials throughout the year that the Jews would fast the whole day, from sunrise to sunset on. One was the commemoration of the destruction of the temple and certain things like that. And they'd go on a fast during those times. And there are other days as well. It would depend on what group you are with. Some Orthodox Jews, even today, have 28 calendar fasts, 28 days out of the year where they don't eat. Some have 20. Some, you know, they vary. Orthodox Jews customarily have 28, though. Okay, finally, on hypocritical fasting, in Isaiah 58, the Lord here says, do you think that the only purpose for fasting is to humble yourself and to make a show out of it? Is this just a ritual that you're doing? Here's the fast that I call for, the Lord says. I want you to, and then he tells them to, be concerned about the needs of the widows and be concerned about the needs of the poor and the hungry, because they were neglecting all these things, what had happened is that they were making fasting an end in and of itself. Like somehow we're really religious because we fast. Forgetting what Jesus called the weightier matters of the law, the other things, the far more important things. The purpose of fasting is not to fast. The purpose of fasting is other things that it does for you. But here it was becoming sort of a ritual, and people were priding themselves on it without being involved in the needs of their neighbors. Matthew 6, 16 through 18, Jesus says something quite similar. When he says, when you fast, this is interesting, he tells his disciples this, when you fast, he assumes that they're going to fast. But when you fast, don't do it like these Pharisees do. They do it twice a week. But when they do it, they want everyone to notice it. So they go down and they make themselves look all sackcloth and ashes, that kind of stuff. And they go on mourning and, oh, I'm so hungry. Don't do it like that, but rather wash your face and hide it. Do it in secret. Your father which sees in secret will reward you. So when you fast, it's good to not make a big deal out of it. And if you find yourself wanting to make a big deal out of it, that's time to check your motivation. Did you know I was fasting today? Yup, that's the third day in a row. Or when you're fasting and someone brings up some food next to you. Oh, I'm fasting. I wish I could have a quarter pound of cheese. upon no cheese. But that's okay. 1 Timothy 4.8, Paul warns against false asceticism, people who get life from saying don't eat this or don't drink that or all this other kind of stuff. It's not a source of life. Okay, that's basically what Scripture says about it. Now I want to draw this together and point out some benefits of fasting. Some benefits from fasting. First of all, physically. Again, I'll say more about this shortly, but physically on condition that, and now there's some conditions. You're not anorexic. You're not diabetic. You're okay from your doctor. You don't have a heart disease. Check with your doctor if there's any question about this. If you're a healthy person, if you're relatively healthy, fasting is good for you physically. There are some doctors, some health specialists, who say that the human digestive tract wasn't made to eat food every day. In fact, there's one guy out in Stanford University who is a specialist on aging. And he claims he's going to live for it to be 150. And secret, he says, is-- well, he's got some weird things I think he's trying to sell. But, uh, uh, metalicoatement. But, uh, you know, but one thing is he says he only eats every other day. And then he has a special diet that he does. But I've heard that from a number of other people, too. No, I don't recommend just eating every other day. But I think there is a truth to the idea of giving your digestive tract a break once in a while. I think it's really good. It kind of purges your system. To go on a fast physically, I think, is on the condition that you're relatively healthy and you're not going to have anything go wrong with you, a healthy thing to do just from a physical standpoint. Has anyone found this to be the case? There was a book written that I read some time ago, and I can't remember too much what it says, but it said fasting as the key to physical health or well-being or something like that. It was all in the physical ramifications of fasting. It's amazing the junk that we have in our digestive tract. One of the things that happened, I've done this, where you go on a three-day fast, and what's amazing is the stuff that still comes out of you after three days. I try to think of a delicate way of saying that, but it's true. It's like, man, how much do you have to scrape the bottom of the barrel? But, you know, all that food gets caught in there. It's good just to kind of just flush it out. Yes. Another thing about this I should say, though, is this. Some of you read last summer about this couple that went on a 21-day fast when they were up in the Bounty Waters, and the woman died. Do you realize? And it was because they weren't drinking any water. Yeah. What amazes me, and these people, I understand, Christian, they were just doing it for physical reasons or some kind of a thing or something like that. But they were up in the Bounty Wars and they had food galore and they had all this nice water galore and the discipline it must have taken them to go without food and water to the point of dying right when there's all this water around you amazes me. I mean, I wonder a little bit about what they're thinking, but I admire the discipline in one kind of morbid sense. It just blows my mind. It's important, you know, if you go on a fast, there's two verses where it says Jesus and Moses went on a 40-day fast without food or water, and that was supernatural. That had to be supernatural because there's no way you could physically do that. It's not advisable to go without water for more than a day. And so really be careful with that. I drink a lot of fluids. And from a physical point of view, it's best to drink a lot of fluids while you're on a fast. That helps flush things out. But be very careful with the liquid business. Someone else had their hand up? Oh, one other thing. People do go on prolonged. Richard Foster recommends building up to a 21-day fast. But if you go much beyond that, you're going to need divine intervention. I wouldn't do it unless you really hear a voice like in a loudspeaker telling you to do it. Because at that point, the body starts feeding on itself. As I understand, it's around three weeks. That's when you actually begin to starve. Now, you feel like you're starving your first lunch. But that's something more than the stomach saying, hey, the clock says you're supposed to feed me. You really-- the body doesn't get to the point of starvation if you start in a fairly well-fed state until about three weeks. And that's when it starts actually eating itself. Right prioritization. We're going to be a real practical class here. One of the benefits of this is that you assert the right priority of the relationship between your body, your mind, and your spirit. Your body is given to you by God. We're physical beings and your body is given to you to use. It is not supposed to use you. That's why Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10, All things are permissible to me. I don't know the verse. But I will be mastered by nothing. I will be mastered by nothing. Nothing should have control over me. Not my food, not nicotine, nothing should have control over me. I am God's creature. I'm called to have dominion over the earth. It's not supposed to have dominion over me, and my body's part of the earth. So this is a way that you affirm, you take control of yourself. Now again, we live in a self-gratification society which says that to suffer is really a bad thing, and especially when it comes to eating. We think we have a right to eat, we think we have a need to eat, And we can become slaves to eating. And this is a way of just saying, no, I am going to choose to be the lord of my body. I'm going to master over it. And it's a good thing to do just because of the exercise of self-control that it exhibits, to get good at that. I have found that discipline, as well as non-discipline, is contagious. If you're disciplined in an area of your life, it will tend to percolate over on other areas of your life. You develop a disciplined mindset. That's why people who are into sports and stuff can be disciplined about other areas, or at least they have an easier time of that. Whereas a person who is undisciplined in most areas of life has trouble being disciplined about any area of their life. It's sort of contagious. By taking one day a week, if that's what you want to do, or one day a month, and going on a fast, a full or partial fast, we'll talk about that later on, but just by being disciplined about it, you're asserting that control. you're asserting that I will not be a slave to my body you're asserting that you're not afraid of going through some inconvenience it's spiritually growing if for no other reason than just because of that Thank you.
