Open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, the sixth chapter, the first verse in our continuing study in this most precious book. Ephesians chapter 6, verse 1. Children, obey your parents and the Lord, and here's a good reason, because it's right. Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with the promise, that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth. And fathers or parents do not provoke or incite your children to anger or hostility, but instead of that, bring them up in the discipline or nurture and instruction or admonition of the Lord. Let's pray as we begin. Father, we have indeed sensed your presence here this morning. And there is indeed an openness already here to what you would say to us. I would simply ask, continue, to keep our hearts tender to you. And Father, most of all concerning me, I need so badly to more and more be applying these things to me and my family. And even as I preach, speak to me. I ask that in your name. Amen. We've discovered way back in the 18th verse that all of these things are going together. And as we're beginning to move into this incredibly important section on the Christian family, that all of these things have been catalyzed or set into motion by the filling of the Spirit in verse 18. the filling of the Spirit in its most profound and obvious conclusion or result is that relationships in our lives are healed we found out first of all that my relationship with myself that may sound silly but it really doesn't if any of us are honest with ourselves is first of all healed the guilt and the alienation and all those things that make me feel like less than someone who matters is taken care of when I first accept Christ but I don't always experience the fullness of that. The filling of the Spirit is what takes that from a positional truth to a practical truth. I sing. The second relationship that is healed is the one I have with the Lord. I sing and then the second thing I do is when I'm full I say thanks to God. And the third is that the filling of the Spirit profoundly affects my relationship with you. Verse 21, And be subject one to another because you love the Lord so much in the fear of Christ. Serve one another. And then Paul, in an effort to try to illustrate this graphically, what it means in the body of Christ to be serving one another and being subject to one another, he basically says this. This is what I mean. It's just like in the home. Be subject one to another. Wives to your husbands. Husbands to your wives. Husbands, love your wives. Lay down your lives for your wives. Your example for how you should be loving your wife is the example of Christ Himself, who came not to be served, but to serve. And very obviously, without any twisting or trying to sound cute or bringing a new teaching or anything like that, it is real obvious, men, that if anyone has laid at their feet the responsibility to be the servant in the household, it is us. and now we come to the children and to the parents the home i sat at my desk for two hours yesterday without writing down a word i do my final drafts on saturday work all week long on my sermons and i have notes all over the place and if you ever came to my office you'd think it was a disaster area but on saturday i bring it all together i do my final draft and basically on saturday i'm ready and i just kind to write down and put into as concise a form as I can. And I sat at my desk for two hours and didn't write a word because I didn't know how to begin. I didn't want to tell you again that this is the most important passage. But I want to tell you that. The other thing is God is dealing with me so much about the family and my family. So many times that I hear people speaking on the family, and I have to say that I really envy them. Swindoll is doing a series right now. Listen to it, it's great. I've been able to hear little bits and pieces. Dobson is doing things, and so often it seems like these are people who have kind of gone through it and are looking back and telling us how, and I think that's great. I'm in the position where we're going through it. I'm in the middle of it. My kids are little. So much needs to be learned here, And even as I speak, I am learning it. And take these things with that in mind. Psalm 127, verses 3 through 5 says, Behold, children are a gift from the Lord. I believe that. The fruit of the womb is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man. so are the children of one's youth how blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them we're living in a world today that does not believe that one bit and it bothers me a lot I love my kids but one of the things that I love about our church one of my favorite times in our whole Sunday morning and Sunday evening is after church when we're out there talking to people and there's this army of kids running all over the place and making noise and crying and putting on their tights and pulling off their clothes in front of everybody and it's... Those are our kids. They're our kids. And what I'm sharing with you this morning isn't just for people who have kids that age, or people who have teenagers, or it's for us. Because these are our kids. But we live in a day today where we are being pumped, and I'm afraid that it even creeps into our thinking. More than we'd like to admit. Where children are a bother, and children are a nuisance, and children are not a gift from the Lord, but they're a pain in the neck. we have raised a generation of parents I'm afraid who themselves are in a position of being very much so emotional cripples so self-centered and so incredibly self-absorbed that we don't know how to love and we don't know how to give we don't know how to care and that cycle right there of raising up a generation of those who are self-centered and self-absorbed and don't know how to take care of their children is the cycle we're talking about right here that has been reversed by the filling of the Spirit. Wives and husbands produce children. And if wives and husbands aren't submitting to one another in love and leaving that legacy of love to their children, you're going to raise another generation of what we have today. Everything we read and hear and see tells us over and over again that the American family, as we know it, is going through, at best, radical changes. And maybe at worst, absolute destruction. The statistics tell us that, what is it, one out of two marriages are ending in divorce now. That's an old one. You've heard it millions of times. It may be more than that. One thing I read this week is that less than 10% of all children today are living in traditional homes. Now, whether this is good or bad or not, that's something you need to debate. But less than 10% are living in traditional homes where the father is there and the mother is there and the mother is staying home or at least someone is staying home with the kids. Children aren't convenient. We are living in a day when other things are more convenient. And we are living in a day when children aren't one of those things. But you know one of the things that is convenient is abortion. the result of that is that 3,600 little babies are aborted every 24 hours that's one and a half million every year in New York alone there were more abortions than babies born last year I don't read Ann Landers in fact it was my wife who made me aware of that my wife reads Ann Landers but she took a survey and how valid this is, I don't know, but it still bothers me. She asked a question, and the question was this, if you had an opportunity to do it over again, would you have children? Would you have the children you have? And 78% said they wouldn't. Satan is assaulting the home. And we are being affected. We would like to think that we're not, but we are. And I believe with all my heart that if there is an area today where we as believers need to stand and rise up and demonstrate something distinctively different than the world, it's that we need to demonstrate a distinctively different home. I'm burning with this. But we are not immune, people, to the destruction of our homes. Christian businessman in Dallas, very successful, loved the Lord, active in his church, ambitious, very successful. Lots of good intentions, a pillar, loved his kids. Had four of them. Two of them had their brains absolutely fried with drugs. One of them ended up involved in prostitution for a long period of time, and one of them is still being sought. And almost every state of the Union hasn't been seen in nine years. Was saying to his pastor one day with tears streaming down his cheek, if you were to tell me that I could have my kids back by severing my arm, I would tell you to do it and do it now, and I don't care. Pastor, I have spent my entire life climbing the ladder of success only to realize my ladder was up against the wall I didn't care about. A young couple in Chicago just bought a new home. Things are going real well. He's working at nights and she's working during the day. They have a little one, shuffle them around a little bit. It's hard. Their marriage begins to fall apart. Need to meet with the pastor. How are we going to do that? And so we get together and we talk and we try to find a time and we work it out and try real hard. And the time that's good for him isn't good for her. And the time that's good for her isn't good for him. And we're really working on it. And Saturdays are the worst for the pastor, so what do we do? And on and on and on it goes. And our marriage is falling apart. And what are we going to do with our kid? And finally it comes down to the point, Are you willing to give something up so you can come together and make your home work? Well, you can't do that, Pastor, you see, because we just bought a house and we need both those jobs because we'll lose our house because we've got to have a home. Who do you think you're kidding? Young father in our church right now, here this morning, riding with his little one in the car, absorbed with his own thoughts, good thoughts. This father loves his kids. This father loves the Lord. After several overtures to this young dad, of I want to talk, I want to talk, I have something to say, and constantly being ignored, suddenly the little girl bursts out into tears. Not real polite tears, real angry tears. I have a discipline problem, that father says. Pull over to the side of the road and deal with this. and with tears streaming down the cheeks and angry crying this little girl says to her daddy daddy why don't you want to be with me that was my little girl we are not immune and maybe the greatest danger that we could face in dealing with the distinctively Christian home is to think we are. It's to think because I have trained my kids to act in a certain way and to plaster smiles on their face and to not wet their pants and to not do this and not do that that we're doing really well and never know them and never sit in the car and talk to them. I have shared with you before the pain that my own family went through. What a joy it was for me to have my dad here with us this last week. I don't know anybody who's closer to their dad than I am. But there was a time in our family when that closeness was not there. And two older sisters who didn't feel that love and that communication and that thinking they were important at all went through incredible kinds of pain. These lessons are hard to learn and we are not immune. Satan is assaulting the home. Let me show you why. Turn with me to Deuteronomy 6, would you? I want you to know something about Israel. The Jewish people, God had made them His chosen people. The apple of His eye. Precious promises were theirs. But one of the things we need to understand, and we have spoken of this before, that God did not give those promises to His people so that they could kind of be a bucket, a dispenser of His promises, where they would just go and sit and be a blessing on them. The purpose of His blessing upon them was that they were to be a channel of His love and His forgiveness and His mercy to the rest of the world. And the problem with the people of Israel in that day is the same problem with us in this day, and that is that we take it in and take it in and never give it out. The point is to pass it on. Verse 4, chapter 6, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. That is the truth. That is your theology. But before you do anything, step one. Here's what I want you to do with it, okay? Here's what I want you to do with the truth and the promises of God. First of all, these words which I am commanding you today shall be on your heart. First of all, you've got to commit yourself to it. They aren't just laying there and they're going to be dumped on you without your will. First of all, you've got to make a commitment to it. After you've made a commitment to it, this is what I want you to do. And you shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead. Everything about you will reek of this. and you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. It isn't enough to tell your kids about the Lord. You have to live it when you're sitting, when you're standing, when you're walking, on your forehead, on your hands, everywhere. God's priority in passing on his truth is not necessarily through the prophet. The prophet came. You know why the prophet came? The prophet came to take the dads and shake them up and say, tell your children. Deal with your children. Share with your kids. Parent to child. That's God's priority plan in passing on His truth. But I want to tell you something, and this is real obvious. If that's God's plan, mark this and mark it well. Satan's plan to destroy that righteous seed, to destroy the family, to break them up and keep us strangers in our own homes. dads we are under attack there is no doubt about it and I believe one of the places where we have most failed is the fact it's this big macho thing we talked about last week that in a very real and bold and brash way without pulling any punches we have just plain abdicated our responsibility and privilege of dealing with our kids and loving our kids and raising our kids to our wives. That's the whole submissive headship thing that we've got followed up in our heads. See, I'm the breadwinner. I go home to work and I work hard and when I come home I'm going to have a can of beer and I'm going to read the paper and watch TV and don't bother me. You know what? After a while they won't. What kind of legacy are you leaving your kids, dads? What kind of legacy are you leaving them that you can put a ball in a hoop, that you can put a bat on a ball, that you can put a little black disc into a net, that you can teach them how to get into a stance and fire out real hard. I think those things are great. They just aren't real important. Dads, do you talk to your kids? Do you? Yeah, we talk to our kids. We talk... Do you listen to your kids? Do you talk to them about Jesus? Do you know what they mean when they laugh? Do you know what they mean when they cry? Do you listen? Do you know them? Do you know them? Moms are under attack too. Again, we're living in a day. And I want to tell you something. I don't have the rules all clearly defined. Women, stay sure. I just know this, that we are living in a day when this whole concept of family and someone being at home and being with the kids is something that is really almost despised. That homemaker concept is really not a high calling at all. What really will fulfill you is something, anything, but not here. Not with the kids. Not with that family. And I really want to be careful not to make any judgments here, but just make you ask questions of yourself. Psychology Today, February 1980, says this, the greatest change that we are seeing in terms of the family is the form of the middle-class mothering concept. Women now going to work and kids are going into daycare. For many children, this article said, they are never really rooted at home. from six months sometimes, out of the cradle, into a daycare center of some kind until they're five years old, and then when they turn five, they go into a public school for the rest of their lives. Denver Post had an article not long ago where it spoke of the workers at a daycare center who were going to form a union because the kids that parents were sending them were so abusive and so hard to handle and so absolutely uncontrollable that they needed some sort of protection against the kids. Because what was happening, the parents were just dropping the kids off and never having any input. It was all up to the daycare center. And we have that same, we have an institutional mentality today with our children. You see, it's the daycare center that raises my kids, and it's the school that raises my kids, and we look at the church to raise my kids. There is no institution, none, that can do what God has called you to do and me to do in my family. and we look at the church and we get real frustrated because they're not doing what they should with my kids we can only do with those kids what is brought to us and those schools can only do with those kids often what is brought to them we can't abdicate responsibility to someone else it's ours I believe the pain being inflicted on people through the agency that God has ordained to build people the family just boggles the mind. This thing that God ordained to build people and make them strong and make them healthy and make them feel good about themselves and secure and loved so they know how to love is being used now by Satan to destroy lives and so they're feeling never loved, not knowing how to love. And the cycle continues. examples Milwaukee Circuit Court 1979 Judge Michael Goulet passed down the first divorce of a parent of a child the parent was wanting nothing to do with their child the article related how the parents of a sobbing 16 year old girl said we don't want her anymore they put her in a state home and paid child support for the rest of her life suicide among children doesn't that sound disgusting suicide among children. Childhood is supposed to be full of fun and joy and cheerful innocence. And for years, people have doubted if children were even capable of suffering any kind of deep depression that would cause them to despair of life. A woman by the name of Charlotte Ross, in an article February 7, 1981, this woman is the director of the San Mateo Suicide Prevention Center, said children today, as young as six years old, trying to kill themselves. Despairing of life at six. Some estimates, she went on to say, some estimate that 10 to 15% of all children at one time or another contemplate suicide because they don't feel wanted, they don't feel loved, they don't feel that life is worth living. Lois Timnit, Chicago Sun-Times article not long ago, writes this. An 11-year-old boy has slashed his wrists. I want to go to heaven, he sobbed. I can't stand these stomach aches and being unhappy. If I could only die, it's hard to live. Nobody cares if I live, I want to die. 12-year-old girl hung her doll by the neck, cut its legs with scissors, finally slashed her own wrists, said this, I would be better off dead, then no one would have to look at my ugly face. These are our kids. little boy, 11 years old attempted to kill his dog suffocate his brother, why? then tried to kill himself and when he was asked why he said, because I hate everybody and everybody hates me tell those kids children obey your parents that is so important children, to obey your parents but parents somewhere along the line the cycle starts with us God has laid at the feet of mom and dad the privilege and responsibility of bringing them up in the nurture and admonition it all started back in verse 18 parents who are filled with the spirit controlled by the spirit submitting to their husbands submitting to their wives leaving a legacy of love to their children verse 4 and parents do not provoke your children to anger but bring them up. Provoke. It means to incite. It means to irritate. It means to put them in a position where they are smoldering. You ever see your kids smoldering? See, they're not allowed to tell you how they feel, right? They're not allowed to deal with that. In fact, they don't know how. The only way they know how is to stamp their feet and that's always inappropriate and they get spanked for that so they smolder until they're 16 and then they can do something about it and they do it. And the catalyst very often for that smoldering is us. We're provoking too often. All sorts of ways to do it. I'm sure as you sit here and think about provoking your children to smoldering and seething, you can think of all sorts of things that would do that. Too much discipline, but then we've got to balance it off because we have to have discipline. We'll be talking about that as we go through this. By the way, this is an introduction. One of many. We're not even going to get to the text today. Get to it next week. Discipline is important. It's absolutely necessary. One of the things I'd like to dump on you is something I heard last week at a seminar that Jeff did. The rules are in our families to protect and to control and to nurture and love our kids and to give them structure within which to grow. They are not there to just kind of hold them down and keep them in control so that they can't do anything and can't ever learn anything. There has to be discipline. But that's not what we're talking about today. We're talking about things that are unnecessary, provoking, all sorts of ways. One thing you can do is overprotect your kid. We've talked about that before. Fence him in. Never trust your kid. Never give him room to decide for themselves. Never do that. Just decide everything for him. Never give him an opinion. Just be real sure that in a real strong way you communicate that what they think and what they want just doesn't matter. We have this wonderful way of asking our kids what they want and telling them that they can't have it. What do you want to do? You want to go to Arby's or Denny's? Denny's. Well, we're going to Arby's. Tough. I was hoping you'd say Arby's, but you're not going to win anyway. This is sometimes hard. Do you ever ask your kid what dress they want to wear? If you don't want them to wear the ugly dress, don't ask them. Because if you ask them, they'll probably want to... Ours always wants the ugly one. I don't know what it is. The one that doesn't please us, anyway. I remember Erica not long ago wanted to wear this coat. And someone had given it to us, the Salvation Army or something. It was new, you know. She had never worn it, so it was new. It was ugly. But she wanted to wear it, and we didn't want her to. I was taking it away. No, I don't want to wear it. Let her wear it. Let her look ugly. Let her decide something on her own. She has a choice and we take it away all the time. You ever tell your kids what they like? They choose the blue dress and you say, oh, you like the red dress. I know you like the red dress. They're not eating your food. You like spaghetti. They don't like spaghetti. How do you feel when people tell you how you feel? Doesn't it drive me nuts? nothing bothers me more. People who know how I feel more than I know how I feel are the hardest people in the world for me to get close to. I just feel like there's never any room for me to be who I am. They've got it all figured out. They know how I feel. They know how I react. Oh, that's the way you are. Yuck. When they're sad, you're not sad. You can't be sad. remember the story of a mom who was with her little daughter in a restaurant a waitress came up and a waitress did something that would be absolutely unforgivable i'm sure but they asked the mom what what she wanted and the mom said what she wanted and then she asked a little girl well what would you like and the mom says well she would like a uh a small piece of french toast milk and nothing more and the waitress looked at her and looked back at the little kid and said what would you like for breakfast? She goes, I like a hamburger and french fries and chocolate milk and all stuff like that. And the mother said, she would like a little piece of french toast and a small glass of milk. And that's all. Would you like ketchup with that hamburger? You know. On and on and on this went. She took the order and left and I don't know if the mom won or not, but all I know is this, that the little girl after the waitress left looked at the mom and says, Mom, she thinks I'm real. I could go on and on with that. In the next few weeks, we're going to get into some of that kind of thing. But I want to leave you with one thing that plagued me throughout my entire study this week and the research that was coming together. It was troublesome to me. that in all the research and study that I did, that there was one factor that came up over and over and over again as being a real link in terms of causing deep kinds of emotional problems in our children. The one I'll use is a study done by Dr. Armand Nicoli. Dr. Armand Nicoli is a born-again Christian who is a full professor at Harvard Medical School. and he has just completed a 10-year study doing research, thousands and thousands of cases, histories from all over the United States and over and over again his findings confirmed one thing. By the way, the book that he's doing, this is so fresh that the book isn't even published yet. It was in Christianity Today, kind of a synopsis of it in Christianity Today just a few months ago. But over and over again his findings confirm this, that the number one single most common factor in functional neurosis. And that means that they aren't physically sick, that something is emotionally wrong with these children. And again, these other studies I was doing was over and over and over again. This was it. The thing that was most often the result, the cause of kids being referred to these institutions, excuse me, was this. The inaccessibility of one or both the parents. And he was quick to point out in his study that inaccessibility that the lack of that parent being accessible to that child all it had to be was perceived inaccessibility. So that opens the door quite a bit more. See right off the bat I think aha divorce working mothers da da da da da all down the line the things I think of right off the bat. All it has to be for that child is to be perceived inaccessibility. The number one result he went on to say of a child who feels that his parents are inaccessible who feels that he has been abandoned is seething hostility. Ephesians 6, verse 4. You know, leaders, we see that in Awana, don't we? We see that in our kids who come to Awana. There's a seething hostility in some of those kids because there's no access. They've been abandoned. And I'm afraid we see that in some of our own homes. you know what I see in my home I see and this is something that that I am learning and in the process of correcting and you pray for me in this and I will pray for you because I'm sure we're all involved in this kind of thing but you know what I treat you different than I treat my family in a real way I treat you a lot different than I treat my family I like to project and I like you to feel like there is there is nothing I wouldn't stop and drop and leave and go and meet some sort of emergency kind of need here. Nothing. I want you to feel like you have access and all that kind of wonderful stuff. And that is as it should be. But there are times when I wonder if my family gets the same message. If my kids get the same message. That kids, I would drop anything for you. I would drop anything for you. There is nothing that is more important than the needs that you have and I'm here to help. And I'm here to listen. Moms and dads, there's more than a few ways to make ourselves inaccessible to our kids. We think again of divorce, death, is another way that a parent becomes inaccessible to his child. And we would say, well, man alive, there's nothing you can do. What do you do about that? I think we need to first of all realize that those kids are going to be wounded. the next question is this are single parents just doomed? I don't think so and I think even as I begin to illustrate this further we're going to see that often single parents though it is hard and those kids have been wounded that very often single parents are in a position where they have been slapped in the face and realize that I have got to pour my life into this I have got to give myself and focus some attention and often they can come through as gold for us for us who are single parents for those people in our church who are single parents the worst thing you could do though is to just think that somehow automatically the kids are going to be okay they aren't they need help maybe more than most and maybe as a church we need to realize that too I was so thrilled at our elder board meeting last week when we began to talk about a ministry to widows in our church, to people especially some of our young women who are in this kind of position to make sure somehow, and this is coming down the pike and I might as well tell you now, to make sure somehow that some of the young mothers in our church who are in positions where their husbands are dead or gone or terribly sick and not available, that these women, if their families aren't supporting them somehow, that the body of Christ would do what it was supposed to do in regard to that so they can stay home and deal with their kids. That is right. There's other ways to be inaccessible to your kids, though. Some of you dads have a career, and yes, you need to support your family. The Bible says that the one who doesn't provide for his family is worse than an infidel. Infidel. An unbeliever. Should have said that. But you can't con yourself and you can't con me because I know what it's like to be seduced by doing something you like. And I can be seduced real easy by this. I remember when we first moved here, my wife, it was music to her ears when I came home and says, Bonnie, you know, if I wasn't married, I think I'd sleep in that office. She just, that just made her feel so good. My point is this, that some of us who are wrapped up in our careers are not doing it to support our families. We're doing it to support our egos and we're doing it at the expense of our families. And I am in the process right now of doing some very heavy kinds of reassessment of my involvement and my inavailability to my wife and my kids. Maybe that's why this is such an important message to me because it's bouncing right back into my face. I want to say this to you dads who are wrapped up in your career. if your career is making you inaccessible to your kids I challenge you right now to ask yourself is that where God wants you? is that what God's calling you to? obviously there are times that you're called away I don't want to take it back I'm going to start saying all the exceptions and I don't want to take it back I just want you to think about it and I want you to think about the motives you have sometimes when you just get deeper and deeper and deeper. What kind of legacy are you going to leave? You need to do the same thing with your ministries, everybody here. We've got Awana clubs, we've got high school kids, we've got prayer meeting, we've got all sorts of things that you can get involved in. And you know what? If you're a believer, you need to be functioning, you need to be ministering your gift. There's no getting around that. we are a body and we need each other and it needs to be functioning. But sometimes you need to learn to say no. And you need to realize that if I ever ask you to do something that I am going to understand when you say no. And you need to understand something else. That I am not able to take care of you and you are not able to take care of me. So the problem is this. If you keep saying yes, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to keep asking you. you need to check your priorities and decide for yourself what's most important and you need to minister you have to keep doing that you need to keep doing that but I think some of us need to do some very heavy heavy kinds of reassessment of what our priorities really are I'll never forget the time Howard Hendricks was telling the story of a time when he was being called to preach in a conference. And this was going to be one of these nationwide things. I don't know if it was Urbana, but it was something like that where just the greatest speakers from all around the world were coming and this was going to be the greatest thing. And they asked him if he would come and he gave him the date and he says, well, I can't make it that weekend. And he said, why, Mr. Henricks, man alive, we really need you. You're going to be the top guy there and oh man, all these people are going to be there and this wonderful ministry that touched so many lives. Yeah, I said, what are you doing that is so important that you can't be there and he said well I'm going to be playing with my kids that was just music to their ears the reason that was such an indictment to me was because I would have thought of another excuse I would have said I'm busy I've got other appointments and I would have meant my kids but I applaud him for that because not only was he communicating to that person but he was communicating to his kids that they were important and they mattered and he was going to take time out to be with them on purpose. And his ministry continues, folks. His ministry continues. I don't want to single anybody out, but I've learned so much about this kind of thing from one of our elders, Paul Stone. I remember one time we were going visiting on Thursday night and we were trying to figure out who everybody was and I called him and I said, Paul, what are you doing? He says, I'm playing with my kids. And I went, why am I not doing that? Check your priorities, folks. And then have the guts to do something about it and say no sometimes. You know what? I say this at the risk that some of us who always say no will just use this as ammunition to never get involved. Fine. Moms, again, I'm not making any value judgments. I want you to ask the same questions that the men are asking. How much are you gaining with the extra job? How much money are you really making, if that's what it's about? But I couldn't afford this. You know what you can't afford? We can't afford to lose our kids. Not one. There's still other ways. Let's paint a picture of a situation where the parents are there. The parents are at home. They're both sitting there. Let's make it as idyllic as possible. There's a fireplace and dad's sitting there and mom's sitting there and the kids are all around. They're all there. You know what? We can be there and not be there. And I can really relate to this. We can be there and not be there. I want to read you a quote from a book that I was made aware of through, again, Jeff's seminar at Bethel this last week. It says this. In Thorne Wilder's play, Our Town, Emily has died and she chooses to return to her home and observe the day of her 12th birthday. What had happened, she died and she was given the opportunity, all fanciful and stuff, to go back and live one more day and she picked a good day. This was not a bad day. This was a good day. a fun day that she remembers being full of life. And she went back to her 12th birthday, and as she watches the day unfold, she becomes painfully aware that no one really notices what is going on. Everybody's there. No one really talks. No one really communicates. Finally she cries, I can't, I can't go on. It goes too fast. We don't have time to look at one another. We don't have time to talk. Does anybody live their life while they're living? How many times have you talked to somebody and they're looking right over the top of your head? How many times have your kids tugged at your sleeve and you just don't see them? And you never look at them? And you never get down by them? Parents don't provoke your children to see the anger. And the best way to do that is to be inaccessible to them. Don't get near them. Never see them. Never listen to them. Never talk to them. They want so much to talk to you. They want so much to be heard. Do you listen to your kids? I'm trying so hard to learn. it isn't easy they talk different the things they care about are different Eric Hoffer tells a story about a Bavarian peasant woman again from the same book who cared for him month after month for years after his mother died and it was during a time in his life when he was blind and he says this Eric Hoffer says this, and this woman, this Martha, took care of me. She was a big woman with a small head, and this woman, this Martha, must have really loved me, because those eight years of my blindness are in my mind as a happy time. I remember a lot of talk and laughter. I must have talked a great deal, because Martha used to say again and again, you remember, Eric, you said this, and then you said this, and then the time you said this. She remembered everything I said, and all my life I've had the feeling that what I think and what I feel and what I say are worth remembering. She gave me that gift. She loved me. Let me ask you again, Do you listen to your kids? Do you know what they're saying? When we don't, we're inaccessible. Seeding anger. We want so much to raise our kids. We want so much to raise our kids and train our kids. And we have these behaviors we want them to fall into. And they may be important. Proverbs 22.6. Familiar? Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it. I want to explain that verse in a minute, but I want to read another quote. And I know I risk something when I read, because I risk that I might lose you. Please hang on. This book is The Eighth Day of Creation, written by Elizabeth O'Connor. She says this. The primary focus or purpose of the church, and I'll just say family is to help us discover our gifts and in them in this attempt to discover our gifts we face our fears and then we hold ourselves accountable to them so we can enter into the joy of creating a body creating a family we help each other discover our gifts discover our potential discover our possibilities and then when I discover the possibilities in my children and in people here I hold you accountable to live up to those things to pursue those things That's the body. That's the family. The major obligation, I love this, of the church to children is to enjoy them and to listen to them so that each can grow according to the design which is written into his being and emerges only under the care and the warmth of the one who is guiding them. Thank you.
