Open your Bibles with me this morning to Philippians chapter 1, where we have been spending some time in verse 9. If you've been with us at all these last few weeks, you're aware that we're dealing with a prayer by the Apostle Paul, reflecting in the prayer his deepest desire for a group of people that he dearly loves, saying this, verse 9, And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more. Clarified, later on in the verse, he goes on to say, The love that I'm praying would abound in you, I pray would abound in you, in real knowledge and all discernment. What that spoke to us was that this love he is praying would abound in them is not to be naive, it is not to be a gullible thing or blind. Prompting then in us this question, then, what is love? And not just love generally, but specifically, what kind of love is Paul praying would abound in them, and in terms of our application, therefore then in us. We have found over the last couple of weeks two helps in finding answers to that question. Number one was in the specific word that was chosen by Paul in verse 9 for love, agape, And in defining that, two weeks ago, we dealt with that in some detail. Beginning last week, we found some help in another place, 1 Corinthians 13, which is known widely by most of us as the love chapter. Turn with me now to that, 1 Corinthians 13, which we will finish up this morning. Now, what we discovered last week in the first three verses, and just by way of getting some introduction, was that far from a sweet-smelling soliloquy on love, fit for reading at weddings, though it is that, 1 Corinthians 13 is a powerful confrontation on a group of people who were in frightening ways lacking love. So much were they lacking love. Chapter 11, verse 17 of 1 Corinthians says that when you come together as a body like we are here, it is not for the better or for the building, It is for the worse or for the destruction of one another. The problem in Corinth, you see, was that while they were a people moving powerfully in the gifts of the Spirit, while they were a people who had accomplished great things for God, by faith moving mountains, they had missed or maybe just ignored the things that mattered most. what he calls in chapter 12, verse 31, the still more excellent way. Chapter 12 was talking about some excellent ways as Paul in chapter 12 spoke of the gift of prophecy and words of knowledge and gifts of healing and gifts of tongues. But I show you a still more excellent way. You need to know, Corinthians, that even if you do speak with tongues of men and of angels but have not love, you're a noisy gong, a clanging cymbal. The gift of prophecy, wonderful as that is, Knowing all mysteries, having all knowledge, as vital as that is in the body, without love, you're nothing. Even faith that moves mountains without love, giving your body to be burned without love, profits you, profits the body. Nothing. Primary message of those three verses was this. Corinthians, you need to understand in all of your accomplishing great things that it is entirely possible to do good things like speak in tongues, prophesy, move mountains by faith, and yet accomplish nothing good. I would say it this way. The gifts of the Spirit without the fruit of the Spirit is not a work of the Spirit. I'm going to say that again. Think that through. The gifts of the Spirit like tongues, prophecy, mountain-moving faith, without the fruit of the Spirit, things like love, joy, peace, most specifically love, is not a work of the Spirit. Some of you might think that's a bit extreme to say, except what I believe 1 Corinthians 13 is clearly saying is this. The gifts of the Spirit, chapter 12, without the fruit of the Spirit, chapter 13, is nothing. It's as if Paul is saying to these Corinthian believers, you guys have ascended to the heights, tongues of angels no less, and prophecy, and knowing mystery and having knowledge, again, mountain-moving faith, accomplishing great things for God. The problem among you is while you have reached the heights, you have very little depth. And what you need to understand is void of some deeper things of God being worked into your spirit, deeper things like being rooted and grounded in love. Your going to the heights is at best unstable and at worst it is dangerous. Like a skyscraper built higher than the depth of its foundation allows, you may as a person, as a church, as a people, look good for a while going up. Be spectacular and fast. But if your roots do not go deep, if your foundation is not substantial, as the building goes up, as the heights are reached, you as a people, you as a church, Corinthians, will be unstable at best. Dangerous at worst, a skyscraper built like that, unstable at best. Dangerous at worst, thousands could die. Same applies here, Corinthians. I believe with all my heart that the church of Jesus Christ is designed by God to impact the world, to, in this metaphor, ascend, to express, to effect. We have been called by God to storm the gates of hell and the power of the Spirit, Matthew 18. Occupy till I come. But the people of God ascending to those heights without being rooted and grounded in such things as love, rooted and grounded, deep foundations, shooting up, attaining the heights without the depth, unstable at best, dangerous at worst. With that in mind, let's hear the final word from Paul to us, tied in with this prayer of Paul that love might abound. What I just said simply illustrates again the importance of this being part of the fabric of our lives together, abounding love. Not a luxury, a necessity for us to even do the occupying God is calling us to do. Very practical ways. Beginning in verse 4, Paul begins to describe what love looks like. In some ways painfully practical, for love is patient. I'll go through this one quick. Makrothumi is the Greek word there. It's a compound word. Makro means long to. thumia is a Greek word for anger thumos even sounds kind of explosive thumos is explosive anger patience is long to explosive anger I try to figure out what this looks like and I kind of get this initial impression that if I was patient and if I had enough love I would be patient and that means that on 694 at 6 o'clock in the afternoon on the way home from work when there's an accident two miles ahead and I'm stopped and my air conditioner's broke oh it's okay oh and the guy next to me is looking at me with this stupid grin on my face going what are you so happy about and i go it's love it's just love okay well maybe someday but you know what there's something deeper than that i hope and even if i'm not doing real well in my car, the worst damage I'm going to do there is to my steering wheel or to myself. This is a patience. Enter into this now. This is a patience that is speaking of my interactions with people. And there is where I do my damage. I think the embodiment of the concept of patience, makrothumi, long to anger, is found in James 1.19, where James the Apostle says, beloved, let every one of you hear this, be quick to listen and slow to speak. And in that, quick to listen and slow to speak, you'll be slow to anger. Don't decide so quick. Think on that, just that little flow of that. All of a sudden, I mean, my concept of love as it relates to patience starts to spread out a little bit. You know, sometimes love is as practical as slowing down a little bit. Sometimes love is as practical as waiting for people, listening to what they say before you decide. This one does land on me hard, and then this one might land on you hard. Others might land on you harder than they land on me, but I'm a hundred miles an hour kind of person. I don't know if this is a surprise to you, but I am. And then, you know, I even have to do work sometimes in a text to hear something. In this James 119, I did a little trick with it. It helped me a lot. It's like, the way I hear it is this. Somebody's saying to me, hey Dave, Dave, hurry up and listen. And I, you know, I hear, I do that really well. I respond, hurry up. I go, okay, okay, hurry up and listen. And hurry, I'm so, hurry up and, hurry up and slow down. The hurry up gets me. Okay. And listen, slow down. Hurry up and listen. I'm hurrying up and doing this. Stop. Hold on. Slow down. I am not a quick to listen kind of person. And again, I'm sure it won't come as a surprise to you, but even in arenas, they don't make any difference. They don't really hurt people. But I manifest this quick to act thing. And feature me, just for a moment, fixing a car. Now, that's an impossible picture because it'll never happen. It'll never happen. Barbecue. I'm putting together our barbecue. Or I'm putting together the kid's bike. Or I'm helping my wife hang a curtain rod. I hate that job. I hate that job. Holes all through our house. In the wall. They never fit. But see, that's what I do. I do well. I look at the instructions. I look at them and go, yeah, okay. And I'm doing fine until this part doesn't fit. The screw doesn't go in. It breaks. It falls off. And then basically what I do is I slow down. I back up, read the directions. No, I don't. I jam it. I force it. I smash it. I throw it. Then I bless you, curtain. I'm doing something in the garage, and then that happens. Invariably, that happens. The part doesn't fit. I jam it, smash it, force it, throw it. My yelling finally subsides to muttering. My wife cracks the door in the garage. The glimmer in her eye delights in saying, Dave, did you read the directions? I'll give you directions. I'll give you directions. I know how to do this. Now, here's the deal. When I'm building a barbecue, it doesn't cost very much when I act like that. It costs me a new barbecue. But I really can deal with that. But if I deal with people like that, it costs a lot more. If you deal with people like that, it costs a lot more. Be quick to listen, slow to speak, thereby being slow to anger. These words, as they come, I hope elicits in you a sense of slowing down and wondering. Like I do with this one. I wonder, what is it about quick to speak and slow to hear in me that works? Because it has to work or I wouldn't do it. You understand? It works for me, this quick to speak. Don't listen. Okay, I don't know. I've heard enough. Okay, fine. I decide. Well, that is what works for me. The thing is that dawns on me about quick anger and quick speech is that quick anger and speech decides. It settles it. It's everything solved when I can do it quick. And the result of that is this. The payoff of that is this. I don't have to engage the people I'm in a relationship with. I don't have to feel what they're feeling. I don't have to hear them. I don't have to consider them anymore. I've decided. I know. That's enough. I've decided. And deciding even looks kind of decisive. I don't have to be confused anymore with quick speech and slow hearing. I don't have to be bewildered at all about another point of view. I don't have to be troubled at all with another possibility. I can keep things simple by not listening and quickly speaking. That's the payoff. Quick anger and quick speech may be wrong. in the decision. But you know what I notice? It hardly ever looks weak. I hate looking weak. I'd rather be wrong. Makes me wonder what I am protecting with my quick to speech and my quick to anger. Makes me wonder about that. Makes me want to bring it to God and say, God, work this in me. Quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. Love is patient. Hurry up and listen. Love is kind. I touched briefly on this last week. By faith, Corinthians, you moved mountains, but what I want to know is were you kind? The prophets, the seers, and the knowers, if they are anything, they are right, right? as the prophets speak the knowers know the solvers they're right they're all sorts of right what i wanted to know is in your being right were you kind being right is an incredible powerful to incredibly powerful tool and you can use it to destroy people i want to know if in your truth knowing you were kind because if you weren't all of your truth was nothing love is kind the word itself I think stirs things in us that help us understand it but simply defined kindness is gentle it's good willed, gracious, sympathetic and benevolent maybe one of the best ways that I get to kindness is beyond the behavior of kindness kindness comes from being free enough from myself and my obsession with me to notice you. It occurs to me that if I am absolutely obsessed with me, I don't even notice you, let alone be kind to you. I've got to somehow get free from myself enough to notice. Oh, there's somebody down there that might have in me. One of the struggles I think some of us have with kindness, even not verbalizing it, it was one of the struggles I noticed I bumped into this week, is I think there's a way in which we're afraid of kindness. Explain what I mean by that. I think some of us are afraid of it because many of us define it as mush. Kindness is that dynamic, especially in a tough situation, family situation possibly, where I have had to take a hard stand and quite frankly in love, take a hard stand and have a firm no and have a clear boundary as an expression of love to do that. You put kindness, My definition of kindness is mush. And all of a sudden, this word of kindness is going to dissolve my resolve. Because we define kindness as mush. I would like you to consider the possibility that kindness without firmness isn't kindness. Dan Allender, in his book Bold Love, which, by the way, I highly recommend. I'm not going to be mentioning this book much more. Right now I want to put my finger on it and tell you, especially if you'd like to go deeper in some of the troubling aspects of love, especially in painful kinds of relationships. Dan Allender, bold love, very helpful. Things like, how do you love an enemy? How do you love an evil person? How do you love an ignorant person? How do you love a simple sinner? Powerful help. Giving you a tool right there. In his book, among other things, he cites a man whose father tore him to shreds emotionally for three decades. He got married, did the son, brought this young bride into the family. The father then turned his rage on her as well. In the name of turning the other cheek, patience and kindness, this son did nothing to confront his father about his abuse toward himself or toward his wife. Again, in the name of patience and kindness, did he this. Allender goes on to point out the fact that that behavior is neither patient nor kind. What that is is cowardly. For the kind act there, obviously, toward his wife would be to stand between and protect her from his rage. The kind thing, however, also for his father who is embroiled in this evil spilling forth from him, the kindest thing he could ever get would be a gift of no, this isn't going to work anymore. Usually what gives us the courage or the energy to finally bring a no is that we are so enraged, literally murder is in our heart. Kindness and firmness are things we find alien. They are not. In fact, kindness without firmness isn't kindness. Let me illustrate that another way. In fact, this is using the same terminology. Paul Houck, in a book called Rational Management of Children, cites four parenting styles that feed right into this. The first style he calls kind and firm. In fact, that's where I got this kind of paradigm here. It's kind and firm. And in a family that's kind and firm, you've got children who know the rules, the boundaries are clear, the consequences are consistent, and you know what? Expectations are high. You know what? High expectations are not a... I believe in you, kid. I got high expectations for you, and I'm going to do those within the parameters of what you're capable for. I got high expectations for you. And those parameters and rules and consequences and expectations, firm, or in a context of, I value you, I love you, kind. People in contexts like that, whether it be a family or a church, grow. They find safety, they find parameters, they find consequences that are normal, they find love all over the place. People grow in that. Another parenting style is unkind and firm. I say that dynamic and some of you have things stirring you that remind you of your home. This is the staff sergeant who, according to Houck, produces high performing. And they perform highly because the rules were clear. The expectations were high. There wasn't any kindness, though. And so they perform really well. He calls them high performing neurotics. And the word neurotic always seems to produce a chuckle in us. But the pain of that person is great because it's never enough and it's never enough and it's never enough. And that's what unkindness with firmness produces. There's another style. It's called kindness and unfirmness. So you've got all sorts of warm and gooey, but you don't have any clear parameters, very low expectations. Do what you want. Oh, yeah. Producing, instead of scared, inferior children, people, not only children, but if this is the way a church is. See, churches, these are systems, not just families. But you have people who set their own rules up. They are the spoiled brats of the world, he says. They are what he calls the whiners of the world, who believe at their core. Never verbalizing this, but in terms of their core belief, the entire universe revolves around them. Final form or kind of family system or system is unkind and unfirm, where the rules keep changing. The punishments for behaviors over here were okay, and now they're not. Not only are they inconsistent and confusing, but when they come, they're mean, unpredictable. And some of you who've grown up in alcoholic families know that kind of dynamic very well. The fact is this. Kindness without firmness is not kindness. But love is kind. Whatever else it is, it's kind. It isn't jealous. Next one, it doesn't brag and it isn't arrogant. Now I put all those together because they are, in my view, opposite ends of the same issue. Listen and think with me on this. Both jealousy and arrogance operate from the same core belief. And the core belief of the jealous person and the arrogant person is this. There is something that I can acquire. There is something that I can attain. There is something that I can accomplish. And when I acquire it, attain it, or accomplish it, I will by that be made okay. Follow that thought through the jealous person. The jealous person doesn't have it. Whatever it is he's decided he or she has to have, accomplish, or attain to be okay, this person doesn't have it. But believe that if I did, I'd be okay. and all of the juice of their life is in moving toward that thing and sometimes the jealousy of desiring that thing, accomplishment, conquest, whatever it may be, slips into something else. Not only do I want it for me, but it really irritates me that you have it, that you have attained it, that you have accomplished it, and I wish you ill because you do. Shakespeare calls that the green sickness. It is the enemy of honor, the sorrow of fools. Jealousy has no ability to rejoice with those who rejoice because you have it, and I don't. Arrogance has the same core belief as jealousy. In fact, I think jealousy, when it gets what it thinks it needed to get to be okay, becomes arrogant. Think on that. See, arrogance has just simply come to the place where he or she has acquired, accomplished, or attained what they thought they had to have to be okay. And when they get it, they believe that by acquiring it, attaining it, conquering it, they are now okay. In fact, they're better than you. Now, I don't think you have to live very long to understand something about arrogant people and jealous people. It's this. And if you're an arrogant, jealous person, it's an embarrassment for you because you've got a neon sign on you. And what it says is this. I am, at the core, an empty person who is desperately trying to fill myself with things that cannot fill me. In fact, the person who has finally attained the things he thought he had to have to be okay and now brags is, by the very bragging, screaming, it didn't work. I'm still trying to fill myself with your approval of what I now have or have done. Empty trucks make the most noise. You ever hear that one? Here's the deal about jealousy and arrogance and the core belief that feeds that. Things we acquire, things we attain, and things we accomplish do not have the power to fill us. But as long as we believe they do, we will pursue them. And as long as we are spending the energies of our life pursuing these things to make us okay, we will not love. Do you know why? It's simply this. For in the pursuit of things and acquisitions and status that we believe will make us okay when we get it, we are in that pursuit totally consumed and obsessed with ourselves. and when you're here I don't even notice you you don't even exist except maybe for me to use to acquire what I have to have to be okay if in fact jealousy rages in you and arrogance comes from you what I know is that telling you not to be jealous and not to be arrogant won't do much good hopefully a word like this, however, will cause you to look inside and wonder, what is that about? Ask questions like this as this embarrassing arrogance comes from me. And you know what? Especially if you're a child of God, it does embarrass you. You walk away from a conversation when you went and you go, oh, does that taste lousy? that it would raise up in you a question that says, Dave, what have I, without even knowing it, begun to try to get my, I've begun to act like I could get my life from that. Do some work around that. Jeremiah 2.13 says, My people have committed two evils. Number one, they have forsaken me as the source of life and begun to believe that other things could give it. I am the fountain of living water. The second thing they've done is after forsaking me as the source, the thing that can fill them and make them okay and feel good about who they are inside, me being the source, instead of that they have gone to dig for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that hold no water. And if you want to know if you're pursuing things in life that would be right in Jeremiah 2.13, digging for yourselves wells, broken wells that hold no water, if you want to know if you're doing that, Check your spirit for jealousy, because if you're doing that, you will be jealous. Because somebody else's cistern will be better than yours. It means you get your life from that. Jealousy. If only I had that cistern. Arrogance. I am quite the cistern builder, aren't I? Yeah, and it leaks. love doesn't act unbecomingly verse 5 it doesn't seek its own pull that together this is what it says love isn't rude i didn't know this would get this down to earth love isn't rude ah you know again i gotta be i gotta go at home i gotta go home with this stuff you know this isn't just church I've got to be at home with this. And first thing you think, well, come on, love isn't rude. I mean, what is it? Love is not eating with your mouth full. Love is not burping at the table. You know, I mean, in some, well, maybe, maybe. And I'm going to tell you, there is a maybe around that, that there are times that is clearly a loveless act. But for some of you, I just gave a tool for some people in your family who aren't loving at all, and they would like to, well, so when you make a mistake and you burp at the table, All of a sudden, what if you breathe? You must not love. All of a sudden, a burp is about love. You know, oh, my. Something in here is, you've got to work around this. You know, in our family, around the table, four kids, five if you count me, we have table rules. And if you break one of the rules, you get a chore. In fact, you know, two or three times during the meal, the delightful thing, the delightful thing is the kids go, chore, chore. You know, we're checking up on each other. Things like, you know, burping and talking with your mouth full. I don't know where this one came from, but like mashing food through your teeth, things like that. Not okay. You get a chore. Appropriate language. But you know what? The fact is this. Some of the most hilarious times and memorable we've ever had as a family have been at that table with our rules, and somebody, sometimes by accident, sometimes with a twinkle in their eye, breaks a rule. Sometimes it turns into a contest. How big can we break the rule? How much noise can you make? And in certain times, it's just a riot. And I would hate to have a thing like this come down on that and go, our table turned into this cold, appropriate... I'd hate that to happen here. There's a way in which we at the table here, coming to worship, come as we are, and the kids make their noise, and the marbles fall on the floor, and it's what happens in families. But there is a rudeness that speaks of lovelessness, and all of the same behaviors could be there. It could be, oh, I'm getting gross here. It could be a burp that's loveless. What a loveless burp. It's this that deep in my core, the spirit and approach of my life in interacting with people is this. Nobody really matters in this family or in this church but me. The only one here is me. So the only thing that matters is what I want and what I need and what I feel like doing. Somebody should do what I feel like. That's rude. That's loveless. Love has the capacity to get every once in a while outside itself and just consider how the behavior I'm doing might bump into you. The fact is this, cutting someone off in traffic could be a mistake. You didn't see them. There is no big, you didn't love. There's nothing like, you made a mistake. But I think you know, as well as I do, that there are times when cutting someone off in traffic is an act of lovelessness. It's a big deal. Because deep in your soul, raging in your spirit, is one primary core belief. Nobody on this earth matters more than me. Get out of my way. This is mine. Love isn't rude. That is loveless. It's more than an obnoxious behavior. It's loveless. And you may be on your way to an appointment at church. And the decisions you make there might have incredible impact in the kingdom. But if you have this belief about yourself that what you think and what you want is all that matters, what you do is nothing. You know, I don't know how much I want to meddle. I've already meddled enough here. But I'm going to meddle. I mean, you know, there's times I'm late to an appointment, and the reason I'm late is because I got held up. And there's lots of room to be late. You know, I'm going to be so picky. You know that there's times when I'm late, and the reason I'm late is because, you know what, the only schedule that really matters is mine. It's loveless. It's not having an ability to get outside myself and realize I'm not the only one in the universe. There are other people impacted by what I do and what I don't. Love isn't rude. love doesn't take into account a wrong suffered when we say that doesn't take into account a wrong suffered it does not mean we do not hold people accountable love that I think we've established over these last five weeks in the series does, real love does hold people accountable and does confront people for sin when it says love doesn't take into account a wrong suffered what i believe that means is this it is speaking to people who take into account who long after genuine repentance has been made on the part of the person who offended you you never let them off the hook literally you bank their offense you put it into account you put it into your account they have apologized i'm not talking about a phony forgiveness. I'm not talking about a shallow repentance that you know they did, but genuine repentance has come. But you have taken that and stuck it in the bank, and I am never letting that out. I offer a token, sure, I forgive you, but I have this person in prison for the rest of their life, and in that I find incredible power. You ever have somebody stick your offense of them even after you genuinely repented into an account and keep you there? Ever have that happen to you? There's nothing you can do to get out. A recent ministry opportunity, I was speaking with one of the pastors and getting to know a number of the people in the church. I came to know in that process a woman in her mid-60s who had been on staff in that church working with the children, a godly woman marked by, as I observed, her dignity and grace. One day I was talking with the pastor about a number of people, and he shared with me that this woman was a wonderful demonstration of God's grace in her life. In her early 20s, she had already been married. She wasn't a Christian at the time, though Christians do make this kind of mistake. She wasn't a Christian at the time. She had an affair. Broken by her sin, she, in the subsequent events following that, came to know Jesus, and since that time had been growing in grace. Her husband, a shallow, petty man, said at the time, a token, I forgive you. But for the next 40-some years of their marriage, he punished her and punished her and punished her for that mistake she did in her early 20s. Punishing her with a separateness, never separating physically, at least not from the house. in the house they would be separate, punishing her by being aloof, superior, unengaged. What that is, is putting into your account a wrong suffered. And here's the deal. Love doesn't do that. Love just doesn't do that. You know what? I don't care if you speak in tongues, and I don't care if you prophecy, and I don't care if you move mountains. If people come to you and repent, and you put that into the account and never let it out, save the tongues and save your prophecy and work on that. Love does not rejoice in sin, verse 6, but rejoices in the truth. Simply put, this says, Love takes no joy in sin but doesn't ignore it either. Love takes no joy in sin but doesn't ignore it either. Romans 1.32 speaks of people who give hearty approval to those who practice sin. You know, I try to envision that, giving hearty approval, rejoicing, having a little joy in my heart over somebody else's sin. Why would somebody do that? I thought of two reasons. Number one, I might rejoice in somebody else's sin because it paves the way for mine. You follow that? It gives me permission. In their sin, I find permission to do what I want to do too. So that would cause me to rejoice in someone's sin, but it also reveals something about my heart. Another reason you might rejoice in someone's sin has another face entirely. And my rejoicing in sin in this dynamic would be my rejoicing in your sin because I don't do that sin, and by you falling in that sin, I feel by that superior. Rejoicing in sin that way sounds like this. You'll never guess who we need to pray for and why. The loving response, the alive to God response to sin is always heartache. Whether it be sin in me or sin in you. And the reason for that is because sin always diminishes. Sin always wounds ultimately. Sin always separates people. Sin always steals something of my humanity. And ultimately, what sin does is kill. And love takes no delight in that. None. Love bears all things, verse 7. Bears all things is actually a poor translation. It communicates kind of carrying something. And that's not what it means. The Greek word is stege. And it means to shelter, protect, or cover. literally to clothe someone in their nakedness. There is a clothing, there is a covering that would cause us to or make us think we're talking about covering maybe sin and hiding sin. That is not what stay gay is. It has nothing to do with ignoring or hiding sin. It has everything to do with protecting the dignity of the person. In fact, real love would go to someone you really loved, away from the sight of everybody, who does not need to see this person's nakedness because they just have done something naked. They have done something wrong. And it goes to the side and says, I care about you, but what you did was wrong. But even as I expose that, I cover you. Have any of you ever been confronted like that? Have any of you ever been confronted like this? Hey, look at that! have any of you been covered like that and in the uncovering in the unloving way what they are uncovering in you is true you really are guilty you really did do it they really are right but they didn't cover you and something more than your sin now is being dealt with and exposed something at the core of your humanity is being humiliated and repentance is even hard to do in that kind of context love does not ignore sin when love sees sin in a brother or a sister it goes to that one and covers them at the same time they're exposing the problem Galatians 6.1 says it this way better than I've just said it if a brother or a sister stumbles you who are spiritual go to them and here's what you do, restore them they have fallen they are bleeding they are going to suffer consequences for their falling in fact you can see them their knees or skin they don't think they're ever going to run again. They don't think they'll ever get in the race again. You who are spiritual, go and restore them. How? In a spirit of gentleness. I think the spirit of gentleness is what stay gay is about. Love covering or clothing them. They will have consequences for sin. We are not hiding the fact that they fell. We are not denying the fact that it is sin. But we are going to put around our brother and sister that we love a cloak of dignity. and find no joy in humiliating them so that one day those wounds will heal as repentance comes and healing comes and one day they will run again. Love does not ignore, deny, or look away from someone who stumbles but covers, protects, and clothes even while we intervene. Loveless people take great delight in uncovering, exposing, and revealing. And sometimes they even do it in the name of rejoicing in the truth. I told the truth. And you humiliated the person. And love doesn't do that. Last one. Not a lot of time to develop this. Love believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love hopes all things. obviously had some work around it. I mean, this is not divine gullibility. It hopes all things. I mean, the first picture I had was somebody sitting there going, ooh, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope. Against all reality. I hope, I hope, I hope. This is not the white queen in Alice in Wonderland saying, I sometimes believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast. This is not the stubborn belief that this person who doesn't love me someday will. I just know. I just know they will. You don't have control over what they're going to do. You do not have that much power. You do not know that. This is not a call to hope in that. You don't know that. That would be nice. Then what is the hope in? Maybe this is what it means. That even though you, that even though we have seen clearly and felt deeply how circumstances and people can disappoint, betray, and hurt us, even feeling that deeply and seeing that clearly, we do not abandon hope in, not necessarily them, but in the more excellent way. I do not abandon hope in the fact that love and keeping my heart tender and keeping my heart open and keeping my heart accessible and tender and reachable is still the way I choose to live. I will not by bitterness and rage be protected. I will not by hardness be fed. Love does not abandon hope in the fact that love still has incredible power. And I make a choice, and I ask by the Spirit, God, even though I've been wounded, keep my heart tender and keep my heart open and keep my love alive, even if all I've got right now is just a heartbeat. And with all of that pulled together, I draw you now back to Philippians chapter 1, verse 9. For this is what I'm praying for you, that your love may abound, that patience may abound, that kindness may abound, that jealousy and arrogance be put away, that rudeness be seen as what it is, sometimes loveless, to take a look at that and that abound, to recognize that how we behave has a ripple effect on people around us, that love does not take into account a wrong suffered, it doesn't stick people in the bank forever, it takes no joy in sin, it protects people's dignity and it continually hopes and finds confidence in the power of the love of God in the church in my spirit to the body and this I pray that our love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment of what love really is and with those words I wrap up the time we've spent on love, but we are not done with Paul's prayer. Next week, we will move on into verse 10 and 11. I'd like you to stand with me as we close with some instructions for closing. This morning, I'm going to ask the altar ministry to come and meet people who would come for prayer. Invite those of you who may be moved for prayer in light of what I said, but more and more we are aware of the fact that people have the Spirit of God work in their hearts in areas that aren't necessarily connected to the Word I said. Last night, someone got saved. I wasn't talking about that. And the Spirit of God is active for many things. We want you to know the altar ministry is up here to receive you, but we're going to wrap this with a song. And I'd like to pray, and then you sing that. As we sing, I'd like the altar ministry to come. Jesus, I thank you for the things you've been speaking to us about love. I thank you for the fact that by your spirit and some choices we make, it can in us abound. And I pray, as we have been praying for several weeks, that far beyond the end of this series, that these things would be rippling through us and affecting us and making this a safer, more enjoyable, wonderful place to be as a body. I pray these things upon us in Jesus' name. Amen.
