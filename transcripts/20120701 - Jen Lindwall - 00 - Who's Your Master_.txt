Good morning, it's great to see all of you. My name is Jen Linwall. I'm on staff here and I have the privilege of doing the message this morning. So let's pray as we dive into the word. God, we always ask for the eyes to see and the ears to hear and the feet to walk and follow you. And so this morning, I pray especially that we will be aware of the work of your spirit that is already happening in us and that you will pull back the veil so we can see it and so that we can join you in it. Pray this in the name of Christ, amen. Well, open your Bibles, if you have them, to Colossians 3, which should be very familiar by now. Steve has been talking about children and parents the last three weeks, and I recommend you definitely check those out if you missed them. Today we're going to be moving on, and we're going to start in verse 22, Colossians 3. Paul says this, Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, and do it not only when their eye is on you, and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, Since you know that you're receiving inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It's the Lord Christ you are serving. What is your first response to that text, honestly? Because mine is, what? What is he talking about? Is Paul actually telling a group of people that are enslaved to obey their master in everything? Doesn't that go against pretty much everything Paul has said? A couple verses before this, he said, now in Christ, there is no slaver free. And that's a theme throughout his letters. We read in Philemon that there's a slave named Onesimus, and Paul calls him his very heart. He calls him his son, and he seems desperate for his release. But Paul is very direct in this. He doesn't mince words here. Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything. Everything, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. Now, when we hear the word slave, many of us probably have a similar image come to our mind. We think of the slave trade. We think of people in chains being beaten and abused, not being given their basic needs, living in total poverty. Or maybe we think of modern-day slavery. We think of sex trafficking. And those horrible images make this set of verses seem even crazier. But we have to really know who Paul is talking to in these verses. The Greek word for slaves here is doulos. And it's literally translated as someone who belongs to another or is without rights of their own. There was no separate word in the Greek for slave or for servant. So doulos addresses anyone who is bound in service to another person. And it's estimated that up to a third of the population in this time were doulos, were slaves or servants. Every wealthy household in the empire had slaves, had servants. And historians have differing opinions on this, but most of them believe that these people were actually treated pretty fairly. They were given a livable wage, and they could be doctors, they could be accountants, they could perform any number of duties for these households. And some of them were so valuable to their masters that the masters treated them really well because they wanted them to stay happy, and they wanted them to stay and perform their duties in that household. That's not to defend the practice of slavery, not in any way. but just to set the record straight about what the cultural practice was in that time, in the first century. Still, these slaves were not free. They didn't have, you know, all the rights. They weren't seen as significant members of society. They didn't get to choose how to spend their days. They couldn't leave their job if they wanted to. Their value was really determined by their ability to get the job done. And so the fact that Paul was talking to this group of people is really countercultural because as a group, they were seen as a commodity, not as individual people. And based on their status in society, they wouldn't have been in a church service. They wouldn't have been in a community of people, in a synagogue. And so it's amazing to think that as Paul wrote this letter, he assumed that they would be there when it was read. And he addresses as masters a couple verses down. So was it like slave, master, slave, master? I mean, all together in one room? That would have been completely unheard of in their day. And it makes me wonder how subversive and countercultural the early church really was in its practices. So the slaves are there, maybe, we can assume, and this letter is being read out loud. And it says wives, husbands, children, parents, and then the word slaves. And I can almost hear like this hush whispering in the room. Did he just say slaves? I think he just said slaves. What is Paul gonna say to slaves? To the group of people in the room who are in a relationship that may be unfair, that may be unjust, that they can't control, and that is dominating their every single day. I have something to say to you. Paul says. Now let's stop right there. Would Paul be talking to anyone in this room? Are any of you not free to do exactly what you want to do when you want to do it? Are any of you subject to something outside of your control in your life? I have a friend who just went through the long process of watching his mother's health deteriorate, and her health was so bad that it required doctor's visit after doctor's visit, and then this long, brutal time in hospice care. and he was subject to his mom and her health. Every day he would wake up and what he was to do that day was determined by her and what she needed. If you're a caregiver for anyone, a young child, an aging parent, a sick sibling, a mentally ill friend, a child with special needs, you often feel like you aren't free to do what you want to do. Mealtimes at our house, I usually cannot count the amount of times that my husband and I get up to get our two or four-year-old something. They think of the most ridiculous things that they need in that moment, and there will be no peace until they have it. And I sometimes feel like I never get to do what I want when I want. I don't get to eat when I want. I don't get to sleep when I want. These two little people literally are dictating pretty much every moment of every day of my life. So for you, what keeps you from living life exactly as you want. Maybe you're thinking of your job right now. You have this boss who just gives you thing after thing after thing. And you have to do it because you need a job. Because you bought a house six years ago and took out a mortgage that they told you you'd be able to pay back when you sold your house and made money. But now you're $100,000 upside down on your mortgage, right? And so you have to keep doing this job so you have a place to live. And so you have to do all these things that your boss is giving you. You have no choice. Maybe it's the balance in your bank account. You sign on to wellsfargo.com, you see that number, and you think there is no way that is going to pay for the things that we need this month. And so your entire life is determined by getting that number to increase in whatever way you can. Or maybe you step on a scale every morning, and if you don't see a couple numbers right there, the rest of your day is set for you. what you're going to eat, how you're going to think about yourself, how you're going to talk to yourself, how far and how fast you're going to run. Maybe you're 15 or you're 20, and you just realize that your family is not perfect, and you need a new family in order to live. And so every day, you're trapped in this place where all you can think about is how dysfunctional your family really is and how much you need to get free from that. Maybe you're sick, and now instead of being able to do what you want when you want, you have to go to chemo. And anytime your doctor wants you to change something or do something, you have to do it. You have no choice. There are a lot of circumstantial things that happen in our lives that make us unable to control our day in and day out life. Is it possible that these circumstances are our earthly masters? And I know we don't think of circumstances as masters, but what really controls your schedule and your life? What actually controls your life? What keeps you from living the life you want and forces you to do something else? Could that thing or those things be your master? And this isn't good or bad, this just is. I have a friend and I met him because he used to be the CEO of this really incredible non-profit that we partner with. And he's one of those guys that you meet with him the first time and you just, you want him to be your grandpa or your uncle. You just want to hug him right away. Just so incredible, but also so down to earth and so normal and accessible. And in a loving marriage, two grown boys, a grandson when I met him, he was living in Minneapolis with his wife who was also a working professional. He loved the work of his organization, and he got to do all these great things as a result, teaching and consulting, just an incredible guy. And all of a sudden, a couple years ago, something strange started happening with his wife. She would call him, and she'd be near their house, and she would be lost. She'd be on Highway 94, near where they lived, and she wouldn't know where she was. Or something would happen, and then a moment later, she would forget that it had happened. Or she would try to do something she'd been doing for years, like clean out the refrigerator, and she'd take everything out and couldn't put it back in. And so they went to the doctor, and at first they thought it was just psychological, and so they were trying to treat it with some medication. But after more tests and more doctor's visits, she was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's at the age of 52 years old, a disease from which there is no cure. So my friend was told by a doctor, you are going to watch this person that you love slip away from you. And she is gonna forget who you are. And you're gonna have a front row seat to that whole thing. I remember hearing that story and thinking, that's crazy. You know those times in your life where you really wanna go to God and say, I have something to say to you. That's not fair. That's not fair. No one should have to go through that. He should not have to go through that of all people, but still, here he was, here his wife was in this situation. And once she was diagnosed and had to quit her job, they had to sell their house, and he needed to quit his job as well so he could be more available to her. And so they moved into an assisted living complex where they are the youngest people by far and where she can be cared for in the way that she needs to. But because he quit his job, they needed some additional income. And so he talked to the facility and they brought him on as a caretaker part-time. And one of his duties is to vacuum a couple times a week for the afternoon. Now I want you to picture this. We are talking about a brilliant person, a former CEO consultant teacher who is spending large chunks of time vacuuming the hallway at the assisted living complex that he lives in and where he is gonna live for a long time. His life is still with doctor's visits and total attentiveness to his wife and her needs and complete uncertainty about how her disease is gonna shift and change over time. You wanna feel, you wanna talk about feeling like you have no control over your life. Like there's some thing on earth that is mastering you, that is dictating your every single day and you have little to no say about it. I would have a lot of things to say if that was my situation. And you probably would too. And so does my friend Tom. He said this has been a time of joy and incredible growth and laughter for them. Has there been sorrow? Yes. And grieving? Yes. And tears? Yes. When they first got diagnosed, they said they went to their car, they cried, they held each other, and then they went and got the biggest Dairy Queen blizzards that they could get and ate them all. And she said that if she could have gotten a bigger one, she would have. It's been a hard time. But it's incredible to hear how he's experiencing this. He said he's seen a growth and change in him that he didn't think was possible. He actually looks forward to vacuuming each week because it's this chunk of time that gives him an opportunity to see the world from a different angle than he ever did as a CEO. I mean, that is incredible. He's looking for ways to be fully present to his wife, to really listen when she talks and to wait and give her the space and time she needs to form her thoughts. Unbelievable. I watched this video of them speaking to some health professionals, and they're so funny. I mean, they're making, like, inappropriate jokes about Alzheimer's and about how they're walking it out. I laughed, I cried. He is gentle, and he is honest, and he is true and kind and generous and funny, and everybody that I know who knows him experiences him in a similar way. How in the world is this happening in the life of a person, a real person that I know, who, yeah, is incredible, but is also a normal human being? Is it possible to confront the reality of what masters you hear on earth but then live beyond it? Tom is doing it, so it has to be possible. And I think we first have to get honest about what our masters are. We have to recognize what they are, and then we have to speak them out loud to people we trust. And for Tom, it's kind of obvious. For some of you, you might know right away what it is. It might be really obvious. And for others, maybe you're kind of trying to discern what your masters are. But have you said out loud to anyone what actually controls your life? Would you be willing to do that? Part of what Paul is doing here is speaking the reality of these slaves out into community. He's saying what's true. You are slaves. You have masters. That is what is. Do you think anyone was talking to them about what it meant to be a slave? Like they're receiving some kind of life coaching or counseling about how do you do soul care in the midst of slavery or how do you walk this out in a healthy way? No way. This is a thing that you just don't talk about. You just grin and bear it and get through. Just tolerate it at the best. But Paul has something to say about it. And he is dedicating four times as many verses to talk to the slaves than he did to wives, husbands, children, and parents. He goes into detail about how to walk this out. For this part of your life, I have something to say. Slaves. And let's take a step back and remember the context of these verses, because we have been in them for so long. But remember, this started by Paul saying, let everything you say and everything you do be in the name of Christ. And then he kind of goes on this run of what that would look like. So this is kind of my paraphrase of this chunk. Paul is saying, you know what, this is not about polite handshakes on a Sunday morning or smiling at each other in the gathering place. This is about your whole life. So husbands, don't be jerks. Wives, don't try to dominate your husbands. And kids, take off your headphones and listen to your parents. But parents, don't try to control your kids just because you can. And slaves, don't try to kiss up to your master and then just stab him behind the back. I mean, don't spend all your energy, you know, just sucking up, but really, you're just trying to get even. No one deserves to be treated that way, and that's not the kind of people that you are anyway. That's not who we are as followers of Christ. I was in Trader Joe's a couple months ago, and they have those little carts there that my kids love, and it is like a demolition derby once they get their hands on those carts. And so honestly, usually I end up at the checkout, sweating and a little frustrated, and trying to keep my kids from biting through the dark chocolate bars that they have there. If you ever see teeth marks in them, it's probably my kids. So this one day, I was there, I was checking something on my phone, and I was kind of like with one hand just trying to keep them from, you know, destroying anything. And the guy at the checkout said, oh, hi, Jen, right? I go to Open Door, and I've never met you, but I'm so-and-so. And all of a sudden, I found myself, you know, in this space with complete capacity to be a patient, loving mother and attentive. And, you know, I was just telling him what I was checking on my phone. It was like, I had to do it right now. Like, I couldn't even have waited five minutes, because, you know, the world was going to explode if I didn't know right now what this thing was or what it said. Isn't it interesting how easily we can find what we need to do hard things when it's in our best interest? I mean, don't we all know what it feels like to do something to get the favor of others? It's a really normal experience. And, you know, we have these big masters in our life, and then we have these little masters that kind of change day to day or moment to moment. But anything that is outside of us that is controlling us or dictating how we behave is a master to us. It's an earthly master. And so we have to be able to identify those and then to understand how we're relating to our masters. So how are you responding to the things in your life that are controlling you? Are you faking it? Are you just grinning and bearing it? Are you pretending all is well, but deep down, you're so angry and you're so resentful? You can't compartmentalize your life in Christ into one role you play or into two roles that you play. It's about your whole life because if something is affecting the part of you or a moment of your day, it's affecting all of you. It's affecting the whole. Paul says, do and say it all in the name of Christ. I cannot get groceries at Trader Joe's in the name of Christ. which is a scary thought. It's so easy to put whatever is mastering us in this sort of separate category though apart from that life in Christ. Whether it's this role we have caregiving or this image we're trying to manage or this scary number on our bank account. We put it into these categories like things I'm gonna fix, things that I'm gonna pretend aren't real, things that are keeping me from living the way I wanna live. And we have these strategies that we use, because we're afraid to have a master, and we don't want to talk about what it's like to have a master. What would it be like to integrate the whole of your life in a way that felt congruent, and like the parts of you actually made up the whole of you? What do you think would have happened at Trader Joe's if I had simply looked up and said, wow, I was just totally distracted, and thanks so much for kind of bringing me back to reality? It probably would not have been any different for him. I don't think he cared or was paying attention, but do you think it would have felt different for me? Would that have felt more congruent and real to me? I think that's part of what Paul is getting at when he says do and say it all in the name of Christ. And this is really hard for us to do. We don't categorize things because we're horrible people or because we really want to be fake or because we want our aging parent to die or our kid to grow up. We do it because we cling to the belief that if things out here would change, things in here would change. And living subject to someone or something else is really, really scary. And so we want to believe that if this wasn't happening, then this thing wouldn't be happening. We don't know what to do with it. We don't get it. We don't know how to live in it and through it. And so we don't even try to pull all these parts into the whole. I was reading Anne Lamott's book this week called Some Assembly Required, and she writes a letter to her grandson in it. I just want to read a part of it. She calls it a letter on the secret of life. She says this, you're going to go through life thinking there was a day in the second grade that you must have missed when the grown-ups came in and explained everything important to the other kids. They said, look, you're a human. You're going to feel isolated and afraid a lot of the time. You're going to have bad self-esteem, and you're going to feel uniquely ruined. And then they told the children who were there the magic phrase that everyone else uses when they're feeling blue. But only you don't know it, because you were at home sick the day that they told the kids the way the whole world works. But there is not such a day in school, no one got the instructions, and that's the secret of life. And it struck me that I think we all feel this way sometimes, especially in hard situations. Am I the only one who is having such a hard time here? I think I might actually be uniquely ruined. I really think I might be. So I'm going to take the situation that I don't know what to do with and I'm going to put it over here. Because I'm pretty sure I'm the only person on this earth who can't figure out how to integrate this all together. We might have ten different masters and we have strategies to cope with each one of them. And places we maybe put each one of them thinking if we can get them far enough away from us, we'll be rid of them and then we will feel free of them. What do you think it would feel like for you to live a life that was less divided and more congruent? Paul wants every single person to bring the whole of them to consider what the whole of their life means in this new life in Christ. Slaves included. Us included. The slaves could have said no, we could say no. We will not do that. What do you think will happen if we say no to this? Think about a person who lives their entire life completely resenting their situation and spends all their energy wishing their circumstances were different. Do you know anyone like that? Who has the power there? The circumstances. Who has no power? The person. Think about a person that you desperately want to impress, and you get to this point where you will say or do anything to impress this person. Who has the power there? The person you're trying to impress, and who has none? You. It's so tiring to fake it. It's so exhausting to grin and bear it, to have to be one thing in one space and another thing in another. Think about if that Trader Joe's gen was how I live my whole life, or I'm trying to kind of put on one show for one group of people, and then I'm losing it at all these other moments. Think of how tired I really would be. Some of you know exactly what I'm talking about, and you're tired from it right now. Some of you are really exhausted, and you don't even know it. And if you stop for a second, you really would, you know, recognize, I am so tired from how I have been managing and strategizing with all these different things in my life. Paul isn't giving a rule to the slaves to make life easier for the masters or to make the society more peaceful. He's trying to get at something deeper than that. We put so much energy into trying to change and manage our circumstances, and we don't even have control over them anyway. And so in doing that, we give these situations or these people a control and a power in our lives that they don't deserve. We become slaves by harboring a bitterness and resentment in us. And we heap the suffering on ourselves by living this kind of divided life. I really think Paul wanted the slaves to be physically free. I think that's what he wanted for them. But I think he also knew that just because you're released from slavery doesn't mean that you're free in here. There's a greater kind of freedom that you need to really be free. And it's inside. Now hear me say this loud and clear. If you are in a dysfunctional or an abusive relationship, I am not saying you need to stay in that and figure that out. And so there are situations that are so harmful to our body, to our mind, to our soul, that we need to get out immediately. And so if that is you or you're wondering if that's you, get help and get out. And if you don't know where to start with that help, call the church, talk to a pastor, and we will point you in the right direction. But I think for a lot of us, The masters in our life really are circumstances we're trying to control that we can't. Relationships, situations. What if your job didn't change? Do you think you could stay in it and not be enslaved to it? What if you didn't get a new family? Do you think you could stay in it and not be enslaved to it? What if you got sick or your spouse got sick? Could you live into that reality and not be enslaved to it? The sincere heart that Paul is speaking of here is not about a person who loves their circumstances or who likes their master. It's about a person who is living from a rooted and connected place in here that actually understands their relationship with others and their life. And they understand it in a way that allows them to be consistent and congruent in all the different aspects of their life. And doesn't that sound like freedom? That is freedom. That is true freedom. And this is something Paul was cultivating in his own life. He knew what it was like to live in circumstances outside of his control. Think about Paul's life. I want to read a part of 1 Corinthians 7 to you, starting in verse 17, where Paul says this. Nevertheless, each of you should live as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to you, just as God called you. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised, which I still do not know how that would work. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He shouldn't become circumcised. Circumcision is nothing. Uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts. So each of you should remain in the situation you were in when God called you. Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you. Although if you can gain your freedom, do so. For those who were slaves when called to faith in the Lord are the Lord's freed people. similarly those who were free when called are christ slaves you were bought at a price do not become a slave of human beings do not become a slave to human beings you have a choice in whether you're free or not you don't have to be a slave to your circumstances the cost of having something outside of you control your life may sound significant but the cost of living internally as a slave is much greater, is much scarier. And Paul knew that, and he knew that for this group of people. He wanted to invite them to something else. Because if you're enslaved inside, things are cultivated that you might not even be aware of. Think about the last five times that you lost your temper, and you kind of freaked out on someone. And that might have been, you know, yesterday, it might have been the last year, whatever it was. How were you really feeling at that moment. I think if we were all honest, we would say we were feeling part ashamed, we were feeling kind of out of control, like we weren't good enough, maybe we felt enslaved to something or someone, and we had this little notion that if we could just gain a little power over this other person, that somehow some of our pain would be transferred onto them, and then we wouldn't feel so heavy, and we wouldn't feel so alone. If you are enslaved in your soul, you will enslave other people. That is what will happen. And you have a choice, whether your situation changes or not, to not be a slave. If you let your circumstances enslave you, you're gonna lose out, and so will the people around you. My spiritual director says very profound things all the time. She's a 65-year-old nun. And whenever I get worked up in this place where I'm like, this has to change, and this person has to change, and I have to change. She listens well, and then she always says the same thing. Jen, would you consider that this could just be your life for now? Not forever, for now. Could you just do this today? Do you believe that your circumstances are just for now? That you are being asked to walk them out today and not forever? That doesn't mean we don't work to change our circumstances. We have to constantly be, I think, striving to create a better environment and better relationships for us to live and grow and be in. We have to make a healthier environment for us to learn and love and grow in. But the motivation for the change is a sincere heart, and it's not bitterness and resentment. We can't try to change our circumstances just to escape something that will control us, because there's always going to be another thing to control our lives. There'll always be something that's not letting us do exactly what we want, exactly when we want. So we have to commit to a life of freedom in here and say to God, yeah, I will do the hard, hard work of looking at what's going on in me and trying to make a change. And I will walk towards this freedom even if my circumstances don't change and even if not everyone around me acknowledges the freedom. I'm going to do it anyway. I'm going to identify my master. I'm going to get honest about my relationship with that master, and I'm gonna refuse to be enslaved to that thing, that circumstance, that person. How do you do that? That sounds really difficult. That sounds really ethereal. Paul tells the slaves how to do it right in the text. So let's take a look. Paul says, whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. So you do it, Paul is saying, by having Jesus as your master. Okay, how do you do that? I mean, what does that mean for Jesus to be your master? We're in a church, so maybe if I asked you, who's your master, you'd say Jesus. And you maybe would be telling the truth, but you'd probably be lying. If you asked me that and I said, yeah, Jesus controls every moment of every day, no way. So what would that even look like? What would that feel like? How would you do that? What keeps us from doing that? Think about the masters you're kind of identifying in your life. Maybe you're caring for a sick parent, and you have to take them to the doctor four times a week, and you never miss, ever. So that's your master. But maybe you really need a day off, and you're unwilling to ask someone to help you because you want to be the perfect son or the perfect daughter. So, you want to be the person who never asks for help, and that's your master. What do you think Jesus would say to you about that? Maybe you're in a relationship with someone where you will do or say anything for their approval. What do you think Jesus would say to you about that? Maybe you refuse to look in the mirror because you hate your body. So the perfect body is your master. What do you think Jesus would say to you about that? I was in the car the other day, and this song I like came on the radio. and my daughter, who asks probably 750 questions a day, saw a man holding a sign on the side of the road and she had every question you could think of about what he was doing. And I was kind of annoyed because I wanted to hear this song. What do you think Jesus would say to me about that? I have a couple ideas. There's this, these are really different situations but there's a common denominator. Me and you, my expectations and ideas of how things should go and yours. how often do we elect ourselves as the master in a situation? We maybe have these kind of surface masters or these situational things, but deep down it's really that I want to control this and rule this. I want to be the master here that I serve. How often do you think that is what keeps you from considering what Jesus would say if Jesus was your master in that situation? Because if Jesus is the master, actually, we don't get to be the master. That is a scary thought. how would you feel about that actually how would you feel about having jesus as your master what what is your experience um with jesus providing things for you what would you trust jesus for what would you not trust jesus for you think jesus would make you do crazy things maybe if we really want to cultivate a relationship with a different master we have to get honest about how we actually experience jesus and how we're actually interacting in that relationship. Slaves, Paul is saying, you have an opportunity to cultivate a relationship with a different master. And it might mean doing some scary things, and it might mean doing the unexpected thing, but at the end of the day, I promise you, it will feel like freedom. A kind of freedom that you never even dreamt could be possible in your life. Certainly it's going to feel more like freedom than your current situation, which is just a constant striving to change your circumstances and living totally bitter and resentful towards what's happening with your earthly master. I think Paul envisioned what was possible for a group of people who committed to living this way. And I think it's possible for us. My friend Tom, he is doing the seemingly impossible thing in the midst of really hard circumstances. He's choosing to not be enslaved in a really difficult situation. And he's looking for ways to be present, to laugh, to learn, to love. I emailed him this week with asking for permission to share his story, and he emailed back and graciously said, yes, you can share anything that you'd like. And then I emailed him back to thank him and said, P.S., how the heck are you doing this? Just any tips for all of us. And I want to read part of his email back. Here's what Tom said. It is ultimately about choosing back what you didn't have a choice in in the first place. It's about trusting that God can bring new life and resurrection into something you have no control over. That at a minimum, the experience will bring forth new qualities in you as a person for having gone through it. That God will transform you and meet your heart's deepest desire in the process, independent of the external circumstances. Trusting God to help you totally embrace and live into the experience and transcend it at the same time. You know part of Tom's story. This is crazy talk. I mean, it is really incredible that he is thinking about his life in this way. Tom is cultivating a relationship with a different master than his circumstance. And I know him well enough to know that he has some practices in place that are tethering him to that truth and to this reality. I know he spends a significant amount of time every day in quiet. I know he goes on walks every day. I know that he commits to eating food that nourishes his body. He says no to things that he doesn't want to do or doesn't have time to do. And he says yes to things that are life-giving to him. He looks for ways to tell his story and invite others in, in a really vulnerable way. He makes jokes. He takes care of his four-year-old grandson every week. I mean, he is intentionally cultivating this kind of freedom, even though his circumstances aren't going to change. And who's benefiting from that? He certainly is. His wife is, his kids are, his grandkids. The person who gets his groceries at Cub Foods is benefiting from that. Every single person that comes into contact with Tom is a benefactor of the freedom that he's cultivating for himself in his life, that God is partnering with him to create inside himself. For you, what types of things would you have to do to really cultivate a relationship with Jesus as your master? What would that look like for you? Would it be possible that you could live in your circumstance and really be serving someone else, be serving Christ? Maybe for you it's some of the things that Tom does. Maybe it's different. But would you consider dedicating some time towards figuring out what those practices are? What would connect you to the truth? about you, about God, about your relationship to your circumstances? Would you be willing to really pursue that freedom with whatever it took? Because if you do, you know who's going to benefit? You are. Your family and your friends are. Everyone you come into contact with will be a benefactor of the freedom that you're cultivating inside of yourself. And so believe that this invitation is for you. It is for us. That you can live in your current circumstances in a different way. That you can find freedom by refusing to be enslaved to the masters in your life. Amen? I would love to have you stand and I want to read just a simple benediction over you. It is one verse. It is Galatians 5.1. So I want you to hear this as you leave today. Church of the open door. Christ has set us free to live a free life. So take your stand. and never again let anyone put the burden of slavery on you. Amen? you
