We are this morning entering into the final week in a series that has come to be known around here as the pain of pornea. The issue at hand is that of homosexuality. We are in our second week on that particular issue. The presenting question relative to that is this. Is homosexuality a viable Christian option? Is there any context within which homosexuality can know the blessing of or receive the endorsement of God? Is gay okay? Now, last week in answering that question, we noted, first of all, the rapid and radical shift both in our culture and in the church at large relative to that question. And what we recognized, there was indeed a shift, a shift in the culture, evidenced on, I think, a daily basis through an incessant media blitz pressing hard for acceptance of homosexuality as normative, as amoral, comparing it to things such as race, gender, and being left-handed. Some people are left-handed, some people are right-handed, Some people are homosexual, some people are heterosexual. More and more, people who stand publicly against homosexuality are presented in the light of far-right, narrow-minded bigotry. We also noted last week, however, that not only has there been a shift in our culture, but there has been a shift in the church as well, empowered by and embodied in what has come to be known as the gay theology. In the July issue of Sojourners magazine, a self-professed cutting-edge Christian periodical, the testimony of one young man was this, and I quote, It is the resistance to and rejection of homosexuality that is the real abomination in the eyes of God. We have learned that our lesbian and gay sexual identities are gifts of God to be cherished and honored. And sin is whatever we and others do to hide or denigrate this gift. It has been a long and at times difficult faith journey to come to embrace and celebrate my homosexuality. Yet, quite simply, I had no choice. God kept nudging me. End quote. so it's a God thing and in this testimony I hear words familiar to me as it relates to testimony like sin was in there and gift, gifts of God and faith journey that sounds good but something has been twisted certainly coming from a Christian evangelical perspective of that testimony indicates to me some kind of shift in thinking. And all of these shifts, both cultural and in the context of the church, raise questions for me personally, like, is there a standard of truth that does not shift like sand with the latest opinion poll? Are their moral absolutes not obviated by what some so-called expert in the field or talk show host believes or speculates. And maybe even more disturbing to me as it relates to the shift in the culture and the church is this. Where is this shift going to end? Where are we as a culture and as a church headed? Well, the answer to that is who knows? But consider this. Dr. John Money, retired professor of medical psychology and pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University and Hospital says, and I quote, Pedophilia, which is sex between children and adults, which is still rejected in our culture, pedophilia should be viewed as sexual orientation, not as a disease or disorder, I'm hearing an echo here I wonder if this is where we're going if I were, he goes on to say to see a case of a boy aged 10 erotically attracted to a man in his 30s if the relationship is truly mutual and caring then I would not call it pathological in any way so pedophilia isn't necessarily bad if it's done nicely Dr. Wardell Pomeroy, a founding board member of an organization called the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States an organization known more familiar, known more broadly as PSYCHIS which, by the way, is an organization used today by many schools as a foundation for their sex education curriculum said in a September 7th Time Magazine article, and I quote, adult child sex can be wonderful and beautiful. The only downside is the attitude and consequences society places against such behavior, end quote. Dr. Derek Calderwood in 1983 in a psychist report said, and I quote, where no one gives the child a bad consequence, Intercourse between adults and children causes no mental or emotional harm. When negative effects have been observed, they are not the result of intercourse itself, but of adult suggestions that something is wrong with it. End quote. Okay. Let me get this straight. I need to work on this a little bit, and you've got to help me. What I'm hearing is this. Sin is not sin. Calling sin, sin is sin. Right? Okay, keep working on this now. I just want to get it straight in my mind. Wrong or what is wrong is not wrong. Calling what is wrong, wrong is wrong. Let's get therapeutic. Let's use the language of the 90s, especially got to be careful in the church because we can't even use words like sin anymore, archaic as that is. Behavior that is hurtful. That's a nice safe word, not sinful. Hurtful is not hurtful. Saying behavior that is hurtful is hurtful is hurtful. Okay, I got to get back to this question. Where is this stuff headed? Here is where I believe it is headed. Straight to hell. We are living in a culture that is spiraling downward at a frighteningly rapid rate. And we as the church dare not be to that naive. Whatever else is our response to what we see in our culture, The church of Jesus Christ cannot afford to be naive and surprised. Oh, my. 2 Timothy 3.13 says this. Timothy, evil men and imposters will proceed from bad to worse. I've got good news for you, Timothy. Things are going to get worse. Deceiving and being deceived. So what do we do if we're living in a culture or even in a church context like that? Where even in church, people are being deceived and are deceiving. Well, it's interesting what Paul said to Timothy about what to do. He said this, Timothy, you, however, continue in the things that you have learned, become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood, Timothy, you have known the sacred writings which have stood the test of time, which are able to give you wisdom that leads to salvation, not only salvation eternally, but salvation for every aspect of your life, being set free in every aspect of life through faith which is in Christ. Then it goes on to say, Scripture is inspired by God, profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correcting, for pulling people back in, for training people in righteousness, that the people of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. And in the spirit of that, we have begun to move in this arena of homosexuality by trying to do three things. One is this very thing. Fight to find some truth. What have the sacred writings said to us in the past? But we want to do more than that in this dealing. We want also to be careful to find and have a graceful response in all of this. And the third thing we're trying to do is look for ways to bring healing, especially to those who struggle with this issue. First thing we did, began last week, was to fight for the truth. And we did begin that last week by raising and affirming the design of God for our sexuality. established by God in Genesis 1 and 2, affirmed by Jesus in Matthew 19 and Mark chapter 10, also affirmed by Paul in Ephesians 5 and 1 Corinthians 6, the design of God clearly from the Word of God is this. Male and female created by God for each other, and for this cause of male and female created for each other, they shall leave and cleave, and the two shall become one flesh. And from the beginning, it has been thus, says Jesus in Matthew 19. Anything other than one man, one woman, no options, leave, cleave, to become one flesh, misses the mark. Adultery misses the mark of one man, one woman, no options. Fornication misses the mark. So does pedophilia, bestiality, sex even in a marriage context that is void of genuine intimacy, a connection of the spirit and soul also misses the mark. And along with all the other things in the sexual arena that misses the mark of God's design is included homosexuality. But the fact is this. In our sexuality, we better know up front, All of us in this room have badly missed the mark. All of us. Now, last week we examined some Old Testament texts that affirmed how homosexuality specifically misses the mark. Again, along with all sorts of other ways that we miss the mark. Genesis 19, Leviticus 18 were two places that affirmed homosexuality was among the things that missed the mark. Today we're going to deal with some New Testament texts that affirm the same thing. 1 Corinthians chapter 9 is one. 1 Timothy 1.10 is another one that's almost completely the same as 1 Corinthians 6.9. And just because of time and even the redundance of it, I don't have time to deal with 1 Timothy 1.10. So 1 Corinthians 6.9 and also Romans 1.26-28. Turn in your Bibles, if you would, to 1 Corinthians 6.9. It says this, Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Don't let anybody tell you different. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals. That's why this passage is significant for us, because it's mentioned here. but nor thieves, homosexuals are not the only focus, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the spirit of our God. The point of this text is twofold. The first point of the text is this. You need to hear loud and clear, especially those of you who are identified by this identity, fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, homosexuals, thieves, on and on and on. Number one, change for you is necessary. How do we know that? From the text, you shall not inherit the kingdom of God. There's another point of this text. It's in the 11th verse, and it's the wonderful good news verse. It's this. Not only is change necessary, but change is what? Possible. It says in verse 11, But such were some of you, but you are not anymore. If you are redeemed, you are no longer a fornicator. That does not mean that you don't struggle with that issue. Many of you still do. In fact, the reason Paul is writing this letter to the Corinthians is because these behaviors were creeping in even to the Christian experience in that church. And some of them were struggling still with these behaviors, but he is telling them this, having now been redeemed, that is no longer who you are. And he is calling this church as Jesus by the Spirit through his word today is calling the church to live in a way that is consistent with their brand new identity. You have been washed. You have been sanctified. you have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God, that's who you are, and I am calling you to get out here what I have created in here. It's called the process of sanctification, and for most people that process is not a magic wand. It is a process of life, of learning to, again, get out here what's in here. Two points of the text. Change is necessary, change is possible. The argument around this text from the gay theology is this, however. Homosexuals don't need change. And the argument for that is this. This passage is not dealing with homosexuals in any way, especially as it relates to homosexuality that is, here's the key, mutual, caring, loving, and monogamous. When Paul confronts in this passage anything that has to do with something that might be homosexual, that is, same-sex sex, he is not speaking of mutual love and caring commitment, but only of male prostitution in the temple or the sodomizing of young boys. Now, this argument revolves around two key words, obviously. The two in the text that are significant are, one, arsenikoitas, which is rendered in most of your texts homosexual. And the other is a Greek word, malakoi, which is rendered in most of your texts effeminate. Let's look at the words, arsenokoitas. It's a compound word coming from arsen, which is male. Koitas rings a bell, means sex, or more specifically intercourse. So this is a word that speaks of male intercourse. John Boswell, one of the prolific gay theologians from Yale University argues that this word arsenikoita simply refers to males involved in sexual behavior generally, not homosexual at all. The callousness of the word, he argues from the syntax, the thrusting aggressiveness of it indicates active licentiousness, not homosexuality. His argument would be the word homosexual is a very poor translation, that it is speaking generally of all men, probably heterosexual, who are out of control sexually. That's the argument from Boswell. Robin Scroggs, another renowned theologian among those who would espouse to the gay theology, admits that this word is dealing clearly with same-sex sex, but it is referring only to temple prostitution, male prostitution, that happened in the temple. Now, I need to give you a little background here in terms of what's going on in the thinking of the gay theology and where they draw some of their conclusions. One of the interesting and to some compelling assertions of the gay theology is that Paul did not understand or know anything about what we call today sexual orientation. He did not understand and had no context in his culture within which to understand a monogamous relationship between a man and a man or a woman and a woman. The argument being it didn't exist. Therefore, if monogamous, loving, caring relationships didn't exist, nowhere could Paul have ever been confronting that in the text when same-sex behavior was being dealt with because in his mind he didn't know about it. Are you following that? I know it's a little complicated. He obviously wasn't confronting that because in his culture he didn't know about it. It didn't exist. There's only one problem with that. It's this, the truth. Pre-Christian Greece, according to the writings of Plato and Socrates, spoke of sexual love between males that was thought by many to be superior to the love of men and women. It was a well-known fact in Rome that a number of the high-ranking people in the government, emperors, for instance, were homosexual and had homosexual long-standing relationships, homosexually, with individuals. And that ironically, even in Rome, where at high levels homosexuality was real and relationships were sometimes even monogamous, the law of the land was no homosexuality. It was illegal because even the leaders knew that if what we're doing at the top was fleshed out into our culture, we would literally collapse. The Greeks were known to put homosexual couples who were committed to one another in the same military troop believing that in battle they will fight more fiercely because they are with their lover or with their husband or whatever, their mate. February 10th article of the Star Tribune newspaper a woman by the name of Jennifer Reikinga a scholar at Claremont Graduate School of Religion trying to establish homosexuality as normative historically cites archaeological evidence of same-sex marriage ceremonies at the time of Christ to argue that Paul didn't understand that there could be monogamous, caring, loving homosexual relationships is false. In their culture, it was known. The fact is this. The reason Paul makes no distinction in the text anywhere between good homosexuality and bad homosexuality, appropriate homosexuality and inappropriate homosexuality is because in the mind of Paul, there was no distinction. Second Greek word of significance in the text is malakoi. It is translated literally soft, delicate, or effeminate. Now, some in the gay theology argue, and I believe acrobatically argue, that this is not speaking of same-sex sex at all. That this word simply means in its basis form loose, morally weak, and lacking self-control. Again, not speaking of homosexual behavior, indeed of heterosexual behavior. Milton, one of their scholars, goes so far as to argue that this is speaking of a man who is so obsessed with sex, and so obsessed with the opposite sex, that he becomes effeminate being obsessed with the feminine. others in their ranks understanding the Greek that it really is malakoi is dealing with same sex sex take a different track and embrace the idea that what this is dealing with again is not any kind of loving caring relationship but only exclusively the homosexual abuse of young boys the concept of pederasty now there's a problem with that argument as well and it's kind of technical but the problem is this if what paul is speaking here when he uses the word or effeminate is only speaking to the soft young boys being used abusively by bigger stronger males for sexual intercourse that if he was speaking of that there is a very common greek word for that concepts. Piderasteo is the word, and clearly, if that's what he meant, that's what he would have said. I believe that what we clearly have in these two words is reference to both partners in a homosexual act. The fact that they are next to each other is even compelling. Arsenekoitas, arsene male koitas intercourse, is the act of male koitas, or intercourse, the act of male entering, if you will, with one who is malakoi. The male entering arsenikoitos, the malakoi who is effeminate. Now, key word here, understanding. The effeminate word here does not mean effeminate in mannerism. We have a lot of stereotypes of especially young men who act in a feminine way, automatically they're homosexual. That is not at all what's being spoken of here. The effeminate here is not in mannerism, but in role. Actually, this is much more graphic. As the arsenikoitas, male intercourse, enters, the malakoi, the malakoi receives this entrance softly, delicately, effeminately as a woman would receive a man. I want to be as delicate as I possibly can, but I want to put something up on a screen, and it's just this. We were not made for that. We were not built for that. Second passage, Romans chapter 1. Significant text. One you're fairly familiar with, I believe. I'm going to deal with the broader context, but the key verses are 26 and 27. For this reason, God gave them over to degrading passions, for their women exchanged a natural function for that which is unnatural. And in the same way also, the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons a due penalty of their error. There's two arguments related to this issue coming out of the gay theology. Number one is this. Paul is only speaking here, again, of promiscuous, idolatrous, out-of-control homosexuality, not loving, caring, mutual homosexuality. They get this out of the middle of the 27th verse when it says they burned in their desire toward one another. That's the real sin, burning in desire. This out-of-control lust is the real sin. And we would even say that is wrong. This is clearly not Paul confronting loving, caring, monogamous homosexuality. It's the lustful thing he's confronting. So that's one track they run on. The other is this. We need to understand this issue of natural and unnatural. It says they exchange what is natural for unnatural. What we need to understand is this. For one who is by orientation, for one who is by genetic makeup or physical constitution a homosexual, what you need to understand is for that person, homosexuality in terms of activity is not unnatural. For that person, homosexual activity is natural. Why? Because that's the way they're made. This, according to them, is not a confrontation, again, on homosexuality in general, but only a confrontation on those who are acting out homosexually when to them that is not a natural thing. This is a confrontation on heterosexuals, the argument goes. Who, because of idolatrous, sexual, out-of-control lifestyles, have experienced, in other words, everything there is to experience in a heterosexual arena, decide to take it one step further, walk, as it were, on the wild side, and enter into a sexual relationship with a man or a woman with a woman. That's what he's confronting. Frogs, by the way, another one of their renowned, very intelligent scholars, go so far as to say, if you are a homosexual by nature, by orientation and genetics, the truth is, for you to act out heterosexually would be unnatural. And in that context, then this verse would apply to you. So for you, homosexual, genetically based, a walk on the wild side for you, inconsistent with who you are, then it being called sin would be to be heterosexual. Now, this argument appeals exclusively to something we're hearing a lot about lately, that is orientation. Genetics. Studies being done right now are, I believe, frantically looking for genetic links, thinking that by that link we will declare none of this having any moral connection. You see, if it's genetic, if it's orientation, if it's just the way I am, then you can't make a moral judgment about my behavior. I was created this way. Let's bring God into it. God, in fact, created me this way. Therefore, since this is just the way I am, it's not my fault. It's just like being black. No, it's not. No, it's not. What we need to be careful to do here and to try to help sort out what's really going on here in this argument is this, just appeal to this. We need to compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges, and you can't start mixing them up. And I think something has been horribly mixed up in this argument. Let me try to illustrate it by bringing in other issues and applying the same logic. On January 18th, just this last January, St. Paul Pioneer Press, in Section D, what's called the Express Section, had as a headline these two words, and I quote, cheating genes. That attracted my attention. Right underneath I read this quote, and I do quote, 50% of all married people are adulterers, studies say. I love that. Studies say lots of things. An anthropologist, Helen E. Fisher says, it's not their fault we're built to wander, end quote. It's just our orientation, men and women. It is part of our genetic makeup. The fact is this. God made us that way. God gets blamed for lots of things. It's just the way I am. I was built to wander. Therefore, it's not my fault. The cruelest thing, by the way, in a session of therapy you could possibly do to one who is genetically made up to heterosexually wander would be to put a restriction on me telling me that there is a moral value on that and that it's not the healthy thing to do. That there is a thing called virtue, there is a thing called right and wrong by which we need to set up the standards of our life. Terribly cruel thing to say to someone who's genetically built to wander, not to wander. And the fact that there are 50% who do commit adultery is powerful proof that that's the way it ought to be. beloved it is spiraling downward at a frighteningly rapid rate but among the people of God we have never gotten our cues from public opinion polls don't start now star tribune two weeks ago heralded the study of a genetic connection to crime. Meaning people who are filling our prisons, they're finding out there's a genetic thing, so let's put that on this one. It's just the way they are. It's their orientation. So if they murder someone or rob someone, you know what? Actually, it's not their fault how cruel it would be to have someone who is genetically built to rob and plunder to tell them that they shouldn't. We can't put that moral value judgment on them. long has been seen a connection among some who struggle with alcoholism that for some there is a genetic predisposition but in that arena we make a separation we understand that even if there is a genetic predisposition for a criminal or an alcoholic that that does not by virtue of the fact that there is a predisposition somewhere in you for whatever reason, that it is now okay to do the behavior. We teach people with those unfortunate and painful imbalances that there need to be ways to control the behavior or change the behavior. Is it a moral issue or not? Some will have to decide. We have to decide. If you take it out of that milieu and compare it to race, you've got apples not compared to apples. Faulty in logic. By the way, I will make one concession to this what is natural argument, and that is this. In a fallen world, which is what we're dealing with in Romans chapter 1, In a world where men and women have exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and God has given them over to what it is that they want, depravity in that kind of world is what? Natural. Sin is natural. It doesn't make it right. See, the fact is this, even for me as a heterosexual, I struggle as you struggle with heterosexual issues. Sin in many arenas, if I would yield to it, feels like the most natural thing in the world, feels like the best thing in the world. There is an enormous price tag on it. But the fact is, in a fallen world, what is unnatural begins to look natural. Let's get the flow of the text. Over in verse 20. For since the creation of the world, his, that's God's, invisible attributes, his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that we are without excuse. Hear this. When we go later into verse 26 and 27, and he is speaking of what is unnatural, he, Paul, is not comparing unnatural to someone's sexual orientation here in the text. He is comparing what is natural and unnatural in the text to what has been created since the creation of the world. This has been the design of God. And what is natural or unnatural is being compared to that. Verse 21, we see here the sin Paul is dealing with and confronting. It's this. For even though they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks, but became futile in their speculations and their foolish heart was darkened. The sin, beloved, hear this exegetically, that Paul is dealing with is not primarily homosexuality. It is not the point of this text. The sin is this. They did not honor God, and they did not give thanks. And professing to be wise, in that they became fools. We don't need God. We're God. The result of that sin, and again, keep in mind, that was the sin. The result of that sin was three exchanges in the text. Exchange number one. They exchanged, verse 23, the glory of the incorruptible God for an image. So they traded in the glory of God. They exchanged also verse 25, the truth of God for a lie. His design, His presence in my life, His right to rule, and my need to bow my knee to His glory and design and purpose in my life is no longer the power in my life. I am the one who decides and I will find a God who is in my image, who is to my liking. They exchanged, first of all, the glory of God. They exchanged the truth of God. And the third thing they exchanged was verse 26, natural function. But natural function comes down the road. And I believe that this natural function of men for women, now women for women, men for men, that exchange is not the ultimate sin Paul is dealing with here. I believe that exchange is simply now a physical manifestation of a spiritual exchange that had already taken place, exchanging the glory of God, exchanging the truth of God. It's kind of metaphysical, kind of spiritual. Now I've got something tangible to look at. And when I see women with women, I see a physical manifestation of something that happened prior to that, that twisted and turned the created design of God for all men and women. Only manifested there. Kind of confusing. Richard Hayes, formerly of Yale Divinity School, now at Duke Divinity School, says it well. And I quote, Paul singles out homosexuality not because it's the worst possible sin, or even because it's the overriding point of the text, because it's not. He does it because it is a particularly graphic image of the way in which human fallenness distorts God's created order. God the Creator made man and woman for each other, to cleave together, to be fruitful, and to multiply. When human beings exchange, I'm sorry, when human beings engage in homosexual activity, they enact an outward invisible sign of an inward spirituality. Or an inward spiritual reality, rather. And that reality is the rejection of the Creator's design. They serve as a physical picture of everyone. They are not alone, but they serve as a physical picture of everyone who has exchanged the truth of God for a lie. End quote. So here's my question. Who has exchanged the truth of God for a lie? Homosexuals. It's right in the text. Yes, it's true. But that is not Paul's point. In order to get Paul's point, we need to keep on moving. And let's do that. Verse 28. Just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do things which are not proper. Stop right there. What are the things not proper? Well, my mind's going back. Men with men, women with women. That? Absolutely that. But follow the text, things which are not proper. Here's his examples. Being filled with unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice. They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents. What a list. Without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful. And although they know, all of them know, the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things, what such things? Homosexuality? Yes. And slander, arrogance, boastfulness, inventing evil. Those who practice such things are worthy of death. They not only do the same, but give a hearty yes to other people who do. And all of us, beloved, and this is the power of the text, are by the pen of Paul being leveled. No longer using this text rightly can we on our high horses stand and say homosexuality is in there. But we are all in here. Chapter 2, verse 1 says, Therefore, you are all without excuse. And do you know where I am right now with those words? In a wonderful place where I've wanted to get for two solid weeks to the place where I can begin to talk about how it is we can now extend grace to this arena. How is that? Well, here's the answer to that. The way we extend grace to this arena of homosexuality is the same way grace is ever extended in any arena of your life or my life, be it homosexual or heterosexual. Grace comes to and is lavished upon the broken, the mourning. It has come to and it is lavished upon those men and women who quit denying their sin, quit rationalizing their sin, quit blaming everybody else for their sin, quit redefining their sin, quit hiding their sin, they quit doing that, those are the ones who get the comfort. They are the ones who get the grace. This grace that we desperately want to dispense to people comes to both people struggling with homosexuality and struggles in heterosexuality. It comes to people who are in all of those contexts hungering and thirsting for a righteousness that they have finally been made aware they cannot change by trying hard. You know why? Because genetically, by the fall, I have been built to wander. And I need something by the power of the Spirit to create a righteousness in me that I can't produce. And homosexual struggles with the same reality that something deep in me has been made to do this. And I am hungering for his righteousness now. I've asked this question before from this pulpit. Where does hungering and thirsting for his righteousness come from? The answer, again, you've heard several times over this pulpit. It comes from, among other places, the proper working of the law. And do you know what? for two weeks on this issue, I have pounded away giving you the law. For what purpose, Dave? This is graceful church. I'm preaching law. There's three purposes of the law, three reasons why I would preach it. You've heard this before as well. First purpose of the law is this, to reveal sin. And sometimes those who even need the name, who name the name of Jesus need to have the sin in their life, in my life, revealed. Because we are poisoned by the spiraling reality downward in our culture. It is not a kind word to come to, for instance, a heterosexual who is compulsive and out of control and say to him, because I care for him or her so much and empathize with their struggle, you don't need to worry. That adultery really is no big deal. It's really not a problem. Any more than it would be a loving gesture to come to one who is a homosexual, struggling with their homosexuality, telling them that there can be freedom. Don't worry. That's really okay. There's nothing wrong with it. That is not an act of love. The purpose of the law is to reveal sin. regardless of protests, regardless of acrobatic exegesis, the law of God is clear and it has not changed. Leviticus 18 verse 20 says, For a man to lie with a man as with a woman is an abomination. And that is a true thing. But so is greed and envy and arrogance. And if, by the way, you think I'm stretching it to attach a word like abomination to those behaviors. I mean, we would all agree they're wrong, but abomination? Proverbs 6, 16 says this. Six things the Lord hates. Yes, seven are an abomination to Him. What are they? Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, hearts that devise wicked plans, and feet that run swiftly to evil, et cetera, et cetera. Abomination to God. And we can hear that, beloved. The law come and expose to us in our lifestyles our sin, and we can walk away angry. I would expect, I hope not, but with this many people, three services, that some people are going to walk out the door angry. and some people having heard this word will hang on even more fiercely to their sin. But the purpose of the law is not complete in you if that is the result. The purpose of the law on the front end is to indeed say this is sin and we're not going to change the rules for you. But the second purpose of the law is this. When men and women hear the law of God and come up saying, oh, dear God, I have broken your law, transgressed. I have missed the mark. I have exchanged the truth of God for a lie. I cannot any longer deny it. I cannot undo it. I cannot change it. I cannot redefine it. But, beloved, for you to come to that point and stay there would be of all things most tragic to just recognize that you've missed the mark and also to recognize there's nothing you can do about it. The third purpose of the law, when it is complete, is to do this. It is to, in our brokenness, and recognizing that we cannot do anything about our sin, to drive us to our only hope, which is Christ, to drive us to our only hope, which is grace. Galatians 3.24 says this, Therefore the law has become our tutor, whose purpose it is to lead us to, literally, to drive us to Christ, that we may be then justified by faith, not by our striving, justified by our faith. And when we come to Christ, having seen our sin, having quit our denials and redefinitions of our sin, and accepted as the moral standard His, recognizing we could never possibly, in our effort, attain that precious law that we now love, we come to God and say, we need some grace, and He gives then grace. He receives us. He forgives us. He cleanses us. He renames us. No longer are you slaves. You are sons. And you know what else? The grace that forgives us does more than forgive us. The grace that forgives us has power to change us from the inside out. And that applies, beloved, to heterosexuals who felt at the beginning of this series several months ago that in the area of their sexuality, there was no hope for them. If there is no hope for you, then this grace that we preach is one without power. but I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ because I believe it is the power of God to salvation not just to get you to heaven but it is the power of God to save you in your life and that same word needs to come to homosexuals who for whatever reason are struggling with that the gospel that we preach when you quit denying what is right and wrong recognize you missed the mark just like we all missed the mark and come to God broken, mourning, hungering for his righteousness. He receives, he forgives, he gives you a brand new name. For some of you, your struggle is not over. Some people do experience instantaneous things. We hear reports of that, heterosexually and homosexually. But most of what we hear and see and experience is a process of the life of God in people, bringing about a process of freedom. Jeremiah 6.14 condemns those who, quote, heal the wounds of my people lightly, saying, peace, peace, when there is no peace. The image of the text here is that of one so driven to make people feel better that they proclaim a peace being at hand when, in truth, death is at the door. I will say it again. I am no friend of yours. If I were to help you deal with your sin by telling you, peace, peace, there is no danger there. There is no death there. In fact, embrace it. There's life in your heterosexual out of control. There's life in your homosexual. You can find life. Yeah, I would be no friend of yours. Might make you feel good on the front end. I believe the lie of the gay theology among many lies is this, that it provides, number one, cheap grace. what is cheap grace? Cheap grace is grace offered without any need to acknowledge sin. If you get grace without acknowledging sin you have not gotten grace. You might have gotten a good feeling but you didn't get grace. Cheap grace is grace that is offered and no need for brokenness. No need for mourning. No need for repentance. We'll find a way for you to claim the acceptance and favor of God and just love your sin at the same time. That is maligning the truth. The other lie of the gay theology among many is this. Not only does it provide cheap grace, but it provides impotent grace that doesn't have the power to change. And the fact is this. Those among us who struggle with homosexuality desperately need to know the same thing heterosexuals struggle with in their heterosexuality, and that is this. This grace we preach, not only as one of forgiveness and acceptance and giving you a new name, but it does have the power to change. You and me. And if it doesn't, then none of us have any hope because all of us are moral failures. Let me close this whole thing with a quote that is a bit of a spin on some of the other things I've said. I haven't dealt directly with this, but I close with a quote from Stanton L. Jones, associate professor of psychology at Wheaton College. Quote, Compassion should lead us to care for the dying among us. A time is coming when the majority of those who suffer from AIDS may no longer be homosexual, but that is not currently the case. We should collectively be active in ministry to this afflicted population. Some say compassion begins here, in believing that no one deserves to die, especially those who die so horribly of AIDS. I believe exactly opposite. Hear this. That compassion begins with the realization that we all deserve to die and are thus no different from persons with AIDS and that God calls us, His church, to a ministry of compassion and love to everyone and anyone, even if they don't repent. Hear that. Compassion and love, even if they don't repent. That is the posture of the church. Grace to the broken. Grace to those who mourn over their sin, who quit denying their sin. Healing to the broken, to the mourning. But our posture to the community that is ever spiraling downward is one of love and compassion, even if they don't repent, even if they never come broken. And that, beloved, puts the church in an almost impossible position, one that saved the supernatural power of God we could never maintain. The church of the 90s, beloved, simply because of the culture that we live in, that we cannot be naive to, is in a position that only, again, the supernatural power of God could help us maintain. The position is this. On one hand, to build bridges of compassion and love to a people group, because of this series, what we're speaking of specifically here, the people group being homosexuals, to a people group who desperately need to hear and somehow experience amazing grace. So on one hand, our function, express to them and extend to them compassion and love. And at the very same time, draw a line in the sand that will not be changed relative to what is right and what is wrong. How on earth will we walk that balance? The only answer I know to that question is this. It is going to have to be by the supernatural empowerment of the Holy Spirit of God upon his people in this age, for this time, for this culture in which we live. An empowered people, an anointed by the Spirit of God people who know who they are, who know where to draw the line, and at the same time we're drawing lines in the sand. And when we do, we may be assaulted, extending at the same time love and compassion, and being reviled he reviled not again. I don't know about you, but that puts me flat on my face. Holy Spirit of God, come and raise up your people. Last thought, it occurs to me that as a pastor of this church, I am not so interested in being a church of the 90s. Church of the 90s, that sounds like our need to be contemporary and hip. I am not as concerned with being a church of the 90s as much as I am very, very concerned with being His church, holy and come apart, His church in the 90s, in this culture, His people. Amen. Amen. I believe God is doing a work. I don't know the extent of it all I believe that for us and for our little narrow view it's starting among us but there are other men and women across this country that I believe God's calling not in this abrasive we will be misunderstood we will come off as abrasive I'm just sure from time to time but men and women of grace empowered by the spirit to in a spiraling culture be an alternative a voice of reason, a voice of grace, a life in the Spirit, a voice of hope and healing to people who we may be repulsed by, but I believe are ready for a message of grace, not compromising the word of truth about sin. Thus ends our series on the pain of porneia. Begun in Acts chapter 15 with a word from the Apostle James to a group of believers in Antioch, Syria. Beloved, abstain from fornication. For if you keep yourself free from such things, you will do well. Bless you. I want you to stand. I want the altar ministry to come, and Dan is going to come and lead us in a song that he wrote in the middle of this series. This song came to him from the Spirit of God, I believe, and I just think it's a good way to end the series, and let it just be our prayer. Those who need prayer, you come. I'd like to pray. Jesus, I thank you for the things that you gave to us in the middle of this series, The things you made us aware of, certainly not only as it relates to homosexuality, but so many arenas of how we have been wounded and how we wound one another in this area of our sexuality. And I know, God, that you have brought healing to many, and you have brought truth, and many of us are on new kinds of pilgrimages because of your word of truth. I pray in Jesus' name that now as we move away from this, attention on this, that your spirit would continue to call your people out, to heal them with the life of your spirit and the truth of your word. May we be, it is our heart, your people in this culture. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
