You will see that this is a reliable plan for growing in every dimension of the spiritual life. The balance of these will be somewhat related to you individually. Not everyone needs to practice the same disciplines in the same way. And once you understand that these are not deeds of righteousness, that you'll then, I think, be easy with that idea. Don't try to judge your use of disciplines by someone else's. That will bring you into bondage. As you practice these, you want to walk with the Lord. I'm assuming that you can hear from God, that you know what his voice is, and you can ask him about things you need to know with confidence that if there's anything he wants you to know, he will tell you. that he's not going to trick you and mumble and keep you walking a tightrope that he is a good God at least as good as you are and you wouldn't do that to anybody you love and he won't do it either so you may need to learn a little bit about that but in any case if you just simply take these and begin to implement you learn as you go you don't first learn all about it and then do it You learn as you go. And you learn under the great teacher. He will teach you what you need to know. And I have put in these little warnings like don't be a hero. None of these, don't be a hero. If you find yourself being a hero, back out. Sometimes solitude may, you may have strange feelings in solitude and silence. Anytime you feel threatened, back out. Go talk to your pastors or your friends. Never hesitate to stop a discipline and look for help, understanding. Again, these are not works of righteousness. So it isn't a failure if you start to fast and you can't fast, or you don't fast. Don't treat it as a failure. Treat it as something that you need to learn how to do. and that's all there is to it. Now, we began to plan for hearty Christ-likeness by making these regular parts of our lives with Jesus. With Jesus. Always with him. And these are plans that enable us to put off the old person and put on the new. See? This is how we do it. So, you want to put off the old person. Remember the old person? That's the guy with the malice and the anger and the blasphemy and the lies and all that sort of stuff. Put him on. You can do that. These will help you do that. Now, I'm assuming that you're already alive in Christ. But when you move on with these, then you will find all of the old man dropping off, the new man coming on. The new person will be coming on. and it won't be hard if you use the means. It's very hard, impossible, if you don't use the means. But if you use the means, it is not hard. You do have to learn, and there will be some discomfort with it, but you'll get through that, and then you'll begin to see the results. Now, spiritual disciplines, you can talk about them forever and not be convinced, But when you put them into practice, they are self-validating. They're self-validating. You approach them experimentally, that is, in a learning attitude. Remember to hold your vision and your intention clear, and then these are the means. And they will work. They have worked for millennia of Christians, and they will work for us today. Nothing has substantially changed. Now, when you employ them in this way, then you will experience a shift. God's design over here. God first, spirit second, soul third, body last. The improper subordination you are shifting from is this one. Body first, soul second, spirit third, God last. This is the kingdom of the human being apart from God. And in that kingdom, the body always comes first. Always comes first. And that's because it's the center of the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. So you are shifting over. Now, ironically, it is by using your will, now alive in God, to redirect the body, and those are your spiritual disciplines, but redirect the body, you get this transformation. Now, I want to stop for a moment at this point and take some questions. There was one in particular that I wanted to respond to. And where is my... Bob. Where's Bob? Yes. Would you restate your question now as clearly as you can? Bob, let me try a few responses and see how I'm doing, and then you come back again, if you would, please. First of all, let's say good things about the recovery movement because it responded to real human need. And, of course, it has branched out into recovery from many different kinds of things, but fundamentally it was oriented around the AA program. And we simply cannot say too much that's good about it because of the great good that comes from it. It's a proven method. It was rooted in Christian faith when it started and has, of course, since then drifted away from that, but even so, there's still a lot of good in it. In fact, I've often noted that many of our more liberal churches especially could not have survived except for the rent that recovery groups were paying for their rooms. And it's really true. And it's quite ironic, you know, that this would, they would sort of be paying back a little bit here. Maybe some of those churches shouldn't have survived, but that's another story. So now, let's, that's a good thing. Now here's the limitation. The limitation is that recovery groups are focused not on the transformation of the person but upon the solution as a problem. You can be sober and still be a thoroughly miserable, wicked human being. And some of the other associated programs, they're all focused on solving a specific kind of problem. that means they have built into them a limitation. And in fact, very few of them have the same fearless approach to the moral life that the AA program had. And so gradually they move away both from a conception of God that was based upon Christian teaching and on the person of Christ and from the moral content of the AA program, which we put up here a few moments ago. And they moved more and more to the merely therapeutic, merely finding a way to solve the particular problem that is controlling the individual's life. And as a result, they have increasingly left the larger picture of human redemption aside, or totally dismissed it. Now that's the main problem. I think that there is now among Christian psychologists that I am aware of an increasing realization that they have to integrate what therapeutic techniques they have with a larger picture of redemption and spirituality. And that's partly, again, because they have not succeeded as well as they might have with their goals as therapists. So now I don't know if there's something else hanging there that I should address or if others would like to get in on that discussion, but it's a very important area. Spiritual disciplines lead to the inner transformation of the self into Christ-likeness. That simply is not what is dealt with. Way back here, lady back here. Uh-huh. Okay. I'm sorry, I couldn't hear. Yes, okay. That's okay, I thought. That's fine. Now, we need to go on from that. So if that lays a foundation for larger well-being, then how do we go on from that? Yes? My question is, it seems... I would think so. It's kind of a mixed bag. Well, yes. So the question is how do you draw the line between support groups and therapy groups? And I think it's very hard to do that. I think that what we should assume is that if you're going to get into therapy groups, you should have people who are specially trained to do it. Support groups do not require the same kind of knowledge as when you get into therapy groups. And I think very often a support group that wavers over into therapy without people who really have the knowledge to handle it may do more damage than good. And so I think if you can keep those functions distinct, you probably should. Well, right. So support groups often become commiseration groups. And if you lose the idea of change and progress, then you really need, I think, to get into a different group. Right. Because the function is to bring us forward, whether it's in spiritual formation generally or with reference to a support group. It's to move us forward. And we need to be clear about that and not just use it as a sort of exercise in commiseration. Yes. They just whip themselves over their inability to do them. And I'm just curious, just on a practical level, how would you minister to someone? Well, I'm constantly dealing with that because that's our culture, basically. Discipline is a bad word. it's like punishment so what I do is I start with outside of the circle and I talk to them about musicians and sports figures I talk to them about what discipline enables them to do I help them to see that discipline is life-giving and I recognize that many of the things that they've been presented with as disciplines has not been life-giving to them and we talk about why that is so I would say that the number one issue I have to deal with traveling around is guilt over so-called quiet time. And this is a badly misunderstood practice today. And my advice to people immediately is forget it. Forget it. Don't do this anymore. You have to think about this in a different way. And the teaching about quiet time, of course, had a place in another century, frankly. A different kind of world, but you have to think differently. And one of the things I try to do is to get people to thinking in a different calendar than day by day. What do you do through the week? What do you do through the month? What do you do through three months? What do you do through half a year and a year? So that instead of thinking in terms of being hammered for 15 minutes a day, that don't result in anything. See, that's actually my idea about one drop of water every five minutes for eternity won't get you a shower. That's actually what's going on in the quiet time thing. And so you just have to say, you have to be honest with people's experience. And you have to assume that fundamentally they mean well, or otherwise they wouldn't even feel guilty. then you have to give them something that will help in place of that and I think that you can do that but it always comes down to enabling them to begin to experience the goodness that comes from the practices so for example I might not start with saying anything about quiet time at all but perhaps work with memorization or I mean I haven't talked about celebration up here. There's very few people are in a position to use that. They don't understand it. But you need to present a full range of disciplines and help them see how they actually work. They have to get away from the idea that this is something I have to do because God wants me to do it whether or not it does me any good. And you really have to sympathize and get on the side of people and agree with them about that because that's right. That isn't the way it works. but see they have been ground, they've had legalism ground into them and we just have to lift that off are there any other questions at this point? I want to say some things about, okay we've got, yes well that's an important distinction for sure but I would want to point out that the reason that does is because legalism is merit-based. Spiritual disciplines are wisdom-based. That's why that difference comes out. We need to understand that difference. We don't practice spiritual disciplines to in any way accumulate merit. I mean, imagine the person who is jogging so that he can brag about it at the office. That's a rather silly picture, But see, that person is thinking about jogging as accumulating merit. And then the person who simply does their exercise for their physical well-being. That's a totally different outlook. And we have to emphasize that in following Christ. Christ isn't keeping his eye on us, checking out, you know, did we do quiet time? Did we do this? Did we do... Did you memorize those three verses? That's Sunday school stuff. and unfortunately that's where we learn a lot of legalism but we just have to move beyond that and begin to understand there's that which is good for us and that which is not and that's why we do spiritual disciplines because they're good for us yes for example you may have a person who has suffered some real abuse as a child maybe ritual maybe sexual, verbal, whatever they have been wounded in their souls until they experience silence and solitude as rejection you don't want to send that person into solitude or silence they can't benefit from it probably can't even do it so you want to be sensitive to what can be done in a profitable way and what can't. And there are many people who simply cannot practice some disciplines. Like there are people who have been tortured by silence until silence is just insufferable. They cannot stand silence. Other disciplines like for example fellowship, confession, submission, have their own problems built into them. So just basically you have to be sensitive to what people can do in such a way that it's good for them. And of course in some cases they can't do them at all. So like prayer as a discipline. Now prayer is more than a discipline. Like worship, it's more than a discipline. But prayer sometimes people cannot, they just cannot do it because they are so distracted. They don't understand why there is such a thing as prayer. It doesn't make sense to them. They don't believe it makes any difference to God, and they can't believe that God is just trying to get them to do it because he wants to see them dance on the end of the string. So there's where you have to do teaching. I mean, what is prayer about? There are many, many people that simply cannot pray. And so you don't try to force that. You try to, sometimes real prayer or deliverance ministries are needed for people. And you do have people who are, they get in a condition where they cannot stand the word of God. And so you have to deal with those differently. Right back of you, yes? Self-care and self-sacrifice. Well, the disciplines are a form of self-care. Let me start with that. I mean, that's what they are. Of course, they're done with the understanding that they're done not alone, but in action with God. So they are a form of self-care. Self-sacrifice is one of the disciplines. It is a matter of turning loose, not just what I had frugality up here. Frugality is where we turn loose of luxuries, but sacrifice is where we turn loose of what we really need. And it is a discipline in learning that God is there beyond all the resources I may have, that God is there. Self-sacrifice has to be handled carefully. It's especially dangerous if it's interpreted as a merit-producing thing. very dangerous at that point self-sacrifice should be presented as an act of surrendering my kingdom should be understood should be understood that he that saveth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it so self-sacrifice is always stepping into a larger framework in which I am cared for by God. So I can sacrifice myself because God cares for me. He sacrificed for me. You have to be very careful in presenting those, but I think that's basically the way you want to think about it. Disciplines are a form of caring for the soul. One final question for this round. What does the discipline of celebration look like? Discipline, the celebration looks like Deuteronomy 14. I'll give you a reference. Deuteronomy 14 is where they go down to the big city of Jerusalem to worship God. And then they tie their money up in a sack and take it down there, and they buy meat and drink. And if you can stand this whatsoever, their soul lusteth after. And they don't go by themselves. They take the preacher with them and the whole family, and they go down there for a paid vacation. and they learn to have confidence in the goodness of God. Celebration is like worship except it deals primarily with what good God has done for you individually. Celebration looks like the wedding at Cana. Celebration looks like David dancing before the ark, writing psalms that say, By my God, I have run through a troop. By my God, I have leaped over a wall. That's celebration. Celebration is Miriam out there going across the plains with a tambourine saying, The horse and the rider he has thrown in the sea. That's celebration. It's what God, what? You see, we need to know that God has done well by us. That's what celebration is. It's dwelling on the things that God has done for us. If upon life's billows you are tempest-tossed, do not be discouraged, saying, All is lost. Count your many blessings. Name them one by one, and it will surprise you what the Lord has done. That's celebration. And you might be surprised that the Scripture actually says you should take a tithe in Deuteronomy 14 for that purpose. But if you do that, we'll not have so many grim-faced saints. I don't see many in this group, but, you know, we really do believe in the goodness of God. That's what celebration is about. Well, let me go on that very vein just a little further here, because I want to say a few words about our lives as a whole as ministers. How many of you know that, generally speaking, ministers now are in pretty bad condition in the United States? A lot of troubles, a lot of family breakups, a lot of disappointments. One of the main seminaries in the United States, on the average, their graduates are out of the ministry in five years. that's one of the best seminaries evangelical seminaries in the United States churches do not know how to care for ministers ministers don't know how to care for themselves it is a topic of intensive study founded by leading foundations to try to determine and this is very largely the heart of the matter see we really do need to understand that our life is not our ministry and it is not our job what God gets out of our life as I've already said is not what we accomplish but who we become and who we become is what is happening to us in the course of our ministry and we need to always be asking am I becoming a person that Jesus would be glad to say yes that guy is like me that gal is like me are we becoming that kind of person but we need to think carefully about our whole life, I want to give you a word from 1 Timothy, the fourth chapter. This is really vital for us folks to understand. Here Paul says to Timothy, let's see, I believe that is in the New Testament. Verse 16 of chapter 4 of 1 Timothy. And I hope you mark this and think about it. Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching. Persevere in these things, for as you do this, you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those that hear you. Pay attention to yourself and to the teaching. One of the things that we need to think about in connection with this theme of celebration is, if I may so put it, the obligation of joy. The obligation of joy. Joy is a primary foundation of kingdom ministry. Mother Teresa of Calcutta required that her sisters smile. and it was her view that anyone who could not smile on the people that they ministered to could not minister to them. Joy is a primary foundation of kingdom ministry flowing from vision, peace, and righteousness and reinforcing them. The joy of the Lord is our strength. it is a gift and it is a duty for a minister it is the first line of defense that we have against weakness failure and disease joy keep a merry heart now we have every right not to be full of joy if you're not full of joy no doubt you have justification But what we have to understand is that we can choose a life of joy. Now in the fruit of the Spirit, joy is the second component. Love, joy, peace. Joy is a pervasive sense of well-being. It isn't the same as pleasure. you can be joyful in sorrow and I want to just say the single thing that will help us most in order to be joyful and you have to keep this in conjunction I believe with the other things we've been talking about this afternoon but the main thing that we can do to have a life of joy is to stop trying so hard stop trying so hard direct our mind to God and to His place, our place in His world now and forever. That's the main thing that we can do. And that's why we need solitude and that's why we need silence. We need to be able to step into quietness and be at peace there. See, peace, love, joy, peace, Peace is very closely related to joy. It isn't the same thing as just not being at war. Peace is the result of the kind of fullness, the word shalom, that is used in the Old Testament to express this. It actually can hardly be captured by joy. It is by the word peace as we now understand it. It's a sense of fullness. It's a sense of fullness. It's actually a quite elevated kind of sense of well-being. And then joy is associated with that. And we need to dwell with God in silence and quietness until shalom rests on us. Solitude and silence help us with that as with many other things, see. Because in solitude and silence we can come to experience the fullness of God's life to us. We have to have that. We cannot run on fumes. We have to minister out of the fullness of our lives. And if we are content to allow ourselves to be run to death, then we will not have what we need to have in order to minister. If you fill your calendar with important appointments, you'll have no time for God. If you fill your spare time with essential reading, you'll starve your soul. if you fill your mind with worry about budget and offerings the pains in your chest and the ache in your shoulders will betray you if you try to conform to the expectations of those around you, you will be forever their slave work a modest day, then step back and rest and this will keep you close to God now see you can't do that unless you practice those disciplines you have to practice the disciplines in order to be able to do this one's daily planner tells plenty about one's spiritual formation it reveals volumes about this pastor's spiritual conditions values, fears and ambitions it tells who your what is that word? bosses are who your lover is how much value you place on your soul If you're working more than 50 hours a week, you're not doing it for God, no matter how eloquent your rationalizations. Now, this is just one pastor talking, okay? A guy named William Martin. Take a long, prayerful, meditative look at your calendar. Who are you trying to impress? God? Give me a break. The congregation? Possibly. Yourself? Bingo. Now cut some big chunks out of each week for family, rest, meditation, prayer, and flower sniffing. And when you've done that, you'll be more sensitive to the path of God. Now, it will help you, I think, to do that if you'll just visualize... Sorry about all these circle diagrams. This is you. If you will distinguish these four things. Now, I think it will help you go back to that saying about sniffing the flowers and say, okay, I can do that. Start at the center. Your job is what you're paid to do. How I earn a living. That's important. That's a good thing. It's not a bad thing. But your job is not your ministry. you still get to keep your ministry if you lose your job your ministry is that part of God's special work in my time he has specifically allotted to me that may be any kind of thing that you're doing his work special work in your time that God has committed to you it may be pastoring it may be teaching a Sunday school class leading a division of the church, working in the community, whatever it may be. God assigns work that he wants specifically done to people, and then that's their ministry. Now, it would be wonderful if that could be their job. But you almost never meet anyone who has the sense that their job coincides with their ministry. There's always a lot of stuff in the job that doesn't seem to be related to the ministry. and that by the way is not just true of folks in religious work it's true of the professions generally you know the three old professions are clergy doctor and lawyer and today in all of those professions everywhere I go to speak to groups in these sections I happen to do a good bit of that the common complaint is my job is preventing me from carrying out my calling so that's a kind of problem I'm not saying it's legitimate to say that I'm just saying that's there and we do want to distinguish our job and our ministry and then there's our work the work is the total amount of lasting goods that I will produce in my lifetime that may be any number of things that's what characterizes work by the way in the Ten Commandments when it says do no work it's talking about producing lasting goods that you depend on for your livelihood and so on work total amount of lasting goods that I'll produce in my lifetime now if you're married and you have children your children are a part of your work they are not a part of your ministry and I certainly hope they're not a part of your job. Children being presented as a part of the pastor's or the minister's ministry is one of the things that really does hurt the child and accounts for a lot of rebellion because they wind up being nice and doing what they're supposed to do for reasons that are not good reasons. mainly so that people would not criticize them for being the preacher's kid that doesn't obey. Your child is not a part of your ministry or your job. It's a part of your work. In fact, it's a main part of it. It may be something else, a building you build or a song you write. See, that can fall in the area of your work. I say, why isn't that my ministry? It isn't your ministry because this is an area in which God has given you freedom to choose and to create what you want. In your ministry, that's something God wants done. Definitely He wants that done. But in your work, you are free to be creative and to develop and to produce things that are good for the benefit of yourself and others and to the glory of God. But it's not a part of ministry. now I hope you have some things in your life that fall in that area and that you feel real good about and then beyond that is just your life your life is you it's your experiences it's who you are and that does not reduce to your ministry and it does not reduce to your work and it does not reduce to your job now please think about these distinctions because if you don't make them you are apt to trap yourself into a way of life that will keep you from having the time available to exercise the disciplines that will enable you to grow spiritually. And there's so much more we could say about this but one of the things that's very likely to happen is you're going to exhaust your body you're going to push it beyond the limits and you're going to suffer burnout. And in a state of burnout, there's no telling what will happen. I will tell you this, that nearly every minister I have known of who, as we say, fell, fell because they felt like they deserved something which was wrong. And they were exhausted, and they felt they were not rewarded sufficiently. And so why not take a little extra money? Or a little whatever, you know. Because after all, I am an unhappy person and I should be happy. I should have joy. I should have peace. I don't have it. I'm sacrificing myself for the ministry. God never told anyone to do that. I assure you he never did that. Don't think bad things about God. that's a general rule you can follow. Don't think bad things about God. Don't believe that. He's not like that. And he's not short on supplies. So we need to understand that. And once we make these distinctions, you see, then I believe we can have the place to make decisions that are good. Not just for us personally, because we're setting patterns for our congregations, for the people we lead. We need to tell others about this. We have people all around us, if this is anywhere near normal as a church, we have people all around us that are ruining their families and ruining their lives, because they think their life is their job. I heard one set of statistics from an insurance company that said, the average life of a man in this country who retires at 65, The average life beyond that is 18 months. And you know why that's true? That's because they didn't know that their life was not their job. And people die from things like that. Their body will think of some excuse to stop ticking because their life is at an end. We have an epidemic of misunderstanding and misguided faith about this, and we need to set an example that allows others to say, yes, I know that my job is different from my ministry and my work and that my life is different from all of them. And that is one of the primary ways that we can manifest the kingdom of God to those who are around us. End with a poem. Isn't that the way we're supposed to end with a poem? One, the wind one brilliant day called to my soul with an odor of jasmine. And the wind said, in return for the odor of my jasmine, I'd like all the odor of your roses. But I said, I have no roses. All the flowers of my garden are dead. And then the wind said, well, I'll take the withered petals and the yellow leaves. And the wind left and I wept. And I said to myself, what have you done with the garden that was entrusted to you? that garden is your life God gave you your life this beautiful thing and he says bring it into my kingdom bring it in lay down all of the back breaking burdens that's why Jesus said all you who labor weary labor back broken come to me and I'll give you rest. Whatever burden you're carrying today you can bring that to him in his kingdom. You turn it loose and your soul will thrive. We need to tell young people this. They bear seconds today to succeed to make it. We need to tell old people this who think their life is over because they're old. We need to say it to the strong man or woman in the midst of their life. Take care of your soul. Take care of your soul. You want to minister the kingdom of God to people not where you address them. And they will hear. And we can speak out of the authenticity of our own lives to their need. And God will bless it. and the river will flow. Lord, when we contemplate all these things, we realize how inadequate we are even to grasp them, and sometimes it's almost like we're looking at the dawning light or the aurora borealus that we don't really understand. We can sort of see it flashing over there. But as we leave this room today, we ask that you would please remind us of the garden that you have given us, and give us eyes of love to see those around us in the same light and let your kingdom come into our midst that we might blossom with your life. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
