I pray for revelation, ability to see you. And I pray it in Jesus' name, amen. Last week, in the context of our dealing with the eighth and final beatitude, where Jesus made it clear to those fresh-faced young disciples of his sitting on the hill that day in Matthew 5, that among the things they should expect if they were serious about following his way of living and loving and being was suffering and pain. The eighth beatitude was, blessed are those who are persecuted on account of me. So persecution as well. I asked a question. The question was this. So what were you expecting? When you signed on for this Jesus journey, for this rabbi's way of living and loving and being, what kind of life did you expect? And we did a lot of work around that question. Today, another question. The question is this. Born of this same beatitude, do you ever wonder if it's worth it? particularly if you've begun to taste the eighth beatitude of what Jesus said we should expect suffering and pain persecution as well when you begin to taste a little of that you ever wonder if it's worth it because if you do or ever have this word today's for you and it's coming from John, who I told you last week was the only one of the original 12 of those young kids, really, sitting around Jesus in Matthew 5, hearing the declaration of the kingdom. He was the only one of the 12 who wouldn't die a martyr's death. Instead, he died in exile, alone, on an island called Patmos, where God gave to him a gift that today I'd like to give to you, particularly to those of you who've maybe begun to wonder if it's worth it. It was called the Revelation. It became a book in the Bible of no small controversy. The book of Revelation is just a weird book. If you know anything at all about it, you know that. But the word revelation comes from the Greek word apocalypsis, meaning simply to unveil or to reveal. Because the primary purpose of the book of revelation is to unveil, is to reveal, among other things, primarily Jesus to some people who had begun to lose sight of Jesus. Ever happen to you? You just lose sight of him. It can happen for a lot of reasons. It can happen for suffering. We'll talk about that this morning, but it can happen for success. It can happen when you get busy, even busy for God. You know, in these last several weeks, months, we've been dealing with a revelation, if you will, of Jesus as a rabbi, and it's open for me and I think for you doors into rooms of understanding of Jesus as a master teacher who's calling us to follow in his way. But today, the revelation that we're going to deal with and the revelation that John gets when he's on this island of Patmos was a revealing of Jesus, not in his humanity, which is a good thing to look at, but today it's a revelation of Jesus in all of his glory and his majesty and his power, the kind of revelation that makes you fall on your knees. Follow him. I can't even move when I see Jesus revealed this way. And this revelation was coming specifically to a group of people who were scared and struggling. A group of people in Asia Minor, seven churches, actually, that were actual churches. And we'll hear them named in just a moment. But they kind of stand symbolically for every church in every age who in that particular day, because of Rome's relentless commitment to literally and physically try and wipe them off the face of the earth, had begun to wonder if it was worth it. If God's promises were true, if their future hope was secure, because to them at the time, Rome looked to be much bigger and much stronger even than God's. And if you've ever had a time when it looks like Rome is winning, whatever Rome might be for you, if you've ever had a time when it looks like Satan's winning, when what's happening in the world, forget the world in your life is just plain wrong and you can't fix it, you can't change it, then maybe you know a little bit of how they felt. So today, the unveiling, the revelation of Jesus begins with these words. Revelation chapter 1 verse 9, I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation. I'm in this with you. We're all suffering here. And the kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus was on an island called Patmos precisely because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet saying, write down in a book what you see, John, and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, and to Thyatira, to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, And also to lay at a sea. right hand, he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in its strength. But when I saw him, you guys, when I looked at him, I fell at his feet like a dead man, and then he laid his right hand on me and said, John, don't be afraid. It's me. Remember me. I am the first. I am the last. Some of your translations, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I am the living one. And yes, I was dead, but behold, I am alive forevermore and have in my hands the keys of death and hell right there for the things which you have seen, he did. Now, I believe that this unveiling, this revelation of Jesus to John was clearly designed to encourage the churches to which he is writing, who had begun to wonder if it was worth it. But I also believe that this revelation was given to John for John. And also for maybe some of you, but also for John to specifically reignite in him a fire that quite possibly had begun to be a flickering flame, to re-enlist the energies of this gifted and faithful servant who had undoubtedly come to believe that his usefulness to kingdom causes was over and who maybe himself had begun to wonder if it was worth it at all. Verse 9, I, John, was on the island called Patmos. Let me paint a picture of that for you. Patmos was a barren place. Get it in your mind. A rocky island, 40 miles off the coast of Asia Minor, right in the middle of the Aegean Sea. It was a penal colony, actually, a prison island. Banishment to such a place was a common form of Roman punishment. If the crime that you had committed was political, you might have some freedom to move about the island. If the crime you committed was criminal, you were usually on some sort of chain gang, breaking rocks, hard labor. Scholars debate what kind of conditions John was under. Did he have freedom to move about? Was he on a chain gang? In my view, it actually doesn't matter, though it might have to him. But in either case, John is a long way from home on Patmos, a long way from the people that he loves and who love him, and he's a long way from where his journey with Jesus started, and probably a long way from what he expected, even though Jesus told him to expect some suffering and some persecution. Remember where John's journey began? Well, one place that we could start if we were trying to kind of see the movie in our mind would be Matthew 5, where we have been. In some way, it started on that hillside with those 11 other guys. just kids in those days. So eager to follow this rabbi named Jesus. He'd been a friend of Jesus beyond just a follower, described in the Gospels as the disciple that Jesus loved. He'd heard Jesus preach with authority, minister with grace, heal the sick. He'd seen Jesus raise the dead. He'd seen him nailed to a cross, which was a horrible day. He'd also seen him rise from the dead, ascend to the Father. He was there at Pentecost. John was there at Pentecost when the clothing with power from on high was fulfilled and the Holy Spirit came in those days when Pentecost was happening. We were all so full of hope. The Spirit was landing. Miracles were happening. Visions of a changed world seemed so possible, probable. John had preached in Jesus' name and seen results. He had planted churches. He'd written a gospel that bore his name in three epistles. But by the time we come to the revelation, all of that is long past. Indeed, I think sitting on the island of Patmos had to make Pentecost feel like a lifetime ago. Indeed, most scholars believe as many as 60 years have passed. Do the math there. John, when he's getting this vision on this barren island by himself, a prison kind of experience is about 90 years old. So here he is, banished to this prison island in isolated exile, forced to suffer not death like his other disciple friends, but to suffer uselessness, what might feel like irrelevance and aloneness. He couldn't use his gifts. He couldn't preach the gospel, the joys and encouragements of fellowship and worship and learning in a community of faith. All had been cut off. the euphoria of Pentecost had clearly faded. Indeed, as Rome looks at the world, I mean, as John looks at the world right now, Rome is the ascendant power. At Pentecost, the church seemed to be the ascendant power. Not anymore. In John's view, 90 years old, the church now, by all appearance, looks to be a weak and ineffective force against what looks like unstoppable evil as embodied in Rome. I thought the kingdom had come. I thought we'd win the world. It looked so possible, even probable at Pentecost. 3,000 were saved in one day. Today, I'm alone. The island of Patmos was a real place. But as you think about it today, let the island of Patmos stand in symbol as a place of disappointment. Where you begin to wonder if it's worth it. A place where we are forced to face alone dreams unfulfilled, hopes dashed. It is a place of disillusionment and discouragement, maybe even anger at God. Indeed, the lament of John could easily have been, but God, I was faithful. And I don't know if that was his laments. In fact, he'd been warned, you know, in Matthew 5, here's what you can expect, this very kind of thing. Well, I was on Patmos, verse 9, because of the testimony of Jesus. I was here suffering this on account of him, just like Jesus said I would. Now, well, I believe that some people may avoid Patmos experiences, may never, even as I say these things, you kind of know some people have this kind of stuff, but you never have, and you maybe never will. The truth is, I think, most of us, at one time or another, will. Spend some time on the island of what I'm calling disappointment when you feel cut off from what and who you love the most, confused and disappointed with how things appear to have turned out, especially if they started really well, like they did for John at Pentecost, if that would be kind of the point of reference when hopes began to rise and we had evidence of good things to come, but not anymore. Sometimes we land on Patmos because of a sickness or a death of someone that we love. Divorce could put you on Patmos like that. In fact, divorce, if I kind of use this analogy and spread it out, might be the ultimate, it started out so full of hope dynamic. circumstances beyond your control at work or school or even in the church can put you there. The betrayal or abandonment of a trusted friend can put you there. And the truth is, some of you are there right now. When I'm on Patmos, and I do go there from time to time, I have this prayer I pray. I think I've shared this with you before. It's really simple and direct. I encourage you to make this prayer your own. It's very impassioned. It's always the same. Lord, get me out of this. Send a boat to this island so I can leave. Fix this. Make it go away. Please, oh please, oh please, oh God. And sometimes he does. Hebrews 11.33, it speaks of people who by faith escape. The edge of the sword. their patmos experience, if you will. But sometimes he doesn't. Hebrews 11.35, two verses later, speaks of people who don't escape the edge of the sword, never get off the island called Patmos. And that makes you wonder if it's worth it. I don't know if this is good news or bad news, but it's a true part of the story. The fact is this. John would never leave the island of Patmos. He would die there. The physical circumstances of his life never changing. So just for a moment, let the reality of that sink in. Because maybe that's your story. But now let this sink in as well. That Patmos was the place where Jesus was unveiled to John. Where Jesus was revealed to John in ways more glorious, profound and clear than even when John saw Jesus in the flesh. Verse 10, I was in the spirit, he says, on the Lord's day when I heard behind me this voice like the sound of a trumpet saying, write down what you see, John, and send it to these churches because they're wondering if it's worth it. So I turned to see a voice and the first thing I saw were seven golden lampstands. And in the middle of the lampstands was one like the Son of Man, the lampstands, we find out, are the churches, the lampstands, the light of the world, the light of the world. And Jesus, in the middle of those lampstands, the Son of Man, his robe was reaching to his feet. His chest was girded with a golden sash. But I need to warn you here, says John, that my words will not do justice to what I actually saw. But I'm going to give it my best shot to describe the indescribable, because his head and his hair were like wool white as snow. Verse 14, his eyes were like fire. His feet burnished bronze. His voice was like the sound of many waters. His words like a sword. His face like the sun shining in its full strength. But you need to know that when I actually saw him, verse 17, I couldn't say anything. Indeed, I fell at his feet like a dead man, and so would you. But then he tapped me on his shoulder and said, John, don't be afraid. It's me. Remember me? I am the first. I am the last. I am the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end. I am, remember this, the living one. And oh yes, I was dead. But take a real good look, which is what behold means. I am alive forevermore. And I have in my hand the keys of death and hell. So John, you're going to be okay. And so is my church, eternal. It may look like Rome is winning this battle, but they will not win the war. In fact, the war is already over. Again, it's important to dial in again, to note again that at the culmination of this wonderful experience, this vision of Christ, and no matter how wonderful it is, these visions we get, these glimpses we get from time to time go like this, and then they close. That at the end of this wonderful experience that John gets, not a single thing has changed in John's physical experience. He is still on Patmos, and Rome is still seemingly in charge, but John has come alive because he's seen something he needed to see. And you know what it was? Jesus. And he needed to see Jesus alive. Both in vision and in reality. Because sometimes we lose sight. We can't see for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it's suffering. Sometimes it's success. Being able to see him. That's something that isn't optional if you're on Patmos because if you're on Patmos, it's really hard to see. So John's got a gift. Vision. George MacDonald in his book entitled Unspoken Sermons says this about visions. I love this. Visions, he says, if they are truly visions and not wish-fulfillment dreams actually make things happen. By virtue of the vision, John the Exiled becomes John the Empowered. Rome has shut John away so his churches could neither see him nor hear him. But the Holy Spirit filled his eyes with sights and his mind with speech that have given sight and speech to Christians ever since this vision. The banishing decree of Rome was itself banished. Anybody, see, can dream up a happy ending to a story. But it's a cruel joke to the oppressed because if you dream it up, it isn't real. A vision, though, sees what is actually there, not what frustration or disappointment wish were there. In true visions, he says, we get to see what's real. and this is what he saw. Holy Spirit, help us see. Away from his churches, not knowing how they were doing, he sees the penetrating, attentive eyes of Christ. Tired and weak from his own confinement, he sees the rock-solid, burnished bronze, unshakable feet of his Lord, accustomed to speaking with authority and with love to his prone-to-wander sheep, but now with no voice at all as a prophet or a pastor, he hears the voice of his Christ. The Lord of the church, like the sound of many waters and living at the mercy of Rome's sword, he sees the word of God proceeding like a sword from the mouth of Christ and not returning void, having its intended effect. And the really good news for us is this. He wrote it down. So we could see it too. So let's look and see. Let's listen and hear. The first thing he sees, verse 13, is one like the Son of Man sitting in the middle of his church. The seven lampstands, I've already told you that, are the seven churches he's about to address in chapter 2. In chapter 3, the lampstands being a reference to, among other things, the church being the light of the world, and one like the Son of Man is clearly Christ, which means, among other things, this, that Jesus is not an absentee landlord, that Jesus did not ascend to his throne to then exercise authority and deal with his people by remote control. Beloved, we need to know and remember and be reminded again today this, that the Lord of the church is with the church, that he loves his bride and takes his place right in the middle of where she is. Moving, acting, calling, wooing. Let's look at what he was wearing. Verse 13, for he's clothed in a robe, reaching to his feet, and girded across his breast with a golden sash. weird stuff. What it is, however, is the garb of both a king and a priest. And in his priestly function, Jesus is in the middle of his church, presenting his church to God. This is what a priest does. And presenting God to us, the way we know God, is because Jesus has revealed him to us, for he has made and is continuing to make, even now, is continuing to make access for people like you and like me into the presence of God by opening up routes that were closed, closed by our sin and our shame and our guilt and our fear. And he did it by a new and living way that he inaugurated through his very flesh, says the writer of Hebrews in Hebrews 10, and his hair, let me tell you about his hair, it's like wool, white as snow, and his eyes were like fire. I love this piece because the hair head was white and his eyes that were penetrating. Speaks of two things. Number one, that he knows. Number two, that he sees. The knowing thing is drawn from his hair. His head and his hair were white like wool, white as snow. How many of you know that in our culture, white hair, gray hair is usually a thing to be avoided? get all these pictures of me when I, you know, I send, when I go speak someplace, I send them pictures of me 20 years ago. Actually, I don't do that. I love, I, every hair, I earned it. That's what I'm thinking. In our culture, the only thing worse than white hair is what? No hair. Not so in scripture. And it's not, you know what, it's not about white hair. It's not, it's, the symbolism of this is powerful. Proverbs 16, 31 says, white hair is a crown of splendor. Why? Because it looks good. No. No. Because it speaks symbolically to a kind of wisdom that some people have. And the reason they have it is because they've been around long enough to know some things that you can't know until you've just been around and been through. So when Jesus identifies himself in verse 17 as the Alpha beginning and Omega end, the first and the last, the ancient of days. He's saying, among other things, this. I was there at the beginning. I will be there at the end. I am the ancient of days, which means, again, among other things, that there are some things I know that you don't know, some things I see that you don't see, like the beginning and the end. So I know, says God, all about your present circumstance, circumstance. Indeed, to the seven churches of the revelation, he kind of dresses some of that out in chapter 2, verse 2. He says, I know, I see, I know your deeds, he says to the church in Ephesus, your toil and perseverance, and that you haven't endured evil men. You stood against some things. I see that, I know that. And I know your tribulation, church, and Smyrna, your poverty and your persecution. I'm aware of that. I see that, that Pergamum, that you dwell where Satan's throne is, that you've held fast my name in the middle of that. And I know you're discouraged, and I know you're wondering if it's worth it. But I also know the rest of the story. For I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I am the first and the last, the Ancient of Days. And what I know that you don't know is this, that this awful thing you're in right now, John, is not the end of the story for you. And as scary as it is right now, know this, that it does not have the power to define your identity, nor does it have the power to determine your destiny. His hair, white like wool, means he knows. His eyes, like a flame of fire, means he sees. Which brings me to one of my all-time favorite dad stories. I've told you this before more than once. I love the picture, particularly how it dials into this story. I was in high school. Playing football on what was probably the worst, you know, football team in the Chicago Public League history ever. I was 185 pounds as a high school kid. I played tackle. And if you know anything about football, you'd say, what? That's too small. Hello. though. In two years of varsity football, I think we won two games. One particularly memorable week, we were about to play a school that hadn't lost a game in two years. And in the middle of the week, an article appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times that was featuring the guy that was playing tackle for them. So that meant I was going to be dealing with him all game long. He was about 6'5", 260, going to Michigan on a full ride. He'd be my guy all day, both ways, which means I played offense and defense. I played every play. And you go, you must have been good. Our team stunk. I remember a lot of things about that day. I remember that it was really hot. The field was dusty, hard as a rock. I remember that we lost the game. I remember that it wasn't close. I remember I held my ground, but I got pounded all day, every play. Another thing I remember about that day was that my dad was there. And part of the reason I remember that he was there was because hardly anybody else was. And so he wasn't hard to spot. See, I could see him right at the top of the bleachers. Every play, following the line of scrimmage. There was times I wish he'd go away. But he didn't. Up and down the field, all day long, every play. And you know what? He didn't rescue me. Stop hitting my son. He didn't rescue me. He didn't fix it. But his eyes were like a flame of fire, which means he saw. And his hair was white like wool because he was old. Dads are old. They're just old. But many knew. And what he knew, among other things was this. He knew that we would lose the game. He had a prophetic gift. And he knew that I was getting pounded. And he knew that sometimes I was even being embarrassed by this guy. And he knew that I would be discouraged and might even want to quit. But he also knew some things I didn't know. And the reason he knew him was because he was the ancient of days. He'd been around. He saw some things I couldn't see, partly because I was 17, and I didn't have the big picture at 17. And all I could see at 17 was that game, Pac-Moss. That's all I could see. And what my dad knew, though, that I didn't know, and what he saw that I couldn't see was that that football game, indeed that entire season of my life, did not have the power to define my identity or determine my destiny, and it helped me to know that he knew that. See, I was getting pounded, says John. On the island of Patmos, my dreams were dashed, my hopes were destroyed. I was beginning to wonder if it was worth it at all, but then I turned to see a voice. And having turned, I saw him right at the top of the bleachers, right in the middle of the lampstands, and his hair like wool was white as snow, he knew, and his eyes were like a flame of fire. He saw, and what he knew that I didn't know, says John, and what he saw that I couldn't see was that this place of shattered dreams and bitter disappointment called Patmos did not have the power to define John's identity or determine his destiny. Because I know, says the Lord of the church, the rest of the story and the rest of the story is this. We win, John. So write what you see. Be faithful to the end. Are you glad that he was faithful, that he did what he was told and wrote it down? I am because now we get to see it and we get to hear it 2,000 years later that his feet were like burnished bronze. Now, that part of the picture is significant because John is borrowing that from a dream that Daniel had of Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar kind of embodied in Daniel's day, what Rome embodied in John's day. Nebuchadnezzar in this dream was enormous, just bigger than life and invincible. But there was this one place where there was weakness in Nebuchadnezzar. It was in the foundation somehow of his life because his feet were made of clay, which means eventually, in spite of all of his strength, an invisible posturing, his feet of clay would be his undoing. His foundation wasn't solid. And Kenezer eventually was going down, and so was Rome. But the foundation, the feet, upon which the kingdom of God is built, and upon which your future hope relies, is solid, unshakable, burnished bronze, and his voice was like the sound of many waters. It's hard to discern specific words when it's just rushing water. In fact, I couldn't tell you what he said, But his words were like a sword, piercing, revealing, and his face was shining like the sun in the fullness of its strength. And then I see John stopping here and saying again, you know, I'm doing the best I can to come up with words that might describe what is indescribable, but I want you to know that when I actually saw him, verse 17, I didn't say anything. Indeed, I fell at his feet like a dead man, But then he tapped me on the shoulder and said, Don't be afraid. It's me. Remember me? You need to remember me. I am the first and the last. I am the Alpha and the Omega. I am the living one. Oh, yeah, I was dead. But take a real good look, for I am alive forevermore. And I have in my hand the keys of death and hell, which means, among other things, you're going to be okay, John, and so is my church eternal. Rome might look like they win the battle here and there, but they will not win the war. In fact, the war is already over, so get to work, John. What do you think, John, that just because you're trapped on a prison rock by the most powerful and oppressive government known to man, I couldn't use you? Pick up a pen and write what you see. And 2,000 years later, they'll still be talking about it. We close with a question. What's your place of disappointment where you've begun to wonder if it's worth it? Well, I can't fix it for you. And I can't make it go away. but here's the word of the morning don't be afraid it's me remember me I'm the Alpha and Omega the first and the last I am the Ancient of Days which means among other things that I know some things that you don't know and see some things that you can't see and among the things I know and see that you don't know and can't see is this, that whatever it is that's convinced you that you're done does not have the power to define your identity or determine your destiny because I am with you. My eyes are upon you. I see you. Can you see him? Because he is glorious. you
