Galatians chapter 5 verse 16 in our continuing study in this exciting book. I'm going to read this morning through the 23rd verse, though we are not going to study that long. I want you to get the context. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. for these are in opposition to one another so that you may not do the things that you please. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are no longer under the law. You are not under the law. Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, they're obvious, which are immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, hatreds, literally, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these of which I forewarn you just as I have forewarned you before that those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law. Would you pray with me and for me and open your heart to the things that the Spirit of God would teach us this morning? Father, again I come to your word and am overwhelmed with this reality and power, with this glory. And yet I am again overwhelmed with the fact that expressing it and teaching it, and even if we say it right, doesn't bring these powerful spiritual realities about in our living. And we call on your Spirit to teach us. We call on your Spirit to change us. Do your work among us this morning in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. The book of Galatians, as you know from our study so far, is what is called a polemic epistle. Polemic means simply this. It is argumentative. It is controversial. It is disputing. That is its nature. That's what it does. And it creates tension, the book of Galatians does. Most of us don't like tension. Most of us, when we think of a Bible study or a sermon or coming to church, when we even think of our own personal Bible study. We don't think of something that's going to produce tension in our livings. Bible studies and reading the Word of God and preaching the Word of God is supposed to be soothing and comforting and serene. You see, the picture I get in my mind of someone who is in the Word is not someone who's necessarily struggling and fighting with the Word of God to understand it and even let it change him. But, you know, you have this picture of someone sitting in his little recreation room with a fireplace going in and a nice easy chair and a cup of coffee, and it's just soothing and comforting. That's the way it is sometimes, but not here. Not in the book of Galatians. And the reason is this, because Paul is taking this message of freedom, he is taking this message of liberty and spirit-induced living, and he is pushing it to the max. He is pushing it to the extreme. He is saying to these Galatian believers, Galatians, you need to decide right now, how are you going to live? Are you going to live on the basis of faith? Are you going to live on the basis of freedom? Are you going to live by the power of the Holy Spirit? Or are you going to live on the basis of your self-effort? Are you going to live in bondage? Are you going to live on the power of your own flesh? What you need to see, Galatians, is that you have been trying to have it both ways. You have been trying to talk spirit. You have been talking indwelt power. But you have been living according to the principles of your own self-effort. And Paul is saying to them, listen, you can't have it both ways. That creates tension. I want you to notice something here, just kind of to capture something new, a new dimension of our study. When we call the book of Galatians a polemic, argumentative book, the argument is not going on necessarily with the Galatians. We know who's arguing, right? Paul is arguing with the Judaizers. You know what? In this argument, I don't think Paul is the one feeling the tension. I don't even think the Judaizers are the ones feeling the tension. The ones feeling the tension are the Galatians. They're kind of in the middle. Paul's not going to change. He says it is faith, it is freedom, nothing else. You mix in your little self-effort. It is no longer spirit, it is your self-effort. I won't have a thing to do with it. The Judaizers are saying just exactly the opposite. Nothing's going to change them. The pressure, the tension is being applied to these Galatians who are being torn. They're kind of in the middle. You ever feel like that? What's happening to them in their Christian life is it is creating a spirit of unsettledness. It is creating a spirit of a sort of confusion because how they are living is being challenged. Paul is coming and bluntly saying to them, listen, folks, if you want to have victory, if you want to have real life, you are going to have to drop the law. You are going to have to drop all your external controls that are causing you to act like a Christian, and you are going to have to start living by the Spirit. no other way you're going to have to decide that creates tension that creates tension and it was there let's kind of catch up here a little bit in terms of where Paul is with the study his argument so far has progressed very well the first point of attack was simply this you need to know Galatians that theologically you were not saved salvation did not come by the works of the law they did not come by your self-effort it came by faith and the spirit of God right? everybody goes right We know that. Fine. They understand it. Theologically, they understood and affirmed the freedom and grace, no law, and they understood that in relation to salvation. But we need to understand something, and this brings us right to where we are in our study. In their living, to a Jew, the law was like a dam. And I think for some of us, it's the same thing. This picture will help you, I think. for the Jew, even one who would be saved. The law is like a dam, and that dam holds back all the waters of sin. Okay? That's the kind of picture they have in terms of how they live their life. We need the law because that's the restrainer we have. And that's the only restrainer there is to hold back sin and to produce holy living. Now, you know, you have this guy named the Apostle Paul coming along, and he is preaching freedom. He is saying heretical things like, you're not under law. And to the Jew, while Paul does not mean at all that results in sin, to the Jew who sees the only restrainer for sin being the law, he hears something that Paul isn't saying. He hears this. You're just going to blow that dam up, and the waters of sin are just going to flow and destroy the whole thing. And so something of tension wells up in that person. There is no other restrainer. One of the things we have to understand is this, That for the unregenerate, for the natural born, for the pharisaical type that we have described so many weeks previous to this, there is no other restrainer. For one who does not have the Holy Spirit of God, who is not reborn by his faith in Jesus Christ, there is no other restrainer. All you would have would be external laws that would keep you in line. But for the redeemed, there is the indwelling spirit. And that indwelling spirit preempts the need for those walls to be there. The problem is an awful lot of Christians don't live according to the indwelling spirit. They live as if the only power they have to restrain themselves are external walls. Paul wants to liberate them from that. The problem is this, that because this question is there, Paul needs to answer it. Again, what is the question? The question is this. If you take away the law, if you talk about freedom, it's just going to result in license. People are just going to use their freedom to do whatever they feel like doing. So it is that the apostle Paul says, listen, you need to understand some things about freedom. First of all, this happened, this is where we were two weeks ago. You remember it started in verse 13. Paul says, first of all, you need to understand that freedom is not the freedom to indulge in the flesh. You were called to freedom, verse 13, brethren. Only don't turn or twist or pervert your freedom into, excuse me, into an opportunity for the flesh. It is not freedom to indulge the flesh. Secondly, it is not freedom to injure others. Same verse, but through love, serve one another. It is also not freedom to ignore the law. Verse 14, for the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. We went into that several weeks ago. Question, however, still stands. And if you're fighting with these concepts, I would imagine that for you the question still stands. Okay, Paul, you've told me somehow theologically or theoretically that freedom does not result in indulging in the flesh. But I have still got a problem, you see, because I am having a problem still reconciling freedom, producing holiness. You see, inside of my spirit, whenever you talk about freedom and no law and no restrictions and no restrainer, other than the Holy Spirit, I know, you know, what happens inside me is I literally kind of loosen up. I kind of, I start to float. I start to think that it doesn't matter. And I just kind of coast along, read the word, no big deal. Pray, no big deal. Ministering free, it's great. And I think I understand this freedom thing, but you got to tell me, Paul, how that works. How do you reconcile this absolute freedom that you just militantly stand on with holy living? How do you do that? Paul gives his answer in verse 16. He says this, But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. There's your answer. There it is. And the person who's struggling with this just goes, I knew you were going to say that. I knew you were going to say that. That's a goofy answer. It doesn't work for me. this Holy Spirit thing you know just walk by the Spirit it's kind of a floaty thing you know the symbol of the Holy Spirit is a dove and a dove just kind of floats on me and kind of rests on me and I'll just kind of float along and I'll just kind of move my hands and I'll be obedient now and I'll just all these wonderful feelings will well up in me and it doesn't work for me it doesn't work for me well what works for you? you don't like that answer not clear enough I need something more tangible okay what works for you what what do you do what do you do to to produce holy living in your life what do you do to to keep on serving and keep on giving and keep on loving what do you do what is it in you that works that produces holiness for you well it isn't just floating along and and just kind of thinking the holy spirit's gonna dump on me and i'm gonna just do all these wonderful things laws rules regulations doing it right is that what it is for you tick tick tick check check Chick. Do it right. Discipline yourself. Is that what you do? Laws. Laws. External things. Tell me what to do. What not to do. And I conform to those laws. Great. Great. Is that what you do? Is that also why? Is that also why? With all that regimentation and all those things that keep you in line and that tick, tick, tick and that check, check, check. Is that why? Is that what explains that what is exuding from you is this incredible peace and patience and gentleness. Is that what explains that? Beloved, you may not like Paul's answer right there. You may not yet understand Paul's answer right there. It may be that in your Christian life, you have not yet tapped the incredible resources of the Holy Spirit so that in your living that makes any sense right now in your life. But I want to tell you something. The answer is there. That's it. What I need to do is somehow come to grips by the teaching of the Holy Spirit that teaches the Spirit in me and by the Word of God to come to grips with what that means because that's the secret right here. We need to know right now, unequivocally, the only answer there is to produce holy living in me is walking by the Spirit. Freedom, holiness, right together, walk by the Spirit. What do you mean? What does it mean to walk by the Spirit? What do you do? How do you do it? All sorts of ideas on how to walk by the Spirit. Beloved, we're going to go on a voyage these next couple of weeks. One of the things that has struck me as I was studying this week is the frustration. I say this every Sunday and I think you've got to get tired of this, but the frustration to somehow with words express something that is supernatural and that it is about God. And I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to bring my heart to this and do everything I can to, with words, explain and paint pictures for you to see. But I'm no different than you. I'm in the process myself of understanding these things and seeing them borne out in my life. So I share with you today. We want to learn and grow in this. But I want you to help me. One of the things I'm so excited about on Wednesday night is that we're going to take some of these things that we're going to tear apart here in the pulpit. And we're going to come Wednesday night and do it some more. You know why? One thing I need to learn from you. There are insights that you will have in this text that I won't see. So we come together and we learn. Iron sharpens iron. We're going to jump into it right now. You know what I want to do? I want to pray again. I want to pray. This is so vital to me. And this is so about God and us. Let's just pray again. Lord, as we talk about your spirit who lives in us, energize us, give us eyes to see, so that we, some of us, for the first time, can experience the things we say we believe. Amen. I want you to notice something real quickly. This is a key thought. It's something we focus on, and it's going to kind of permeate our whole study. There is only one imperative in this entire text. There is only one command in this entire text. This is very important that you understand. There is only one thing that I must do. It says this, walk by the Spirit. Do it. You are commanded to do it. Everything else, right down through verse 26, is not a command to do something. It is a statement of fact. Walk by the Spirit. Command. Imperative. Fact. If you walk by the Spirit, you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. Fact. Statement of fact. The flesh sets its desire against the spirit. Fact. Spirit sets its desire against the flesh. That's a fact. If you are led by the spirit, you are not under law. That's a fact. Deeds of the flesh are evident. Immorality, impurity. I want you to know something. I want you to see something. Before we even give you an outline or anything, I want you to see that the deeds of the flesh, when it says they are immorality, impurity, there is not a command in there saying, okay, Christian, don't be immoral. Don't be impure. Don't be angry. Don't be involved in dissensions. Don't be involved in factions. what it is saying is this. If you are controlled by the flesh, that will be there. Those things will be the result. But if you are led by the Spirit, the fruit of the Spirit is love. So love, no. Walk by the Spirit, you will love. Walk by the Spirit, you will have peace. Walk by the Spirit, you will have patience. You can't produce any of those things. You've heard that a million times. I want you to know that just at the very beginning. There's only one command in this thing. Everything else is an imperative. Let me give you the outline. This is the outline we're going to have for the next couple of weeks Point number one. We have a command. I've already given that to you. Verse question verse verse 16 Walk in the spirit walk not walk in the spirit walk by the spirit. I'm going to clarify that in a few minutes walk by the spirit. There is no question that is not an option that is not an option you do it that is not floating along waiting for some dove to fall on you walk in the spirit by the spirit number two the conflict after the command comes the conflict that's in verses 17 through 17 through 18 the flesh sets its desire against the spirit the spirit against the flesh you're going to find this tremendously helpful because what it's going to do some of you are growing in the lord and some of you are beginning more and more to strip off some of the externals that have always controlled your life and you have moved into tension and frustration and fear in your own spirit you've never known in your christian life this verse is going to explain that to you it's going to tell You ought to expect that. Number three is the contrast. The contrast between walking according to the flesh and then walking according to the Spirit, verses 19 through 23. And then finally in verses 24 through 26, the conquest. Okay, ready? Let's go. Walk by. Stop right there. Walk by the Spirit. What does that mean? How do we do it? Before we even get into walking by the Spirit, I'm always doing something before we get into it, aren't I? Before we get into walking by the Spirit, I think there's something I need to clarify and nail down for your own heart and for your own mind. And that is this. Before we speak even one word about what it means to walk by the Spirit, you need to establish whether or not the Spirit is there. You see, there's a problem for some people here, and that is this, that some of you who are with us this morning do not have the presence of the Holy Spirit within you. You do not have the presence of the Holy Spirit within you. You are not regenerated. You are not redeemed. There is no way, beloved, for you to walk this way. There is absolutely no possible way for you to walk according to the Spirit. So the possibility of that, when we talk about these things, walking by the Spirit, it's going to sound so strange to you and so bizarre to you, you won't even get it. 1 Corinthians 2, verses 13 through 14 indicate this, that the natural man perceiveth not the righteousness of God. Why? Because these things that we're talking about are spiritually appraised. You're going to have to have spiritual life to put them together. Can't do it. But there's another problem. There's another problem in walking by the Spirit and really being able to grasp it and understand it. Some of you are indeed new creatures in Christ. Some of you have been transformed by the blood of Christ and have in you the Holy Spirit dwelling, the life of God in you. But you know what? Even though all those things are true, for many of you, you have never grasped or either understood or even really believed that God really is in you. The fact is this, that while you are a Christian, you have never, ever really lived your life according to the power of the Holy Spirit. You have lived your life according to those things that are natural. You maybe have grown up in a Christian home and the control on your life has always been something external, some sort of law, some sort of rule, some sort of code of behavior that you thought you needed to do and you did it. And right now you are a good little Christian. Oh my goodness, it's wonderful. And no one would doubt it and I don't doubt it that you are a Christian, that the Spirit of God is in you. But even as you look at your own spirit and into your own life, when we talk about words like this, power, power, and glory. Those are words that are a little bit strange to you. We kind of nod our head, yeah, power, glory, yeah, okay. But see, the problem is you really have never plunged the depths of the reality of who you are and what you have in Jesus because the Spirit in you is there, but you aren't even living as if He is. And I don't mean that because that means you're all disobedient. I mean that the resource for your power is yourself. not the spirit you have in you for some of you for those of you who are naturally born don't have the spirit of God the things I'm going to talk to you about now are impossible not even in the realm of possibility for those of you who have been Christians maybe many many years but have never tapped the resource of the spirit in you these lessons are going to be hard you know why? because we are going to threaten and we are going to tear away all the external things about your Christianity that give you security and keep you in control to liberate you to the Holy Spirit. So it'll be scary for some of you. Let it be scary. Let it be. Let it be. Principle number one I've got to give you right here. If you are a Christian, you have the Holy Spirit. If you are a Christian, you have the Holy Spirit. Romans 8 verse 9 says this, If you do not have the Holy Spirit, if the Spirit of Christ does not dwell in you, fact. You are none of His. Fact is this. And you know what? I'm not telling you anything that every one of you don't agree with. Oh, yes. Spirit of God in me. When I got saved, the Spirit indwelt. I know that theologically. I know that word. The Spirit indwells every believer. Let me take it a little step further to try to expose to you whether or not you really do grasp that. The essence of Christianity. The definition of Christianity. The distinction of Christianity. What separates Christianity from every other religion or way to God or anything is not doctrine. It is not theology. It is not a belief system. What is it? It is the fact that Jesus died on the cross and that he rose again, right? It's even more than that. What? Yes, it's even more than that. The essential power separating ingredient of Christianity from everything else is the fact that when Jesus died, and when he rose again, something miraculous took place and that is this. God came and lived in me. Holy Spirit in the human being. When I was preaching in Hebrews, remember we were always going through Hebrews and we were comparing the old covenant with the new covenant. Remember? And we got all excited because oh, we're in the new covenant and we're not under law and we haven't come to Mount Sinai and we don't have to struggle and we don't have to bring all our sacrifices week by week, day by day to the temple. Oh man, we're forgiven and it's wonderful and we gloried in that. And that's tremendous. But I want to tell you something. That Old Testament saint, remember when he was bringing his sacrifice and he was living under the bondage of the law, under the curse and under the bondage of Mount Sinai? When he would pray and he would know that the Messiah was coming, what do you think he looked for? What do you think he anticipated would be the distinction between how he was living now and how he would live then? What was it? Oh, Lord. I wish he had a Jewish accent. I can't do it. Lord, I can't wait till you come and bring your Messiah, your Redeemer, because I'm getting tired of this law. I'm so tired of bringing my sacrifice and never feeling clean, and I'm so tired of that. Would you please get your Messiah to come and pray daily that the Messiah would come so I wouldn't have to... It's such a heavy thing. It's such a hard thing. I would just want to get rid of it. No, that wasn't what he looked for. It wasn't what he looked at because that wasn't the only distinction of the Old Covenant and the New Covenant. The only distinction of the Old Covenant and the New Covenant is not that we're not under law anymore. The distinction between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant is this. Now the Spirit of God is indwelling me. Look at this. Ezekiel, the prophet, was hearing from God what the New Covenant was going to be like. And the promise was this. Ezekiel, here's the issue right here. When the Messiah comes and Jesus dies and rises again, here's the distinction. I will put my spirit in you. And they said, oh, Lord, come. Lord, come. Why? Why was that such an important thing? You know why? Because the law was there, and that Old Testament saint wanted like crazy to fulfill that law. He wanted like crazy, but he kept bumping up against it and couldn't do it. And he never had the ability to do it because the spirit wasn't in him. And the promise of the new covenant was that God would be in me. Goes on in that same verse. I will put my spirit in you. And he will move in you and cause you to follow my decrees. And be careful to keep my laws. And they would cry, Lord, come. Because I love your law, but I can't keep it. I love your law, but I can't keep it. And then Jesus in John 7 verses 38 and 39 said this. Whoever believes in me, this is before the Spirit came, right? Whoever believes in me, streams of living water will flow from him. What? What does that mean? It goes on to say, By this he meant the Spirit. By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believe in him were later to receive. Aha! It's a second work, you see. You get saved and then you receive the Spirit later. No, no, no, no, no. It doesn't mean that. Not here. But, you see, up to that point, I'm reading now in verse 39, up to that point the Spirit had not yet come, had not yet been given, since Jesus himself had not yet been glorified. The thing they were looking for when Jesus would die and rise again and Jesus' glorification was that now the Spirit would come and live in me. What happened when Jesus came? What happened was we were forgiven, we went to the new covenant, we were redeemed, we were regenerated. But all those things happened and the law was set aside. Why was the law set aside? because he just decided to give us a break. No. The reason the law was set aside was because you don't need it anymore. Why is that? Because you've got the Spirit of God in you. Acts 1.8, he said this, you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. Before Jesus died and rose again, that wasn't there. Romans 8.9, you are not in the flesh. John read it. But you are what? In the Spirit. You've got a whole new identity. You are not living in the flesh, meaning you are not living in the natural. You are living in the supernatural. But if anyone does not have the Spirit in him, he's none of his. Beloved principle number one is if you're a Christian, if you have placed your trust in Christ, the Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God is in you with power. Okay, I'm adding those words on purpose. With power. Question going up in every one of your minds. If that is true, David, why do I not experience that power? Two reasons I already gave them to you. One reason is you don't have them. That's one reason. And I think if you never experienced the power of the Spirit, if you never ever experienced the work of the Spirit, producing love, joy, peace, long-suffering, if all of that is always your self-effort, you need to look real hard as to whether you are a supernaturally born son of Abraham or a naturally born son of Abraham who just responded to external pressure to do what mommy and daddy told you to do. You need to look at that. That's one possibility. There is another possibility that you're not receiving or experiencing the power of the Spirit to produce a holy life. And that is this. That you either don't know He's really there. You don't know the ramifications of His presence. You don't understand the implications of His presence. You don't know who He is or what He is there to do. You've maybe never ever tapped the power that is in you. What do I do? I have a big experience. Let's go to a meeting. No, no. Not here anyway. Maybe somewhere else you can get that. You don't know about the resource. If you don't know about the power, if you don't know about the glory that is in you, you will never act on it. That's where teaching comes in. I love John MacArthur. Every once in a while, I get a chance to hear him on the radio. And one of the things, they always introduce the things, you can't act on principles you don't know. If you are not bathing in the fact that God lives in you, you'll never be able to act on that principle. He's there. He's dwelling in you, but if you have not bathed yourself in that, if you don't believe that or you have forgotten that, you'll never be able to act on that, ever. You see, I believe that many Christians live their entire Christian lives in the confines of natural principles. Those natural principles are good. They look good. They are about being right, doing good, trying hard. They are rules and regulations and laws that restrain you and keep you pure. You see? Those are the things that as a Christian I've lived my whole life using those little things to keep me in line. I've gone to Sunday school and I've learned what I should do and what I shouldn't do. And I try real hard not to do those things. And I've lived my whole Christian life with the power of the Spirit in me but not drawing on that power to do any of that. Just using all those externals to keep me in line. But I've never even known what it means to be born along by the Holy Spirit of God in holiness, born along by the Spirit of God in Christlikeness, born along by the Spirit of God in purity and power. Always, it's been my Christian effort to be good. And I am good, but it isn't about power. It isn't about glory. But I say to you, walk by the Spirit. I say to you, Walk by the Spirit. What does that mean? Here we are again, back at the beginning. Isn't this frustrating? Hope not. Walk by the Spirit. Walk by. Let me give you those two words right now. First of all, I want to tell you what it doesn't mean. Take some notes here if you're interested. What it doesn't mean is walk by the Spirit, as in there's a Spirit and I walk by. Bye. Bye. See you, Spirit. I come Sunday morning. Spirit's here. Hi, Spirit. Bye. Kind of plugged in, get a little charge. See you later, alligator. It's wonderful. Walk by the Spirit. Obviously, that doesn't mean walk by the Spirit. Leave them there. I'll just keep going. I want you to know something else it doesn't mean. And I think it's important that we understand this. It doesn't mean walk next to the Spirit. As in, put your hand in the hand of the man who still the water. Remember that one? Wonderful song. Everybody gets a tear in their eye. It doesn't mean that. It doesn't mean that. You don't put your hand in the hand of the man who still the waters and you kind of walk next to him. Walking by the Spirit doesn't mean walk with God. I walk with God. Aren't you glad I don't sing? Oh, there are a variety of gifts. And one of that is not one of mine. I walk with God. That's a wonderful concept. Another one that brings a tear to my eye. And I just want to walk with God. You don't walk with God. There was only one person who walked with God. That was Enoch. He never came back. You don't walk with God. Get this right. I think it's important that we think straight on these things. You know what else it doesn't mean? I don't know if some of your translations say this, but some of your translations, I believe, say walk in the Spirit. It doesn't mean that. There's a real problem even in the Greek. The word walk there is in the instrumental case. And it means literally walk by the Spirit. It's careful. I think it's important that we understand it doesn't mean walk in the Spirit. As if there's a Spirit box, and I get in this Spirit box, and as long as I walk in this Spirit box, I won't be able to get out and do anything bad. Just walk in the Spirit. Doesn't mean that. Boy, this is where the Spirit's really going to have to teach us, because these concepts are going to stretch your brain a little bit. They've been driving me crazy all week. Walk by the Spirit means more than that. To walk by the Spirit literally means, and this is drawn right out of the text so you can be confident about this, it's not something I just made up. This is where I got it. It means literally by the means of the Spirit. Now, you connect that a little bit and you might even be able to go a little ways with that in the light of what I just gave you. The Spirit of God is in me. If I'm a believer, the Spirit of God is in me. The key to freedom and holy living is walking by means of what I already have. Got it? Walking by the Spirit means walking on the basis of what I already have. It is walking according to who I am, who Jesus says I am, and who I am indeed. The glory of the Christian life is not me walking with God, putting my hand in His and going for a walk. It is not being in a Spirit box. The glory of the Christian life is 2 Corinthians 6.16. You are the temple of the living God. I've always heard that verse meaning you are the temple of the living God, so don't sin. Well, that would follow, wouldn't it? Of course, if I'm the temple of the Holy Spirit, if I'm the temple of God, don't sin. I wouldn't sin. I want you to catch the glory of that passage for a change. You are the temple of God. You are the dwelling place of God. Do you get the idea that the distinction of Christianity is that God lives in me? It goes on in that very verse. If I can find it here. It goes on in that verse. And it says, not only are you the temple of the living God, but just as God has said, I will live in them and dwell in them. And get this, walk in them. I want you to picture that. God in me, walking in me, walking in me. and you know what my job is as a believer? my job is to try to love try to love no, God has promised that he is in me and he will walk in me and what I need to do is walk according to what is in me walk according to who I am walk by means of who I am guess what that's going to produce? enmity, strife, anger, jealousy no, love, joy, peace try hard to love, no the essence of the Christian life is what? let's back up a minute it is new life right it is not what i say i believe it is not a new doctrine and i really believe it no the essence of christianity is a new life i've been changed i've been transformed i am a new creature the spirit of god is living in me the old man is dead amen let me say it this way life for me is no longer flesh life for me is no longer living in the flesh. Life for me is now God. Life for me is now spirit. Confused? That's a little vague, isn't it? Life for me is spirit. Oh, wow. I can get into that in church. Life for me is spirit. Okay. I think I can help you. I think I can help you, but you've got to keep grappling with these concepts. Let me give you another word. I gave you spirit. Life for me is in the spirit. It doesn't mean walk in. It doesn't mean walk next to it. means walk by according to what I have in me. Let me give you another word. And it'll even kind of relieve your, and I can see some of you are smoking out of the ears. You're trying to think so hard. Flesh. Let's define that word. Flesh. Walk according to the spirit and you won't carry out the desire of the flesh. What is flesh? Flesh is that which sins. It is easy. Flesh is this body, right? No, no, no. Got to be clear again. Flesh is bad and scummy. No. Who said that? Okay. Very good. Very good. Very good. You get it? Hey, flesh is bad and scummy. No, flesh makes me do bad things. It's like the devil made me do it. The flesh made me do it. In fact, the way I live my Christian life is like this. Oh, I did a bad thing. I was rooting for you, spirit. Oh, spirit, I was rooting for you, but the flesh won. Oh boy, that flesh is so strong and I have nothing to do with it. You know, I'm just out of the picture. Flesh, spirit, I'm watching them, you know. It's not that simple. It's not a little guy in a black guy and a white guy inside me going at it. No, it's more than that. And yet it's simpler than that. That's the irony of this. Let's look at the word. Let's look at the word specifically. The word is sarx. That which sins means that which sins. Man's weakness is often referred to the flesh. Romans 6.19, you're familiar with this. It speaks of the infirmity of the flesh. Okay? Romans 7.18, In my flesh dwelleth no good thing. So what is the flesh? it is weak it is infirmed it is not good it is given to sin I want you to notice something about those things though I didn't define for you what the flesh was I just told you what it did got that? important important I just told you what the flesh did I didn't tell you what it was I still don't know what it was all I know is by nature it is weak it is infirmed it is useless it is given to sin Romans 7.5 was the breakthrough for me help me come up with something I hope it helps you. Again, Wednesday we'll get together and maybe get this picture a little bit bigger. Romans 7 helped me. Paul uses the word sarx in a different way. He says this. He's speaking of a time when he didn't know Christ. And he says, When, while we were in the flesh. Something clicked. Something clicked. While we were in the flesh. He's speaking here of his unregenerate time, of his unregenerate position. In the flesh here means simply this, life apart from God. Write that down. In the flesh here, In this context, means life apart from God. It is living my life in a natural condition, right? Before I had the Spirit of God, before I became a Christian, I lived my life according to natural principles. Why was that? Because that was all I had, right? That was all I had. I didn't have the Spirit. I wasn't a supernaturally born son of God. I was just in the flesh. Therefore, life for me was God. What are you talking about? That's impossible. Life in the flesh is life in the natural Life for me is that which is in the natural realm That's all there is for me Life for me is what in the flesh What I see What do I feel What I touch What I have What I possess Picture this and get it going more in your mind Expand it Life for me in the flesh is what I see feel touch and have Therefore if life for me is in what I see feel touch and have if you threaten what I have if you threaten what I possess I will lose my life right? if you threaten who I am and you threaten my status I will lose life therefore when anything whether it be a circumstance or a person or a snow storm or a hurricane or anything threatens that which is for me life what happens? I gotta protect it there is no peace there is no patience I gotta have it why? that's life for me. If you threaten it, that is my joy as long as it is intact. That is my life. Life. And when you move on that, or nature moves on those things that are for me life, what stirs up in me is jealousy, because you have more than me, and strife, and anger, and outbursts of anger, and disputes, and dissensions, and factions, and envying, and then when I give up and say there is no reason for living. I have no reason for living. I give up drunkenness and carousing. Because when I was in the flesh, that's all there was. I live in a natural. You want to know something? An awful lot of believers live the same way. They live according to the flesh. What that means is what? Life for them is what they see and feel and touch and have. Therefore, even as a believer, if you threaten what I have and what I see and who I am and my status, what is going to stir up in me? Anger, frustration, impatience. Walk according to the Spirit. Life for me is God. Illustration. Illustration. Jesus. In the wilderness, Satan came to him and said, Jesus, turn that bread, turn that stone into a piece of bread. Turn that stone into a piece of bread. And Jesus said what? He said, No. No. I will not turn that stone into a piece of bread. I'm going to exert my will as a good Christian. I am going to exert my discipline. I heard it on Sunday morning that I need to be holy. And God even told me when I left to be holy. When you're down there, okay? So I will exert my will. And I will not turn that stone into a piece of bread. No. No, I mean it. Satan, get away from me. No. I really mean it. Really. I really do he didn't say that that even sounds stupid when I say it doesn't it he didn't say that he didn't say that you know what he said to Satan he said Satan what you need to know about me is something you obviously don't know about me and that is this life for me is not bread catching it life for me is not bread life for me is found in God and that alone and life for me is found in the spirit and life for me therefore and my meat is to do the will of the father you know what I don't even have a desire to do that. I don't even have a desire to turn that and disobey. Because life for me is not in that. And Satan, that means you've got nothing on me. You've got nothing that I want. You don't have anything to offer me that I don't already have because I believe who I am. That's walking according to the Spirit. Life for me is in God, not this. So if you take it away, I'm okay. That's freedom too. on top of the pillar. Same kind of thing. Climb up to the top of the temple and fall down and all the angels will come in and get you. Doesn't that feel attractive? Everybody will see. There's only one thing you don't understand about me, Satan. Life for me is not in that. Life for me is in God and my meat is to do the will of the one who sent me. It doesn't even attract me. It isn't about going, oh, no, no, no. You know, we would watch that thing unfold before us and we would hear Satan say to Jesus, Jesus, go up on the temple, on top of the temple, and we would see him up there and we'd go, Oh, Jesus, don't do it. Don't do it, please. Hang on, say no, we're all cheering for you. We don't need to do that because nothing was in him that wanted that, nothing. Life for him was in God. Walk according to, on the basis of, by the means of, the Spirit of God in you. When one of the things that I possess or own gets taken away, I have no peace. You know what that tells me? Life for me was that thing. And now it's gone. I have no peace. But if life for me is gone, I can let it go. Walk according to, by the means of the Spirit. To strip away all those external things that control you and begin to walk according to and by the means of just tapping that Spirit of God that you know now is in you. Maybe you didn't know it even before. You weren't aware of it. You know what you're going to enter into? Know this, a conflict. Verse 17, a conflict. Guess what? The flesh is not going to roll over for you. He won't. It won't, whatever it is. picture this see Christian and I guess I'm talking here what I have in my mind anyway are those Christians among us who have grown up in the church understand the theology of the indwelling Christ but have never really moved into it you've lived your whole life let's say according to natural principles you have the spirit but basically what's kept you in tow is the fact that every once in a while the pastor speaks a blistering sermon you feel guilty so you try harder as you begin beloved to strip away all those external things that keep you to do the right thing, the flesh is going to scream at you. It's going to scream this. It's not true. It won't work. You're going to die. If you let go of all those things that are for you life, you'll die. You will not be able to survive without that money. You won't. You will not be able to survive without that person, without his friendship. You will not be able to do it. Living according to that which is natural. the verse says in 17 for the flesh sets its desire against the spirit you know what that means? the flesh is whatever the flesh is this principle the flesh's job is to get me to live my life according to natural principles it is to get me to live my life on a natural plane it is to get me to live my life as if what is true is what I see, feel, touch, have, possess that's me that's what I have To live my life for that. Life for me is what I have. Got good news for you. That while the flesh sets its desire against the spirit, I got good news for you, believer. Even if you don't know it, even if you haven't come alive to it yet, the spirit, the spirit wages war against the flesh too. The spirit is going to be constantly prompting you, friend, John, George, Bill, whoever you are, When you begin to live your life according to natural principles, you know what he's going to bring into your life? Wonderful things like lack of peace and lack of joy and lack of love and lack of patience. Wonderful things that will tell you you are living according to the flesh. I'm going to end with this. I need to share something with you about me. I've gone through this this week. I just went through the mill with this thing this week. and some of the things I feel so strong about are because God taught me some things about this and I just want to share them with you so I don't know how structured this is going to be I just want to share with you my heart I am not a rebellious person toward the Lord I love the Lord with all my heart and I think you do too most of you here but I want to tell you something about me sometimes my mode of operation changes sometimes I do not live my life by means of the Spirit in me. And you know what? There are times when I'm aware of it. And usually when that happens, I deal with it. But there are times I'm not. And without me even knowing it, my source of life, my source of joy, my source of what makes me feel okay about who I am ceases to be Him and Him alone. And it becomes things around me and people around me. and you know when I become aware that that has happened when those things around me begin to be threatened my spirit has been troubled lack of peace I had reasons and I even hesitate to share this with you because of the potential of misunderstanding but it doesn't matter it's worth the risk to me several weeks ago we had a quarterly meeting we stepped out in faith believe in God for some things with the budget, right? Remember that? And everybody said amen. Oh, yeah, okay. And just before that, we talked about a CE director and everybody said amen. And the meeting we had down there was real unity and we thought, yeah, we're going to go for that and all of a sudden, we got this budget and it's way beyond what we can do. And there was even a sense of glory. God's going to meet our need. Guess what? It's not. Week after week after week, I'm looking at our budget. We're going even more than what we've got now and we're not even making what we've got now. And I'm going, no problem, no problem. I'm just going to pray, and I just prayed. Lord, the problem is I'm not praying enough. I'll pray more. So I pray, Lord, make it happen. Make it happen. You've led us to this. This is the thing we need to do. I'm going to pray, and I'm going to believe God. Next week, nothing. $400 less than we need now, let alone more, okay? I think you get that. Go on vacation. Last week I went on vacation, remember? Oh, I need a break. That would be so good to get away, forget all these things, leave them behind. I do that so well, don't you? I put them in a suitcase right with everything else. And I was able, it's wonderful, because you know when you're on vacation, you can look at things that get your mind off it like a tree goes by. Isn't that a beautiful tree? Right back to the problem, you know? For a few seconds here and there, you can divert your attention. Vacations are wonderful for that. But when I got back home, I unpacked my bag. There it is. I'm thinking about it all the time. Come into my office Tuesday morning, Wednesday morning. Start dealing with this text. Walk by the Spirit. I go, what does that mean? What does that mean? What does that mean? Walk by the Spirit. Not in the Spirit. Not with it. It's by the Spirit. Oh, they'll love not according to the flesh ah I know what the flesh means ah get it all these wonderful things for the flesh such as desire against the spirit ah that'll be a good one too they'll really get enough on that one but I was shaken inside beloved something was in me that was shaken inside the characteristic of my life that day was fear people around me could see it people would come in and I would have joy hi how you doing haven't seen you for a whole week inside I'm going turning I'm turning and as I was studying I went down to that 22nd verse and it said but so gentle you ever feel God's hammer on you just breaks you open and tears you up but it's like velvet at the same time I don't know how that is but it is for me but the fruit of the spirit is love joy, peace gentleness, patience not me boy not me not that day fruit of the spirit was not love you ought to give more I should never see no isn't that right I ought to give more patience I need it now you know that's my nature so I get away with it see because I'm impatient everybody knows that about Dave but you know listen I'm not even telling you to try to understand it I know in me and I think you do in you when you can go, ha ha, but it's not joy and it's not peace. And a question came to me and it came right out of the study and I just thank God for this so much. This word came right to me. It said, David, my beloved son in whom I live, what is life for you? Is life for you the financial security of that church? Of course not. Then why are you so worried? let it go it is life it is life for you seeing that church advance because maybe you'll look good of course not not that carnal and flesh then why are you so why are you being torn up inside is life for you your position is it your status is it your home and your kids as wonderful as they are certainly not then why are you so afraid then why are you so afraid could you let it go could you let it go but Lord that's life to me that's life to me then no peace sorry no joy no love what I will you will have is enmity strife jealousy outbursts of anger and you wonder where it came from disputes dissensions factions ending probably not drunkenness and carousing because you're so controlled somebody knows me they're laughing you know what happened to me this week what happens to you a lot too the flesh that which is natural set its desire on me and said David live according to what is natural live according, live your life and let your joy be dependent on what you see and what you feel and what you taste and what you touch let that be your joy I said, okay, somewhere in there I said, okay and all of a sudden when those things, at least in my mind, became threatened I lost my joy I lost my peace I lost my patience but you know what else happened to me? the spirit moved on me promise is right there. But the Spirit will wage war against the flesh too. And the Spirit moved on me. And He brought me, brought to me all the things that I find life in. And He said gently but firmly, David, what for you is life? Life for me is you. Life for me is you. Want to know the glory of that? when I come to that point? Because now probably everything else will work out anyway. Okay, maybe. But that's not the glory. The glory to me is this. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. There's nothing that anyone could take away. There's nothing that anyone could steal. Why would I hate an enemy who can't take anything from me that I don't already have from the one who is my life? but if life for you is what you see and what you feel and what you touch and what you taste and what you have the flesh there will be strife there will be hatred because every time those things are threatened you'll have to have them these Galatians stopped following their internal promptings and started living by external controls. There came conflict. I want to read for you what John read, and I'm just closing with this, I promise. And maybe even after the sermon, that text that he read will even come alive for you more. It's Galatians, I mean, Romans 8, verse 3. For what the law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, get it, what the flesh, according to natural principles, what I see, feel, taste, and touch. God did complete sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin he condemned sin in the flesh in order that the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not what? walk how? according to by the means of the flesh what I feel, taste, see and touch but according to the Spirit. My life is in you. For those who are living according to the flesh set their minds on things of the flesh, right? The things you feel, taste, touch, and have. But those who are according to the Spirit, they set their minds on things of the Spirit. My life is in you. Nothing else can threaten me. For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and what? Peace. and the fruit of the spirit is what? Love, joy, peace. Do you get it? Let me ask you a question. What for you is life? This morning, what for you is life? Some of you are here so troubled and so hurt because something that is for you is life is being threatened. If that is life for you, I can't give you no peace. life for me is you you know what I think this morning I think some of you need to spend some time and let the spirit continue to talk to you about this and let go of that thing that is for you life maybe the Lord has exposed to you something that like me had taken the place of the spirit and I'm just going to open open invitation if you need to come you come and you can just sit here and pray and someone will talk to you you don't need to come though maybe some of you just need to sit where you are and talk to a friend or just be alone with the Lord maybe it's fine just to leave you don't have to do anything I just want you to know that you can spend some time with the Lord in response to this I hope it helps but I say walk according to the spirit and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh in fact Lord my sense is that this has been potent and I thank you for the things you've taught me this last week. But a sermon on the walk of the Spirit doesn't make us walk. Something needs to yield inside of us. That's what I mean when I say do your work among us. Let that hammer come down with his velvet touch of love and break us open to you. In Jesus' name, amen. Thank you.
