I'd like to pray. And this I pray, that utterance may be given me in the opening of my mouth, that I might make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, the mystery of your cross, and the power of your resurrection. Fill my body with strength from you, and fill my mouth with truth. from you that even would give us a thimble full of the taste of your life. That would be more than we could bear. For it is so alive. I pray your spirit's work be potent through your word in Jesus' name. Amen. An often overlooked but exceedingly powerful resurrection passage of Scripture is found in Ephesians chapter 4, verses 9 and 10. I'd like you to open your Bibles to that passage right now, Ephesians chapter 4, verses 9 and 10, where it says, among other things, this, that he who descended also ascended. Descended speaks generally of his death. Ascended speaks generally of his resurrection. Specifically, the text says this. Now this expression, he ascended, what does it mean? Except that he also had descended into the lower parts of the earth. And he who descended is himself also the one who ascended far above all the heavens that he might fill all things. We are here today, this Easter Sunday morning, to celebrate the fact that he who descended did indeed ascend. That he who died did indeed rise again. But before we, at least as it relates to our study, do the celebration around the resurrection, I want to examine something that I find very intriguing and indeed somewhat troubling. It's found in the middle of verse 9 of Ephesians chapter 4, where it says that he who descended, he who ascended, also descended into the lower parts of the earth. The lower parts of the earth. Not physically the core of the earth itself physically, but whenever in the Word of God you see a reference to the lower parts of the earth, it is a reference to Hades. it is specifically a reference to a real place, hell. Seeming, therefore, to indicate that after Jesus' death, which we spoke about on Good Friday, and before his resurrection, which is why we're here today, Jesus, in that gap between that nobody talks too much about, descended into hell. Jesus went to hell. Did you know that? does it bother you even to say those words jesus went to hell there's something about that that feels kind of wrong well if it's true then my question would be this what did he do there why did he go there we've got to do what's called a theological construction here there's no one passage of scripture where we can really dig in and pull out all the information a construction is that you kind of pull bits and pieces together and put together a picture of what happened. Part of the construction would therefore have to include 1 Peter 3.19, where it answers the question about what Jesus did in hell, at least in part, where it says this, he made proclamation to the spirits now in prison. That when he descended, he made proclamation to the spirits now in prison. Now some believe that that is kind of the cosmic equivalent of a Billy Graham crusade in hell. It was a weekend deal. Started Friday night, went all day Saturday, ended up Sunday morning. Could have been. Kind of a thing, giving the demons one more chance to hear the truth and respond in faith. Some people believe that and teach that, and that's okay. I don't subscribe to that. Indeed, the Greek word for proclamation is not euangelizo, which is what I think the word would have been if it would have been that kind of dynamic. Euangelizo, good newsing, telling them the gospel that they could respond to then. The Greek word for proclamation is keruso, which means to proclaim or to make a statement of fact. More accurate, I believe the picture is this, that at the end of his time in hell, in the lower parts of the earth, just prior to the resurrection, in fact, one way to see it is that the first event of the resurrection event, after that weekend, if you will, in hell, the first event of the resurrection was his making proclamation. Now his proclamation was something that physically we did not see. The people in Jesus' day didn't know that that took place. We get it later by inspiration of the Spirit. The first thing physically men and women were able to see was the ground quaking, the stone turning away, and Jesus coming out alive. But just before that, I believe, Jesus rose up in the lower parts of the earth, in hell, and made a proclamation. The proclamation was to Satan and all the demons of hell, And it was fundamentally this. Satan, here's the deal. What you meant for evil, God meant for good. What you supposed was your greatest victory is, in fact, your ultimate defeat. I win, you'll lose, bye-bye. And he blew open the gates of hell. He who descended also ascended, and he took his place at the right hand of the Father, from which he now reigns. He therefore then sent his spirit into the lives of men and women like you and me, transforming us into the very likeness of his Son, gives gifts to the church and is alive forevermore. That's what happened. But all of that raises a question. It's this. What happened in hell the rest of the time? If this proclamation kind of came right at the beginning of the resurrection event, at the end of his time in hell, what happened the rest of the time? The answer, I believe, can be found at least in part in Hebrews 2, verse 9, where it says that Jesus tasted death for every man. I believe that what Jesus was doing when he descended into hell was in hell tasting death for every man. Wait a minute. Some of you might say, I thought that Jesus tasted death for every man on the cross. And when he died, he was done tasting death. In fact, one of the things he said was, it is finished. So that's when he was done. Well, I'm going to answer some of the deals around that in a few minutes. But I want you to think for a minute. On the cross, as Jesus was physically suffering, there is a way in which he tasted death, to be sure. but mostly what he tasted on the cross was not death, but the process of death. And for him, it was a terrible process, but what he tasted was the process. It was not until he died, it was not until he breathed his last, that he actually tasted the grip of, went into the string, the stronghold of what death really is. And he tasted death, not just the process, but he tasted the death, he felt it for three days, at least from Friday night to Sunday morning. Hmm. Now, to really capture the scope of this death that I think he tasted, I want you to come back with me to Mark chapter 14 and Luke chapter 22. It is a scene that most of you are fairly familiar with. It is Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. Prior to the cross event, he is preparing himself for the agony ahead. And he's speaking these words, first to the disciples and then to the Father. To the disciples he says this, My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Remain here and keep watch. Then he went a little beyond his disciples, fell to the ground and began to pray that if it were possible this cup might pass him by, saying, Abba, Father, all things are possible for thee. Remove this cup from me, yet not my will, but thine be done. Remove this cup. Luke chapter 22, verse 43 then records that an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. Why? Here's why. Because the answer from the Father was, No, son, there is no other way but to drink all that is in the cup. And having received that answer, being in agony, he continued to pray fervently. And his sweat became like drops of blood falling down upon the ground. Here's my question. What was in that cup? The anticipation of which could cause agony like that. What was Jesus, by drinking this cup, about to taste? Well, part of the answer to that question is obvious. We focused on it Friday. In the physical arena, it's what we can see, the physical arena, revealing to us the suffering of Christ as he is physically dying on the cross. And when I think about agony and anticipated pain, the cross would be enough for me to move into the agony of Gethsemane. I would just begin to think about it and I would be in agony. So it explains it. Historians tell us that there are few more painful ways to die than by crucifixion. The piercing of the hands and feet with large nails makes contact with all the great nerve centers of the body. And even though the pain is excruciating, the bleeding is relatively light, which ensures a long process of death. Some people hanging on a cross literally for days. The ultimate cause of death in a crucifixion, interestingly, is suffocation, which is why to get the bodies off of the cross before the Passover, The Jews told the Romans, and they complied, to break the legs of those who on the cross were still alive. And if you break the legs, you can't push up anymore, relieving, therefore, the pressure on the lungs. They broke the legs. They couldn't push up. They suffocated quickly. Jesus, as you know, did not have his legs broken. He died more quickly, most believe, because he had been so savagely beaten before his crucifixion. Certainly, the anticipation of that kind of physical suffering would explain the agony in the garden. Certainly that physical agony of the cross was what was in the cup that he didn't want to drink, that he was about to taste. And yes, that was in the cup, but please just know this, that there was more. Indeed, there was much more in the cup. We can see and relate to the physical suffering on the cross. Jesus knew that it included the cross, but it was infinitely more than the cross. Indeed, I believe so much more than the physical pain of the cross that right now I believe that his physical suffering could well be seen as but a picture of his real suffering. What are you talking about? Consider now past his physical pain on the cross, which is what he anticipated and didn't want to have to drink. Consider now the suffering of his spirit, The suffering of his soul, if you will. And as you do, know this, that the suffering of his soul that I think he knew about was what was in the cup. Was the death he was about to taste for every man. To get the fullness of this picture, I'd like you to understand it this way. Picture Jesus on the cross. And as his physical body is dying, know this. that unseen by physical eyes, a terrible, wonderful transaction is taking place in the realm of the spirits. It is this. As his physical body is running out of gas, as it were, and it's going down, at the same time, something is escalating, and that is this. More and more and more, the sin of the world is coming upon him. Much like on the Passover celebration, the high priest would take the lamb, the spotless lamb, and put on the Lamb's head all the sin of Israel and then offer it up. In that same way, the spotless Lamb of God in His dying, while He was physically dying, was having all the sin of the world come upon Him even as He died. The sin of the world staining, as it were, His very soul. Think about that. Not just coming on His physical body, but it was staining His very soul. At this point, as you see His body dying and sin coming on Him, though his body is dying, know this, his spirit is very much alive, just the way your spirit will be very much alive the day you die. And as his body is dying, he is in the process of literally becoming sin. Where do you get that? 2 Corinthians 5.21. He who knew no sin literally became sin. Sin did not just come upon him. He literally became the essence of sin, the embodiment of sin. Romans 8.3 says it this way, He took on the form of sinful flesh. When did He take that on? On the cross, He began to take that on. Galatians 3.13, He became, while dying, a curse for us. 1 Peter 2.24 maybe says it best. He Himself began to bear our sin in His body, in His spirit, on the tree. as he was dying. Think about this just for a second. It'll help a little bit to get the full picture. Think about it in human terms. This sin is coming upon his soul at the worst possible time. Just don't make him Jesus. Make him men. Let it be you. Sin is coming on his soul at his most vulnerable, weakest moment. In human terms, It would be as if you were hanging on a cross, dying, unable to then do anything about a sin-stained soul. There's no time to say you're sorry. Jesus, if he has sin on him, is receiving the guilt of sin. There's no time to repent. There's no time to make it right. There's some Catholic theology. Catholics speak of not dying with a mortal sin on your soul. and if you die with a mortal sin on your soul, and so they're always making sure there's no mortal sins. I'm not espousing Catholic theology there. I'm just giving you a picture. That's the worst way to die, with a sin unforgiven on your soul. This sin is coming on him at the worst possible time while he's dying. As the sin is coming on and he's dying, the closer he gets to death, the less likely it's going to be, in human terms, that he's going to be able to do anything about this sin. You get it? You don't want to die this way. I mean I don't want to die on a cross and I've always thought that the worst thing about his death was his crucifixion, it's the worst way a man can die there's a worse way that you can die than on a cross the worst way you can die is to have the sin of the world on you and not forgiven picture it he is dying the worst possible way for he is dying with unforgiven sin and staining his soul. He became sin. Now picture him breathing his last. And when he died, Isaiah 44, Psalm 63, 1 Peter 4.19 and Ephesians 4.9 all indicates that with the sin of the world staining his soul, he descends into hell. That's not a place I want to go with sin on me. I want to die having been covered with the blood of God. I want to die having been forgiven. Hell then has no access to me. Jesus died with the sin of the world on him, descends into hell, where because of the sin of the world on him, hell now has what it thinks is legal access to do to Jesus what hell does to sin. Beloved, we can't get the picture, just get the teaching, all of hell's fury. everything that you and I would experience in death, were it not for amazing grace, Jesus begins to experience completely all of yours throughout eternity, men and women's sin, begins to experience the torment of punishment for sin. And that, beloved, was the death he tasted for every man. And that's what it meant when it says Jesus paid the price for our sin. On the tree, the tree is a picture of the real suffering that began when he tasted death. You know, having grown up in church, I've heard these phrases all my life, even phrases I'm using here this morning. He tasted death for every man. He paid the price I couldn't pay. He died a death I couldn't die. We sang a song often and we'd hear it at Easter. It should have been me. It should have been me. And as a kid, I'd hear that. And as a kid, you take it very literally. And part of my gratitude was born of the fact that it should have been me. but what I literally thought was this, that if Jesus hadn't died on a cross 2,000 years ago, then I probably would have been nailed to a cross. I mean, I just kind of figured there'd be a bunch of crosses around and everybody would get nailed to one. And I was so grateful. I would sit there at nine years old. I'd sit in the service and I'd stick my thumb in there. And I'd go, oh, that hurts so bad. I'm really glad it was you, not me. Thanks. You know, if that's as far as you can go, it still stirs up gratitude in an eight-year-old heart. And I'm thinking, God, you took my place and I'm grateful. But now I'm getting, with some adult understanding, and I'm starting to get a picture. The price he paid for sin was infinitely more. It was infinitely more than a rather short period of physical torment, which was terrible. We see here, he died a death I couldn't die. And I'm so grateful. And I was convinced, I couldn't have done that cross. And well, yes, you could. Yes, you could. They might have to chase you and tie you and grab you and tie you to the cross. But I promise you, if they got nailed to a cross, you could die on it. The death he died, I couldn't die, was not just on the cross. The death he died that I couldn't ever die was to go into death's grip and then come out alive. The price he paid in hell was a price that if I paid, I'd pay it forever and ever and ever and ever and ever. her. So I might ask a question. It's a good question at this point. What about this thing you mentioned a bit ago when Jesus said, it is finished? Those were his last words. I thought it was finished. Well, my question about that question is this. What was finished? What was finished? I mean, it's clear that when he hung on the cross and said, it is finished, that the resurrection hadn't happened yet. And so that wasn't finished. And without the resurrection, his death is meaningless. It has no power whatsoever. He has not yet, when he says on the cross it is finished, he has not yet descended. He's about to descend. He has not yet ascended, both of which are things Ephesians 4 says he does and part of the redemptive act. So when he says it is finished, my question is, what was finished? I believe the answer to that is this, that what was finished was this, the necessary physical sacrifice of the spotless Lamb of God that once completed, picture that, that when He breathes His last and He enters into the grip of death, that that place will set into motion events in the spirit realm that now that He has finally died cannot be reversed. We've passed the point of no return. It is finished means I am now crossing the threshold. There is no turning back until the moment of his death. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the earth and set him free. Here's the good news. He didn't do that. Instead, having become sin, as he is dying, the sin of the world comes on him. He breathes his last feature this. The Father turns his back. Jesus, with the sin of the world on him, descends into the lower parts of the earth and there tastes death for every man. There pays the price for sin in hell. Think about this. Well, all of us fear the process of death. I don't want to suffer when I get this fantasy. I'm going to die in my sleep and just wake up and go, hey, I'm here. So I want to go. And none of us wants to have pain and when we think about it, you know, kind of in a temporal way, the biggest fear we have about death is how. The eternal question and fear about death is not the method we're going to die. It's after. What's going to happen to me when I die? Beloved, the grip of death begins and the strength of death is felt when you die. Your process may be horrible, but you have not felt death until you die. Nobody here can talk about what death feels like unless you've been in its grip. And the only way to be in its grip is to die. Therefore, to break the grip of death requires more than experiencing the process of death. You've got to go into death to break the grip of death. And Jesus experienced that. He tasted that. Jesus did not just experience the process of dying. He experienced the grip of death, the fury of hell. He descended into the lower parts and there tasted death for every man but. And now I get to the good part. Now I'm ready for Easter. Here's the good news. The good news is this, that he who descended also ascended. He broke the power of sin and death. He blew open the gates of hell. He ascended to the Father, saying essentially this, Father, mission accomplished. He sent His Spirit to live in and transform the lives of men and women like you and like me. And He loves His bride. And when I saw Him, John said in Revelation 1, verse 18, He said this, I fell at His feet as a dead man. And He laid His right hand upon me, saying, John, don't be afraid. I am the first. I am the last. I am the Alpha and the Omega. I am the beginning and the end. I am John. I am the living one. For behold, I was dead. But behold, I am alive forevermore. And I have in my hand the keys of death and hell. And you know where I got them? I got them in hell. You know how I got them? I took them. I took them. And now I unlock the power of hell so people can be free. doesn't that make you want to sing doesn't make you want to worship well we're gonna we're gonna worship team i want you to come i got a few more things to say don't get too excited yet but i want the worship team to come as we pull this thing together and release our hearts to worship here's how it happened here's how the tables got turned in hell this christ the spotless lamb of God who bore our sin in his body was in fact an innocent. Yes, he became sin, but the fact was this sin was coming upon the spotless lamb of God. And because he was the spotless lamb, God could go to work on his behalf. And go to work, God did. For while Satan had a party with Jesus from Friday night to Sunday morning, his party was illegal. Everything venomous that he threw at Jesus was off his ground. He had no legal right to do it, for Jesus was the spotless lamb. And in the court of heaven, Jesus was judged as an innocent. The tables are turned, and God goes to war. Acts chapter 2, verse 24, records that war won this way. Then God raised him up again, putting an end to the agony of his death, since it was impossible for Jesus to be held in its power. He was held in its power for three days. The grip of death, the fury of hell, from Friday night to Sunday morning. But he was an innocent. It's as if God, beloved, showed up in hell. And with the blood of Jesus dripping off the hands of demons, God said to those demons, You have no right to do this. You have no authority, for that is the spotless Lamb of God that you have dealt with. God then made the blood that they so enjoyed spilling, the cleansing blood, and he who descended ascended. And as he ascended, he made a proclamation. The proclamation was this, to Satan and all the demons of hell, what you meant for evil, God meant for good. What you suppose was your greatest victory is your ultimate defeat. I hope you enjoyed yourself, because here is the eternal deal. I win, you'll lose, bye-bye. And he blew open the gates of hell. Hell could not keep him. All the resources of the underworld, including the grip of death itself, could not hold him. Psalm 107, 16 says that he broke the gates of brass, he cut the bars of iron asunder, and then he said with a loud voice to John, and now to you and to me, I am the Alpha and Omega. I am the beginning and I am the first and the last. I am the living one. For I was dead, but behold, I am alive forevermore. And I hold in my hands the keys of death and hell so you can be free. It's time to worship Him.
