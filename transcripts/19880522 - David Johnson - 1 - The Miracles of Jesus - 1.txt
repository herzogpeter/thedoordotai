Why don't you open your Bibles with me to the book of Matthew, chapter 8, verse 1. I think you're aware of the fact, if you've been with us any time at all, that we are entering now a new section. The section is going to be entitled, The Miracles of Jesus, or the Healing Ministry of Christ. The section is going to go from chapter 8 through chapter 9. It is significant that immediately following the Sermon on the Mount, what most scholars believe is on the same day, these miracles begin to flow, And we'll see that significance in these next few weeks. But hanging on to the context, the sermon had just begun. It's the very same day, chapter 8, verse 1. And when he had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. And behold, a leper came to him and bowed down to him, saying, Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean. And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, I am willing. Be cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. And Jesus said to him, See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest, and present the offering that Moses commanded for a testimony to them. That's as far as we're going to get today. Let's pray. Father, I believe that the picture you paint for us here relative to who you are and what you do and what your kingdom is about and what redemptive healing is even about is absolutely profound. And Father, in the flesh there is no power or authority to communicate the wonder of it. And I ask in Jesus' name for the work of your Spirit to be released in this time of our service. That by a work of miraculous grace and miraculous moving of your Spirit, we would have ears to hear. And that, Father, by a working of miraculous grace and miraculous moving of your Spirit, I would have the energy and the words to communicate your precious word. I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. Anytime we come into a new section, one of the things that I know I need to do is do some teaching. In order for us to make the applications that are necessary for the next several weeks and see how they flow and see the real significance, a foundation of teaching has to be laid. There are some general things you need to know. In fact, I would encourage you, I don't know if you take notes or not, but I would encourage you to do that, especially with these introductory remarks. Hang on to the notes and bring them back with you every Sunday as we see the flow of these things going on. The first thing I want you to know and just file in your mind as we go through these next few weeks is this. In chapter 8 and 9, there are nine miracles in all. Jesus did many miracles. The fact that Matthew chose nine is very significant. He chose them specifically for a purpose to communicate certain things. Not only are there nine, but they're even structured in a way that is significant and brings meaning to us in terms of understanding. They are sectioned in three miracles of three sections. In other words, there's three miracles and then there's going to be a response. And then there's going to be three more miracles and then another response. And then three more miracles and then another response. Not only that, it's significant the kind of miracles they are. The first three miracles are going to be expressions of the fact that the God of heaven, who came to earth and his name is Jesus, has authority on earth to heal physical things. The first three miracles are physical. And that's a statement about what God does, the arena in which he operates. And it's a message about the kingdom of God. God heals and cares about physical things. The second section of miracles goes past physical things to spiritual things and spiritual needs. It is going to demonstrate the fact that God has on earth authority to forgive sins. And not only that, but He has authority over the demons of darkness. And we are going to see God, Jesus, come to people who are afflicted with the bondage of demonic influence and presence. And in the name of God, in the power of the kingdom, bring them release. And in the third set of miracles, we are going to see God having authority, Jesus, God incarnate on earth, having authority on this earth over the ultimate enemy of man, and that is death. As we see people raised from the dead, and there will be powerful spiritual significance in that as we go through that, speaking of God's eternal healing, raising people from the dead. In each case, Jesus is going to be establishing himself as Lord and God. He has authority in every area. He has authority over disease. He has authority over demons, and He has authority over death itself. I want you to file that and know that. It's important for us in terms of teaching. There's another thing I want you to file in your mind, and it's important that you have a certain attitude as we come into this text. I want you to know that I am not going to use this text as a proof text for how we should do healing. This is not a time to use this as a healing model. The reason is this. I don't want to get ahead of Matthew. I would like to think that one of the things you come away with, week after week, is a sense of balance in the teaching of the Word of God. One of the reasons it's balanced, I trust, is because we let the text talk and don't try to say things that aren't there yet. I think it's very important at the very beginning, as we begin to consider the ministry of Jesus as it relates to healing, that we find ourselves somehow in the very same multitude that Jesus is describing, or Matthew is describing in chapter 8, verse 1. And when it came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him. You need to see yourself and I need to see myself as these miracles unfold as part of the multitude. What I mean by that is this. All we are doing as part of the multitude is watching what Jesus did. We're not doing anything. We're not being called to heal. We're not being called to start a healing ministry in our church. None of that is there yet. We are there to watch. We are there to see. We are there to learn from God what Jesus is doing and who He really is. And I think if we're going to really get what is being intended here by Matthew, we need to find ourselves in that posture. I just want to see Jesus do stuff here. I just want to sit in my chair and watch Jesus do what he did. And some of the things you're going to feel stirred in your spirit is a new love for Jesus. You're going to see him in his majesty and his power and his authority on earth to move and change things. And it's going to build your faith. I really believe that's going to be one of the residual aspects of this teaching. I also get chills, however, when I realize that while I'm telling you to sit in a posture of not doing anything and not thinking about a healing ministry or anything like that and just watch, I also get chills when I realize that in chapter 10, following chapter 9, after we just sit and watch what Jesus did, He is going to look at those disciples and say these incomparable, incomprehensible kinds of things like this, As the Father has sent me, after you've seen me do these things, so send I you. And all authority has been given unto me, disciples, and I give that authority to you, and the things you've seen and heard from me, I want you to do. I want you to do these things, and I have a feeling their mouth just dropped open. But wait on that. It's important that we wait on that. We're part of the multitude. We're just watching. There's another thing I want us to understand and note at the very beginning, that there are messages in these miracles. And one of the things that I want you to know about what I'm doing with these is I'm going to continually be looking for the messages in the miracles. I told you just a moment ago that Jesus did many miracles. In chapter 20 of the Gospel of John, verse 30, John is concluding his Gospel and he is saying that there were many signs and many wonders and many demonstrations of the power of God through Jesus. But they were not all written in the book. There were certain ones chosen. And the reason Matthew chose the ones he did was not even to just say Jesus did miracles. The miracles that he chose all had a message. There were things that were revealed in the miracles. There were things that were taught in the miracles about who Jesus was, about what He was calling us to, all sorts of messages that we need to hear. Let me give you some examples and write these down. And these are basically the ones I want you to bring every week. One of the things we're going to see is the message from the miracle. The message in the miracle is one of the messages in the miracle is this, that Jesus Christ is God. That's one of them. Jesus Christ is God Himself. How do you know? Because the things that Jesus did and does in these next two chapters, Only God could do. That's one of the messages in the miracle, and we need to keep hearing it. Every miracle we see, we need to hear a message, Jesus is God. Jesus is God. He is our King. He is our Lord. He is able. He has authority. And stirring up faith and love for Him. One of the things you need to note, even in terms of the flow of this, I told you a moment ago as well, that this is following right on the Sermon on the Mount. And the result of the Sermon on the Mount, when He spoke, was this. That they were amazed at His teaching. Remember that? Verse 28, chapter 7. For he was teaching them as one having authority and not as their scribes. He spoke as one having authority. In fact, you remember from the Sermon on the Mount that he turned the whole religious system upside down. There was one point of the Sermon on the Mount where he had the gall to come to them and say this. You have heard it said from your rabbis and from your scribes. You have had certain kinds of teaching. But I say to you a different message. What gall he had. By what authority do you speak, Jesus? And in chapter 8 and chapter 9, the authority by which he speaks is going to be put on display. It is by the authority of Almighty God that I speak. And I'm going to demonstrate that by the power of God and doing things that only God can do. There is a message in the miracles we need to constantly hear. Jesus is God. He is the Lord. He is our King. There's another message in the miracle you need to hear. And that is this, that Jesus, who is God and He is our King and He is our Lord, has a heart to move to every area of human need. It is significant. It is not a random choice that the first miracles that Matthew records were healing miracles of physical things. That is not just by chance. That is by design. There's a message in there, and that is this. God cares about physical things. He moves to people at their place of human need. He moves past that. He starts with the mundane, the physical. He moves to the spiritual and sets hearts free and breaks the bondage of Satan. And ultimately, his power moves even past physical and spiritual into the eternal work of raising people from the dead forever. Hallelujah. That's an incredible message. What a flow. There's another message in the miracle that I want you to be bringing with you as we talk about these things. And that is this. He is always moving, consistently moving, to the lowest level of human dignity when he ministers because those are consistently the people who are open to his grace and to his power. Again, it is not a random choice of miracles. It is significant that the very first person he heals is a leper, a social outcast. We will see the significance of that as the teaching emerges. The second person he healed was a Roman centurion. So what's so bad about that? A Roman centurion, first of all, was a Roman soldier. That means the Jews hated him. Not only was he a Roman soldier, but he was a Gentile. Not only from some study I did this last week on the centurion, we're not getting to that, but I understood this last week that not only was he a Gentile, but he was a Samaritan. He was despised. Jesus ministered there. The third person he ministered to was a woman. In that culture, women were having no status whatsoever. In many ways, the same problem still exists. Jesus came to that level and ministered there. Again, it was part of it. It's turning everything upside down. I am not going to operate the way you think, religious people. I am not going to minister. My kingdom is not what you think. It's going to be to lepers. It's going to be to Samaritans. It's going to be to women, the people you won't even eat with. I'm going to build my kingdom there. The message is the power of God is always released. By the way, in the Beatitudes, we were talking about how you enter the kingdom. Remember? Let me tie this even in with it. There's so many things. I'm not going to apologize. I almost did. Louis. So many things I am going to give you today. You just hang with me because it's worth it. It'll be worth it. The very beginning of the Beatitudes. You remember what happened? He came and he declared the kingdom of heaven was at hand. Remember? And then he demonstrated that kingdom was a kingdom of power and authority. And he healed the sick and he cast out demons. And the multitudes came and all the crowd was there. And he knew that they were coming for all the wrong reasons. So he said, wait a minute. And he began to talk about how you enter the kingdom. You enter broken and mourning and hungering and thirsting for God. And they're the only ones. And these pious, religious, good-looking Pharisees are on their way straight to hell. It is the broken, the mourning, the hungry, the lepers. That was how you enter. And now he's back to the power. Do you see that? He's back to the power. The power is going to be released too. Among the broken and the mourning. The lepers, the Samaritans, the people you wouldn't expect. Even a small thing. I want you to know this as we go in. One of the messages in the miracles is this, that the heart of Jesus responds to human suffering and pain. Do you like that? I like that. You're going to hear that gently through every one of these miracles. When he saw human pain and suffering, he moved there. That's where he moved. He didn't go away. He went toward that. Some of you are hurting today. You need to hear that that's where Jesus moves. That's good news. Another thing we're going to hear these next weeks is this, that he blesses faith wherever he finds it. He blesses faith wherever he finds it. In the leper, I believe you can make me clean. In the Samaritan centurion, you just say the word. I believe that you can do it. He blesses faith wherever he can find it, but there's another message right underneath that that we're going to hear all through this, and that is this. Not only does he bless faith wherever he can find it, but he finds it in the strangest places. You see, he said to the centurion, and I'm getting ahead, but I couldn't wait to tell you this. he marveled verse 10 of chapter 8 at this guy's faith when Jesus heard this he marveled and said to those following truly I say to you I have not found such great faith with anyone in Israel one thing what kind of faith would it take to cause Jesus to marvel the other thing is this I looked in Israel for that faith I looked among religious people for that faith I looked where I ought to be able to find faith in temples made with stone but I never found it there I found it in the craziest places I found that among lepers and Samaritans, people those Pharisees wouldn't even eat dinner with. Those are the messages and the miracles, and we're going to hear them flowing through every one of them. Let's get to the miracle, okay? Verses 1 through 4. Really, starting in verse 4, verse 1 just brings him down from the mountain with the multitudes following. I want to break the text into two parts. Simply this, the coming of the leper to Jesus, and then the second part is the response of Jesus. We're going to take it just a phrase at a time. and behold the leper came to him and behold the leper came to him that word behold is significant that's a bible word that's what you say I don't know you just say that word I guess the word is significant to put it in the vernacular it would go like this if we were saying that we would not go behold a leper came we would go holy cat you'll never believe it a leper came behold that's what behold means in the Greek says right in Kittle. Holy cats! That's what behold means. Everybody was shocked this guy's coming. And the word come is even significant. I must be really scratching for material today. He's going to do a sermon on the word come. He came. It does. It is significant. It means he actively approached. He came straight away. He came direct. So what? Well, I'll tell you, that is a big so what because I know some things about lepers that I haven't shared with you. The fact that he came to Jesus through the crowd is incredibly significant because lepers don't do that. Let me tell you why. First of all, I want to just give you a little background on disease in general and then leprosy specifically, and you'll understand why behold is a big deal that he came. The background of disease in the land of Israel when Jesus was there basically is this. Medicine at that time was, as we know it, non-existent. When someone in those days would get afflicted with a disease that you or I would go to a doctor for, maybe suffer two or three days or a week with, in those days, almost always, a disease like that would be fatal. The only cure they knew was for the disease to run its course, hopefully it would run its course and not kill me. Plagues ran rampant through that culture. This might sound silly to you, but I was doing some reading lately, and they were talking about the population explosion. And one of the reasons the population is exploding is because of the medicine we've got. It keeps people alive. Thank God for that. I mean, I don't want to sound like a negative thing, but one of the things that kept thinning things, the plagues and pestilence and people died all the time. One of the greatest needs of mankind at that time was disease. Well, it is today too. Not near now like it was then. Scripture reveals some of the diseases that brought fatal results. Atrophy was common. Atrophy was what we would call muscular dystrophy or polio. we still don't have a cure for muscular dystrophy blindness caused by gonorrhea and syphilis even at that time babies were born blind it was rampant we have medicines for that now boils, deafness, dropsy which is edema, retention of body fluids no way to treat that dysentery ran rampant again I talked about pestilence and plagues that were carried from town to town by mice and rats bleeding that they didn't know how to stop tumors, ulcers and then the three in our text were leprosy, paralysis and then a fever with Peter-in-law's mother. In all of those diseases, every disease that ever came down the pike it generated a tremendous amount of fear. And it is again significant that Jesus, the first ministry he had with them relative to his hands-on ministry was meeting them at the point of their greatest need. But of all the diseases that ran rampant in those days leprosy was the most feared. and let me tell you why. Number one, physically. It did several things. Leprosy physically attacked the nervous system of the body and what that ultimately did was it anesthetized the nerve endings. For instance, we see very often people who have leprosy and their noses are falling off of their ears and their fingers are all stubbly and one of the things that I learned through this and I've even heard this before is that one reason that sometimes the fingers fall off is because they've lost the sensation because the nerve endings have died and they literally rub them off without knowing they're doing it. Same with the nose, the ears, and other appendages on the body. But that's not the only thing leprosy does. It not only attacks the central nervous system, it attacks the bone marrow and the blood of a person. So that with the bone marrow being attacked, bones would inside the body begin to shrivel up. When the bones of your fingers begin to shrivel up, it draws the skin and the tissue in so that the fingers and the toes would begin to look like claws. On top of that, the manifestations of the disease were oozing sores, losing all of your teeth, going blind, It was contagious, which was another manifestation of the disease that brought with it tremendous amounts of stigma. And also, it was absolutely, totally incurable. There was no cure for it, save a touch from God. Socially, those were the physical manifestations. Socially, anyone with leprosy was an outcast. You can already tell why. They don't look very good. Nobody wants to be around a leper. Invite him to a party. Dr. Hoisinga describes these things. the disease generally begins with pain followed by numbness soon the skin loses its original color it turns thick, glossy and scaly as the sickness progresses they become dirty sores and ulcers due to the poor blood supply the skin around the eyes and the ears begins to bunch with deep furrows creating the look of a lion in the face fingers begin to drop off or are absorbed back into the skin toes, eyebrows and eyelashes do the same all of the human senses are affected and repulsed by leprosy. First of all, you can see leprosy. When you see it, you're repulsed. It's ugly. The second thing is you can touch leprosy. There is a distinctive touch. If you were blind and you touched a leper, you could tell that they were a leper simply by the feeling of their skin. Not only can you see it and touch it, you can smell it. It emits a foul odor, so you would know you were in the presence of a leper just by smelling. Not only do you see it, touch it, and smell it, but you can hear it. Why? Because the disease also affects the larynx of the person and they begin to have a voice that sounds like grating things. And raspy. So whenever they speak, you can spot it right now. And not only that, Dr. Hoisinga goes on to say that if you spend any time with lepers, pretty soon you'll begin to get a taste in your own mouth of the smell you're smelling. The bottom line on all of that is this. It is socially disgusting. We don't want anything to do with these people. But there's another aspect of the leprosy that affected people that made it worse than the physical or the social, and that was the spiritual. You see, in the land of Israel, God ordained, and I don't even understand, well, I do understand why, but it sounds mean. But the point is this, that God ordained that leprosy would be ceremonially unclean. If you had leprosy, you were deemed to be ceremonially unclean. That means sin. Why? Let me explain. The reason a leper was declared ceremonially unclean is because it was the best physical illustration that God had of what sin looked like to him. Leprosy, like sin, is disgusting. Sin, like leprosy, is ugly. It is repulsive. It alienates us from God, and it alienates us from people. They don't want to be around us. Sin is incurable, save a supernatural touch from God, and it's contagious, it spreads. So in the mind of a Jew when he saw a leper, he saw not only a disgusting disease in the mind of a Jew, he saw a disgusting person. They not only feared lepers, they hated them. They connected them with sin. A disease that I think we could compare it with in our culture would be AIDS. Not only is it a fearful and what we would call disgusting disease, many of us respond to people who have AIDS the same way the Jews of that day would respond to a leper. It is a disgusting sin thing. Now I begin to get a little glimpse of what was going on when they said, Behold, a person with AIDS came to church and all God's people said, Hallelujah! No? Well, if the answer is no, and you even got problems, I can't even believe he's comparing this to AIDS. AIDS is homosexual. Then you know exactly how, now you're in the multitude. Now you're in the multitude. You know exactly how they felt about the leper. He's got a disease, he deserves it. Okay, fine. Now you're in the multitude, you know how they felt. That's exactly how they felt. Four things we need to see about the leper's approach. He bowed down and said to him, Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean. The first thing that I think is significant about the leper's approach to Jesus is this. He was absolutely desperate. He was absolutely desperate. And there's kingdom truth in there. Somewhere along the line, he quit caring what people thought. He quit caring what people said. He quit caring what people did. And he said, I am going to go to him. I need help. I give a rip what anybody else thinks. It's called, in my mind, pressing your way into the kingdom. Remember when we talked about that? It's the narrow way, and you're going to have to press your way into the kingdom. and you're going to have to forget about what people think, and you're going to have to quit caring what they say, and quit caring what they do. And this guy was a social outcast, and he was going to have people kill him. I mean, rabbis used to talk about a leper who came within five feet of you could in some instances be worthy of death. If they come near you, they're dead. On a windy day, they weren't allowed to be within 150 feet of someone. For him to come through that crowd, something broke inside of him. I don't care what they say. I don't care what they do. I don't care if they kill me. I'm going to go be by him. The timeless truth in this picture as we begin in terms of how he came was that people who really come into the life and the reality and the power of the kingdom, the people who really begin to experience the power of the kingdom are the ones who are so aware of their desperate need for Jesus that what people think and what they say and what they do does not matter anymore. And that is true coming into the kingdom, But if you ever want to experience the power of the kingdom, that continual breaking is going to have to happen. You are going to have to, in your kingdom walk, continually forget about and not give a rip about what religious people in this church even think or say or do to you. Come desperate. God, if you don't move, we can't go. I remember a couple of months ago, I was really discouraged. And I was listening to a tape of a friend of mine. Dave Busby, who was talking about one of his favorite themes, the manifest presence of God, and how desperate he wanted to experience that in his church and in his ministry. And I think he even mentioned some of that when he preached a few weeks ago, how there could be someone here who would be very wealthy, but his presence wouldn't be manifest until he wrote out check. Then we'd know he was there. And that God, because we know the Spirit of God lives in us, we could come to church and God could be here, but we don't always have him manifest his presence. If we really do desire God to manifest his presence, it could get scary because things might feel out of control sometimes and God might move in ways that don't feel safe and don't feel comfortable and leprosy might get on some things. And then he said something that set me free because I was going through a time where the kingdom stuff was real scary to me and I was backing away. And then he said these words. What happened to me is this. I began to be more hungry for the manifest presence of God than I was afraid of it. Do you understand that? I began to be more desperate to see God move than I was afraid of it if he did. So I said, I don't care what people think. I don't care what they say. I don't care what they do. I'm going to do that. Desperate. Those are the people who get empowered by God. And that is when the power of God gets released. It gets released in lepers. Is that good news to you? Who desperately come and say, God, you're my only hope. I don't care what people think. Tell you, we get people living like that here. God's going to be seen. It won't be Church of the Open Door. It won't be Dan Adler. It won't be Dave Johnson. It's God moving there. Because the people are desperate for him. Not for formulas. For him. He does it to lepers. Do you see, by the way, how this is a fleshing out of the Beatitudes? Blessed are the broken. Blessed are those who mourn, those who hunger, who come desperately. And now we're seeing it in flesh. Blessed you, leper, who come desperately. He not only came desperately, he came reverently. He bowed down. The word bowed down is proscuneo. I want to just give you a little trigger there. It's the same word that the Magi did. Remember when they bowed down to Jesus when he was born? They proscuneo and they said, Lord. They worship. Picture in your mind, if you will. I think this is important. Real vital. There's nothing here that lacks significance. This guy doesn't look good. He was full of leprosy, by the way. His body was full of it. So he was at the advanced stages. And he came there and he looked a mess on the outside. But on the inside, because of this, it reveals that something very real was going on inside. He worshipped him. He called him Lord. The picture that exploded in my mind while I was studying this was this. What a illustration. What a contrast. All through the Beatitudes, we were hammering away at the Pharisees. Remember that? And one of the theme verses I gave you was this. Jesus in Matthew 23, 23 said to the Pharisees, You guys clean the outside of the cup and of the bowl, and you look great, but inside you are vile and wretched, and you are decaying, and you are not part of the kingdom even though you look like you are. And now to this leper, who on the outside was the opposite of the Pharisees. He was vile on the outside, wretched on the outside, decaying on the inside, but life was on the inside. Jesus is saying in this illustration, here's my kingdom. It's totally opposite what you think. By the way, some of you are sitting here going, this is all you ever preach. That's the only message there is here. Blessed are the broken. It's the only one there is. And that's where grace comes and that's where healing comes and that's how power flows. You don't get it any other way. Getting big, let's get big. Okay, great. There are multitudes, beloved, of religious performers who are all decked out and look good. I'm wearing a brand new suit today. I just thought of that. You look good, Dave. There are multitudes of people who look good, who do look good. And I could be one. I don't think I am. I think I know my heart. But inside are vile and wretched and decay. But we do dress ourselves up. But where his kingdom comes and now these questions ring in my ears again. Why? Where is the church? Where do we see the power? We see it looks good. It's polished and it's hard to argue with. But how come? Where do we see the manifestation of God? Because we need to come desperate. We need to come reverent, broken. He works with the leopards, folks. It's always going to be that way. The marks of an effective church. How can you tell the churches where they go in places? Well, they've got a beautiful building. they're big and they're slick and they're rich and they know how to push the right buttons and they look good. I would like somewhere along the line the church growth people and I'm one of them would add this to their list and erase the others. I'll tell you the mark of an effective church when it starts getting filled up with lepers whose only hope is a touch from the holy God of heaven. God ministered to me this week gave me a gift. It wasn't a pleasant one. Now it feels like a gift. It didn't when I got it. Last Sunday morning, I was in a different church in Chicago. I already said it. 9,000 people were in this church. They only had two services. They had 4,500 in each service. And God was there. So anything I'm about to say is not about that church. It's about me and what Satan did with me and the whole thing. And I'm sitting there and I sense God's presence and I enjoyed it and it was great. And I was walking out and I was thinking, I can preach here. you know I'm getting set up right you know you feel that you feel good that long about that kind of pride you know you feel yeah I can do that feels good it wells up and all of a sudden it starts feeling like dust in your mouth but not only that I knew that wasn't where I was supposed to go I belong here but then I started thinking well how come we don't have a building like that I mean I work in significant how come we don't and I started feeling really down and discouraged and angry about this I shouldn't admit this stuff but I did that happened that happened to me and God began to minister to me about what I need to be okay those kinds of things but also that if we really do minister to lepers if we really do kingdom ministry we may never have a building like that and you know what today it's okay in here it is because lepers don't give a lot of money but that's where the kingdom is see and that's where my heart is today tomorrow I'll have to fight it all over again and so will you he came humbly too let's look at that Lord if you are willing I'm not even going to elaborate on this because it's enough of a thud to make us think without any elaborating if you are willing I do not hear any demanding there or commanding there I do not hear him listing reasons why Jesus had to do it I do not hear him coming to prove how worthy he was to get it he came humbly there is no name and claim it stuff in here he came humbly if you are willing he came desperate he came worshiping he came asking but he also came believing he also came believing some of you like it when I blow up the name and claim it thing but you need to know this his next words were this you can make me clean you can make me clean let me give you the balance here and it's extremely important that we get it by way of teaching he is saying this I affirm, Lord God, without hesitation, that you have the power on this earth to bring healing to my physical body. I believe that with all my heart. Therefore, I am going to ask that. It is not even going to be a benign belief. I don't believe that theoretically. I am going to bring God into my sickness. Ask for healing. But I am also coming to you, God, without hesitation, with this constant thing pulsing through my veins. Not only do I believe you heal, I also believe you are sovereign. And you will do what you will do, and it will be for your glory either way. and in either case I will believe you. There are some people who feel it's faithful to stick God in a corner and say, you've got to do it. And if it doesn't happen and the healing doesn't happen, it's obviously you didn't have enough faith. There are other people who are so scared of believing the kingdom power is real today that they never bring God into any kind of physical pain they've got. The first thing they would do before they ever ask God to intervene would be go to a doctor. Well, of course. Well, okay. I believe without hesitation that God has power on earth in this kingdom reality in which we live to heal the sick to heal my disease I also believe in and submit to his sovereignty to choose not to for whatever reason I don't understand either case I believe him that's how he came let's look at the response of Jesus verse 3 I love this part and Jesus he, Jesus, stretched out his hand and touched him. Stop right there. Question. Why did he touch him? Did he have to touch him? See, this is a formula. If you ever want to get into a healing ministry, the first thing you do is you lay hands on them. It's really important you lay hands on them. In fact, we lay hands on people here. We teach that here. And I'll tell you why in a few minutes. When people come forward, I want to put hands on them. why? well see I've never told you this part of me but see right here in the middle of your palm that's where the power of God comes out I didn't tell you that I thought it'd freak you out so I didn't tell you if this is some little formula for putting hands on sick people then I got a real problem next sermon coming to you with any integrity and explain to you why Jesus healed us centurion servant, and he didn't even go there. So that's obviously not a true thing. But I do think it's significant that he touched him for a couple of reasons. Number one, let me ask you a question. What kind of healing do you think this leper, now that we know some things about him, what kind of healing do you think he needed more than anything else? Physical healing. Of course, of course. I mean, the guy's a mess. The sword's all over. But I also know, see, I know about the ceremonially unclean, so this guy's filled with sin as far as everybody's concerned. I also know that socially nobody go within 150 feet guy. I got a feeling it was important that this guy who was hurting and scared and wounded got touched. Got touched. I believe, and this is why we put hands on people, I believe that hurting, scared, wounded, sick people need to be touched. You know why? Because hurting, wounded, scared, sick people feel like lepers most of the time. Don't you? When you're sick, when you're wounded, when you're hurting, when you're scared, when it's not fitting in, you're the life of the party, aren't you? You get invited to everything, don't you? You feel like a leper. People need to be touched. That is just a little teaching thing here in our church. Do that with people. Touch them. There's something even better than that, though, here. There is a picture of redemptive love here that blows my mind. I told you just a minute ago, or I've been telling you through this whole thing that lepers were ceremonially unclean. That meant sin was on them. Now there's something else you need to know. One of the reasons people didn't want to be around them was because they catch the disease. Another reason was because of the social stigmatism to the whole thing. The other reason, however, was this. If you physically touched a leper, you would not only get the disease and the social stigma, you would become ceremonially unclean. The sin that was on him would be on you. Jesus touched him. what does that mean in a spiritual sense what that is a picture of is this he who knew no sin became sin on my behalf so that I could become the righteousness of God in Christ does that sound like good news to you there's a message in the miracle do you see that way back in the beginning of John's baptism of Jesus do you remember that John's baptism was a baptism of repentance of sin and we struggled when we went through that well then why was Jesus being baptized If this was for repentance of sin, why was Jesus doing that? And the message that came clear then was this constant theme from the heart of God to us. I who knew no sin was going to become sin on your behalf so that you would know the righteousness of God. There is a redemptive picture in this miracle that we dare not miss because it's the essence of the miracle. He is doing more than a miracle. He's teaching who he is, what he cares about, what he came to do. Identify with sin and cleanse them lepers. Clean. I like that stuff the question was asked are you willing to cleanse the answer is this I am willing be cleansed and immediately the leprosy was cleansed and in a spirit sense and immediately he was forgiven and immediately he was made new and immediately he was recreated and immediately he was cured and immediately he became a son and Jesus said to him see that you tell no one but go show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded for a testimony to them let me just explain what that means real quick why did he tell him not to tell anybody he told him to do two things don't tell anybody and then he told him to do two things go to the priest and then do what Moses said to do without getting I could get lost in the details of this so I don't want to but essentially in Leviticus 14 there was a process you had to go through to be certified that you were indeed clean because we didn't want to send you back out to society unless you were and it involved an 8 day period of being there shaving your head showing all the sores and after 8 days there was a ceremony of cleansing and a picture of redemption and resurrection and then there was another 8 day wait and after that time if you were seen to still be clean the rabbis or the priests would give you a certificate of being cleansed. And you could put it on your wall and it would say former leper. That kind of thing. But what was going on here was this. Why did he tell them to go there first? I'm not telling you this. One of the things that was going on I think in the mind of Christ was that he was sending them there and if he tells everybody before he gets to the priest and they hear that Jesus did this and the rabbis and priests hear that they're going to be predisposed and not believe it anyway. And if you just go to the priest and you go through this process and it can be affirmed that you were cleaned, they're going to give you the certificate and then they're going to ask you a question, who did this? And you will say this, Jesus of Nazareth, who is God incarnate in the flesh, he reached out his hand and he touched me and he cleansed me immediately. And by the very certificate of healing, they would be verbalizing to the whole world Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father without even wanting to do it. That's part of what's going on in there. I could even make an application I don't want to get lost into this but part of the thing in terms of your cleansing is don't go shooting your mouth off about how new you are show yourself to be new then start to talk little thing I just wanted to explain that and now as I close I want to get back to the application of this whole thing there are many messages in the miracle we've dealt with today one of the messages is that this miracle like the others reveals the authority of Jesus to heal physically he has that authority today it also another message affirms that physical healing is part of kingdom life that he is God it reveals the heart of God as it relates to human need I will do it it reveals again that Jesus blesses faith wherever he finds it and he finds it in the strangest places but the best picture that is found in this is the picture that I've been sharing with you that it is indeed a picture of redemptive healing ultimate healing and that is the picture here that is the most vivid and the most vital. I want you to look again as I just wrap it up. Leprosy was disgusting and vile. But it was more than a disgusting and vile disease. It was a picture even in their minds of sin. And like sin it is ugly. And like sin it is communicable. And like sin it alienates you from people and from God. And like sin it is absolutely incurable unless the God of heaven reaches out his hand and cures that disease. But the leper with that disease came. How did he come? Number one, he came desperate. It doesn't matter what people think. I don't care what they say. I don't care what they think. I don't care what they do to me. I am not going to hold back. I am not going to hide. I am not going to stay away anymore. And he came reverent. He fell on his face and says, oh Lord God. And he came humbly. I demand that you heal me. He came humbly. Lord, if you will. And he came believing. I know you can. And then he asked the question, Will you make me clean? What did Jesus say? I will. I will. I will. There are some people here this morning who look real good on the outside. On the inside, you're vile, wretched, and decaying. And you know it. Nobody else does because you look good. There are some other people here who are vile, wretched, and decaying on the outside. If you were to stand up here this morning, you would have no problem at all because it shows you quit pretending already out here. My marriage is a mess. My life is a mess. I can't keep a job. I don't know how to love my kids. I just came off Saturday night. I was at a party last night, and I did things that I'm real ashamed of. You see, you're vile, wretched, and decaying on the outside. but you're no better on the inside. I got some real good news for you. And the good news is you could come like that leper if you've had enough pain, if it's gotten bad enough. And you could quit pretending what people think and you could come worshiping, you could come humbly, you could come believing and you could come and ask Jesus a question. Could you possibly make this mess clean? you need to hear the very voice of God thunder in this place I will I will I will make you clean all you got to do is ask by the way all this teaching another little teaching right now you need to get about healing every healing physical healing has the ultimate purpose of bringing divine redemptive healing. Jesus heals physically for the purpose of bringing people into faith that really heals the soul. I believe that the power of God is here to heal. I believe that. And if you're desperate and worshiping and seeing him as your source and can come to him humbly and ask a question, will you make me clean? You know the answer already. But some of you have never been redeemed and you need the ultimate cleansing. There are others who are believers and you need a cleansing of a different kind, maybe on the outside. And there are others who maybe God is speaking to you relative to physical healing as well. The power of God is here to heal. Physical healing, I don't know for sure you're going to be healed today. Emotional healing, there's healing for that. Redemptive healing, I've got a word for you. Will you make me clean? I will, absolutely, no doubt. resurrected from the dead today. If the Spirit of God is speaking to you, we want you to come. Let me pray. Father, I thank you for the fact that you have already communicated to my heart that there are lepers here today. And they know who they are. And maybe some aren't ready to come to you yet. They still care what people think. And I pray you keep moving on them, drawing them to yourself. But some of them here are desperate. and if you don't clean their heart nothing will because they can't and they know it and I pray in Jesus name that the lepers among us who need a touch from you would come and receive and feel your touch and experience your cleansing power to make them a new person and there are people here who are being spoken to by the spirit of God relative to physical healing and I pray that you would give them the courage to come and inner healing I pray your spirit be released here for you to do your work among your people here in Jesus name Amen you
