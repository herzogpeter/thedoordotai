The rest of you, open your Bibles with me to the book of Matthew chapter 13. Matthew chapter 13, we are in a section in chapter 13, all of chapter 13, is a section called the parables of the kingdom, or the mysteries of the kingdom revealed. And it began in verse 1, chapter 13, where on that day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting by the sea. Great multitudes gathered to him so that he couldn't see it on the beach anymore, and he got into a boat and sat down, and the whole multitude was standing on the beach. And he spoke to them many things in parables. A couple of weeks ago, I defined for you what a parable is. It comes from the Greek word parabole, which means to lay alongside something else. And the way it works is simply this. You tell a story, and in a physical arena, it makes sense. It's taking something that is physical, like a sower, and something that is natural or visible, like a seed or a mustard seed or a field, and then you lay that physical thing alongside something spiritual. And when you lay the physical alongside the spiritual concept, you extend the physical into the spiritual concept, and that physical picture gives understanding to the spiritual arena. Simply put, parables are profoundly effective ways to teach deep truth in spiritual areas in very simple terms. And what we learned last time was that if you have a heart to understand these deep truths, you're going to understand them. We also learned last time, by way of introduction, is that some people never will understand the mysteries of the kingdom. They will never understand the deep things of God. But understanding the deep things of God is not about whether you're smart or stupid, because that could really make you feel like, well, I just don't have what it takes. I can't get in there. The thing that draws the line between an insight into the realities and the mysteries of the kingdom and being blind to them is not an issue of the mind and how bright you are, but it is an issue of the heart and how sensitive you are and how broken you are and open you are to the word of God. Chapter 13, verse 14. They keep on hearing, but they do not understand. They keep on seeing, but they do not perceive. Why? Because their heart has become dull. and so it is about opening your minds and opening our hearts to the misuse of the kingdom he tells seven parables I hear a series coming on when I think of seven parables in this whole thing the first one is the parable of the sower it goes from verse 3 through verse 9 and then from verse 18 to verse 23 the way it's going to break down is this it's going to break down exactly the way I gave you a definition of a parable. The first thing he's going to do in verse 3 through 9 is lay down the physical picture. He's going to talk about a sower and a seed and all those kinds of things. And then in verse 18 to 23, he's going to lay the physical next to the spiritual and extend it into the spiritual so we understand it. That's the first two things we're going to do. Point number one, explain the physical picture. Point number two, extend the physical into the spiritual. Point number three, having explained and extended, we're then going to apply it to some real practical areas in our life. Verse 3, Behold, the sower went out to sow, and as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the road. Birds came and ate them up. Others fell upon the rocky places where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of soil. But when the sun had risen, they were scorched, and because they had no root, they withered away. And others fell among the thorns. Thorns came, choked them out. And others fell on good soil, yielded a crop of 160. And thirtyfold, verse 9, he who has ears to hear, let him hear. I feel compelled to share something with you just even before I pray. I don't often do this, but I need to this time. Every once in a while I struggle with this, and sometimes I don't. But in the first service, I feel like this text is extremely important and there's much here. But we don't make just speeches around here. What comes is, I hope, a work of the Holy Spirit empowered by the Spirit of God. And in the first service, I felt very strongly like I just delivered my soul. And I am feeling particularly weak in my spirit right now. And physically, I don't want my weakness to be getting in the way of what God wants to do. Spiritual truth, in my weakness, he's made strong. Would you pray for a fresh anointing for me as we begin? God, I'm tired, and that's okay, because you can still move with power. I do pray God that in weakness you're made strong that you show yourself with truth and power I pray in Jesus name for a fresh energy for a fresh anointing for a fresh word for the benefit of your body for the building up of the saints bring the plow of your spirit that breaks through the hard ground of our hearts even ways that we don't see it do your work among us in Jesus name I release your spirit in this place illuminate, empower, anoint, minister. Amen. Let's look at the picture. Let's look at the picture piece by piece, the physical, natural, visible story. Verse 3, behold, the sower went out to sow. That would be a common sight for the people in Palestine. The people to whom he is speaking would be able to register right now with an image of that. The image would simply be that of a man or a woman walking through a field with a bag of seed on their back. There would be an opening that would come out about here. They would either put their hand into the bag and broadcast the seed. By the way, that's what the word sow means. It means to broadcast. Any of you own a broadcaster? When you do your seed, it broadcasts the seed. It spreads it out. Or they would just take it and kind of shoot it out like that. It's even possible that Jesus, as he sat in the boat and looked out on the multitudes, would be able to raise his eyes up to a distant hillside and see someone sowing seed even while he's speaking. The point is it would be a common occurrence. It would be something that would be very typical in their experience. And as this farmer or this sower, this man or this woman is doing this work, one of the things he's going to notice and things he's going to run into as he functions in this field is a different response to the seed. There's going to be all sorts of different ways in which the ground is going to receive the seed that he plants. And as he sows, verse 4, some of the seed is going to fall in the road and the birds are going to come and eat them. Just look at the physical picture. The picture is this, Palestine is literally covered with fields, grain fields. Picture it in your mind. If you can, it helps me to close my eyes. I see just rows and rows and rows. And as far as the eye can see, grain just moving in the wind. But crisscrossing all of those fields of grain are paths. And these paths have a purpose in those days. There weren't any fences, there weren't any walls. One of the things that would separate your field from mine would be a path. The path would be three to five feet wide. I'm going to get on track here sometime. Three to five feet wide, and it separated our fields. It also would just provide a way for me to get from one field to another. It also provided a way for me to get from one town to another. They didn't have roads the way we know roads to be, and they would just walk through the fields to get from one place to another. You might remember in Matthew chapter 12, when Jesus, along with his disciples, violated the Sabbath by eating grain, they were walking through a grain field on a path on the way to another city. That's just the way they got around. The thing that is significant about the path, however, is this. Because men and women walk on it all the time, it is beaten down, it is hard, it is impenetrable. And so when the seed that the farmer is sowing falls on it, all it does is bounce off and fall off into the wayside. Luke adds this picture to the physical picture. Not only do they fall off into the wayside because it's hard, but sometimes the seed does just rest on top of the hard soil. And what happens then, it is trampled underfoot by men. People walk by, women walk by, they just mash it into the ground. The seed is pulverized and no life is engendered. The listeners at this point don't know any spiritual significance about this at all. And so they're simply saying, yeah, okay, I've seen that. Most of us farmers, however, don't throw a whole lot of seed onto the hard path. The guy's a carpenter. He ought to stick to his tray. You don't, you just stay away from that. Thank you very much, Jesus. But they're registering. They know what that looks like. The birds would come and take it away. Then he would go on in verse 5. Another seed fell upon rocky places where it did not have much soil. And immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of soil. I don't know what you picture in your mind, but for a long period of time, I would just picture soil that was basically good soil and had a bunch of rocks kind of stuck in there. That's not to picture. One of the things you need to know, again, historically or geographically, in Palestine, there are vast fields in Palestine, all through Palestine, of limestone and bedrock. And that's all the way through the whole country. But in certain places in Palestine, that bedrock and limestone surges very close to the surface. So in some places in Palestine, you've got the bedrock, but there's a lot of soil. In other places, the bedrock is very close to the surface, and you've got one or two inches maybe of topsoil where something can grow. As you look at the field, you can't spot that. It looks okay. It looks like good soil, but right underneath is a bedrock of resistance. And what happens in that kind of soil when the seed hits, it is this. Immediately it springs up because it has no depth of soil. Something caught my eye I want you to catch right now. It does not say it's spraying up. in spite of the fact that it had no depth of soil. It says it sprang up because it had no depth of soil. What does that mean? Well, like Jesus is a carpenter, and this might not be his element, I'm from Chicago, and agriculture is not my element. So I did some study. And I still don't know what I'm talking about. The thing about seed is this. When it gets planted, the first initial dynamic of its growth is not up, it's down. The root system begins to get planted. The root system begins to get established. I can, by the way, make a spiritual application right off the bat about that. Sometimes the work of God in someone's life is not always visible. We're always looking for something visible. I can see God's not doing anything there. Sometimes what God is doing are the deep things, the deep workings of God, and it doesn't show yet. But that's what the seed does. It starts shooting its roots down. The problem is this. After shooting its roots down, if it runs into a bedrock of resistance, all of a sudden there's nowhere for the energy that's being generated to go. So all of the energy that normally would be shot down and then up, all of it gets shot up. So this little thing just goes flying way up. It gets higher and it goes faster than any of the other grain. But there is a problem. This kind of growth is kind of artificial. What happens in verse 6 is the sun rises and then it gets scorched. And because it has no root, they wither away. And the farmers in the multitude listening to this story in the physical arena would be going, Yeah, I've seen that. I know what that's like. We've had to plow that ground up or just lose the whole crop. And I know what that's like. No big deal. Then it goes on in verse 7. And others fell among the thorns, and thorns came and choked out that life. Thorns or weeds. This basically is soil that Jesus is describing where the plowing has taken place. The hard places have been plowed up by the Word of God, by the Spirit of God, and by the people of God. And even the hidden hard places. We're going to talk a lot about the hidden hard places in our lives. Even some of those places have been plowed up by the Holy Spirit of God, and growth has come. And in this kind of soil, things are growing. But weeds have also come. Let me tell you something about weeds. And again, this doesn't take a lot of work. If I just let you off to consider what weeds do in a yard, you could come up with some of this application. I am not a gardener. I don't have a garden. I do have a yard. We live right next to a field. The field is full of weeds. Slowly but surely, the weeds are moving into my yard. I never planted them. Think about that. The weeds in my life in my yard, in your life in your yard, you never went there. I think I'm going to ruin my yard, put some weeds in there. They come. They get blown in by the wind of life. They get blown in by the trouble in your spirit. They get blown in by living in a fallen world. They're there. And what I do in my yard, because I'm such a great agriculturalist, is I see them weeds growing and I mow them. it's great they're gone i get four feet away from my yard and i go looks green to me there's a problem with that approach to dealing with weeds just like there's a problem when what you've got in your soil is a thin layer of receptivity but a bedrock of resistance underneath that is this you're going to have to get the root out or your yard's going to get choked off there isn't going to be any fruit there isn't going to be any life and I'm already making applications and I can't do that yet one of the things about the parables though is they are so full of imagery and power it just kind of comes out the pores of all these things okay, the hearer would hear this physical description of a field with weeds in it and they'd go, okay, I've seen that I know what it's like to have the weeds come into my yard and choke off my plants and have there be no life after there was really a lot of plowing and good things happened. And then he describes in verse 8 the good soil. And others fell on the good soil and it yielded a crop. And some of the crop was 100-fold and 60-fold and 34-fold. That is an enormous yield. This is soil that has been broken. This is soil that has even been broken in the hidden places. By the way, I hope you hear the word broken there. We've heard it since chapter 5, blessed are the broken. And all of a sudden, Jesus is doing the parables of the kingdom. We're still talking about what brings forth fruit is what? Broken soil. Hidden brokenness. Hidden places are plowed up. The weeds are consistently being dealt with, and the result is fruit. Not just a little bit. 160 and 30. Verse 9, he says, those who have ears to hear, let them hear. And again, if you're hearing this only on the physical level, which is where we need to try to stay, your response to that is, we have ears to hear what? What is it that I'm supposed to hear? And so it is, he takes the physical, and now point two, he's going to take the physical and lay it alongside the spiritual, and that starts in verse 18. Let's begin to transfer all the concepts. Now he extends it. Here then, the parable of the sower. The first concept we need to transfer is the concept of the sower. Who is the sower? Who is the one who's sowing the seed? Well, there's more than one answer to that. First of all, originally, the sower is Jesus Christ himself. In the same chapter, verse 37, we're going to hear another parable of the wheat and the tares. And the sower in that parable is the Son of Man, Jesus himself. There is a sense in which in every one of your lives, the Holy Spirit of God is the sower of the seed in your life. He is constantly coming to the soil of your heart and planting the word of the kingdom in your heart and calling you deeper and calling you to plow and calling you to clean and calling you to fruit and wanting to bring the life of his power to your life. And he is the sower. There's another way to view the sower, however. And not only is it Jesus and he sows the seed in my life and in yours, but as the seed of the word of the kingdom is born in my life and fruit begins to come, I become myself a sower in the field of the kingdom. And I become a sower of the word of the kingdom and the truth of God and a spreader of that in every one of us. Fits right into that metaphor. So I need to see it in two ways. Number one, as me a sower in the field. Number two, as me the recipient of the seed being sown by the spirit of God in my life. Follow that. You're going to have to let that thread go all the way through the sermon. And I'll nail it down for you a little bit at the end. What is the seed? I've already given that to you, but I want you to hear it right from the text. Behold, the sower goes out. Verse 19, and anyone who hears the word of the kingdom, what is the seed that is being sown? It is not just the general word of God. It is the specific word of the kingdom. Now, I want to get picky about something here. Generally, when I've heard this parable, it's always been taught to me that the seed is the Word of God. It's the Scriptures. Hear me. That's true. The Word and the seed that needs to be planted in me is the Word of God. The original hearers would not have thought that, though. Why? They didn't have the Scripture that we study. They had the Old Testament. They didn't have the New Testament. They wouldn't have thought, aha, he wants me to read Galatians this week. Didn't think that. The word of the kingdom was the seed that was going to bring life. Question, what is the word of the kingdom that has this life and this power? The word of the kingdom is what we've been hearing in Church of the Open Door for the last two years since we started Matthew. The word of the kingdom is this. Jesus is the king. The king has brought a kingdom. The kingdom is real. It is here. It has power, authority. It has deliverance. It has healing. It has forgiveness. And it has redemption. But the other word of the kingdom is this. All of that power and that healing and deliverance and forgiveness and redemption does not come to who? The self-righteous, the self-content, the powerful and the performer. That power and that authority comes to the broken, the hungry, the mourning. It comes to the leper who says, my only hope is you. It comes to the centurion slave who says, unless the power of God is released in me, I have no hope. It comes to the prostitute who says, I have such sin in my life. There is no way I can just change my behavior and get cleaned up. I need something deep inside of me changed. That's the word of the kingdom. For those who are broken, for those who are dependent, for those who have no other hope but grace, the word of the kingdom to you is there is hope, there is healing, there is deliverance, there is redemption and forgiveness. And that word falls on all sorts of different soils. And it brings different results. and part of what I think Jesus is doing here and you've got to have this picture in your mind is Jesus is talking to the twelve disciples in fact we know from Luke that he took them aside remember he told them the physical thing the Pharisees had hard hearts he took the disciples aside and said let me tell you what this means disciples you are going to minister the kingdom power and you're going to minister the gifts of the spirit and you're going to minister this healing redeeming power of God to people. But you need to know that as you move in the field like a farmer moves in his and you work your craft, as it were, that that seed of the Word that has life and power to heal and redeem is going to have different responses and if you don't know that, you're going to get disillusioned and leave the ministry. You're going to think, maybe I don't sow good enough. So know this, that as you sow the Word of the Kingdom and the power and the gifts and redemption and healing, that some people are going to hear that and it's going to bounce right off. They will hear it, verse 19, and not understand it. Why won't they understand it? I've already told you that. Because they're thick in their mind. They're not real sharp. That's not why they won't understand it. It has nothing again to do with whether you're intellectually capable or not. It's because they're hardened in their heart. That's why people don't understand. and the birds come and they snatch it away the evil one is the transferred concept the birds and the physical thing the evil one is Satan himself who comes and snatches away that power of life giving gospel Luke adds again as I said before what the birds don't get is trampled underfoot by men let me give you the picture putting it together this person with the hard heart the trampled down soil is a heart that is so pounded by the mixed multitude by everybody's opinion by this philosophy and that philosophy by this religious experience and then he had that religious experience by all sorts of different kinds of experiences in their life some of them extremely painful sometimes the reason you're dealing with a hard heart is you've got somebody who has developed for himself an armor that is so thick you can't get anywhere near what's really going on in their heart but what is going on in their heart is enormous pain, enormous fear. But they have developed for themselves an armor of resistance against anything that would penetrate it, so they somehow survive. And when the word of the kingdom of healing and forgiveness, which is the word they desperately need, comes to them, it just bounces right off, and it falls into the wayside. Or they hear it, and it lays on top of their heart, but as soon as they go to work, all the people's opinions just trample it right into the ground. No life. And then there are rocky places, verse 20. And the one on whom, and by the way, the metaphor, I think you've gotten this already, the transferred concept, the field is the heart of a man or a woman. That's the transferred concept there. The seed is the word of the kingdom. The sower is Christ. The sower is you and I. The rocky places. And the one on whom the seed was sown on the rocky places, this is the man who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy. But there isn't any firm root in himself, but it is only temporary. Why is there no firm root? Well, just like the physical picture we had, what you've got is somebody who's got a thin layer of receptivity to the gospel. Is he a non-Christian? He could be. A thin layer of receptivity to the gospel. Is he a Christian? He could be. I want you to do that, by the way, all the way through this. I've got to stop here and get you in on my thinking here the only way I've ever heard this parable interpreted is this you've got the three soils, the hard one, the shallow one, and the weedy one and none of those except Christ, the good soil is the one who receives Christ is that a true interpretation? yeah, you can look at it that way I want you also, as we go through this thing, to let into your spirit a whole other I think maybe just a deeper way to look at it and that is this every one of us have hard spots in our life where we are totally resistant to the voice of God, and I'm talking to redeemed people. Every one of us have places in our life where we have this thin layer of receptivity to the voice and the power of God, but there is a bedrock of resistance right underneath that. Every one of us, even believers, have weeds that come into our life that choke off the fruit of God's Spirit in our life. Look at it both ways, not just one. That's the point. This is the person, in my view, that maybe they're going along and they may be a non-Christian or they may be a Christian, And they're kind of tooling along and their life is working okay. And so they don't have any deep need for God. No big deal. No brokenness. All of a sudden some pain comes. And they become dysfunctional. And their life starts to crumble around their ears. And their wife just tells them she's leaving. Or the husband tells her he's leaving. Or something's dysfunctional at work. Or maybe a habit that they've kind of been holding like this. You know about those? Just kind of over here. Maybe every once in a while you indulge or got into it. You just kind of held it off. All of a sudden for some period it just overtook you. And you just felt scummy and dirty. And all of a sudden, you're in a context where your life is falling apart, and you hear the good news about the kingdom. There is forgiveness. There is healing. There is life. There is a new start, and you receive it with joy. Wow, it's great. And by the way, as I say this, I am not mocking that. That initial response to the good news that there's hope and there's healing is a real thing. But the problem is this. For many people, their receptivity to the good news of healing and the good news of forgiveness and redemption is received so that it will only alleviate or ease the initial pain. You got that? I'm in intense pain. I need some forgiveness. I wouldn't ever be willing to deal with this issue unless it got this bad. And now it's so bad, everything's crumbling. And now I need something to ease the pain so I can breathe again. And as soon as that, you know, so you come forward. And again, we do that. We bless that. That's real. But as soon as that initial pain is eased, I'm going, I'm better now. I took my Jesus pill. Oh, I'm glad that's over. And my wife was saying, okay, that I'm always responding to in order to just ease the initial pain. And if you want growth in your life and life in your life and health and real fruit born of God, you're going to have to plow deeper than surface acceptance. Let me tell you what else I mean by surface acceptance. Sometimes all we do in terms of the change, we change our behavior. Say you're getting heavy into alcohol. Okay, I'm not going to do my alcohol. No more alcohol. I throw my alcohol away. Into pornography, I'm going to throw my pornography away. Gone, it's gone. No more. And I receive it with joy, and I receive that new life, and I'm going to change my behavior. If all you do, beloved, is change your behavior, and you don't start being willing to let the plow of the Holy Spirit break through, the bedrock of resistance to the real change in heart that made you drawn toward alcohol in the first place and pornography in the first place and that prostitute in the first place and those outbursts of anger in the first place, you will not have anything that lasts. You're going to spout up with this wonderful behavior for two months and then the sun's going to come beat it up and you're going to dry up. Be back in the same cycle. Does that sound like anybody you know? I don't mean somebody here. I mean you. Look at there. I think one of the curses in the church is superficiality where we think that the only thing that we need just change my behavior I'll get a new change your behavior don't hear me saying don't change your behavior get rid of the stinking behavior don't however believe that by doing that surface thing you've really gotten close to the heart and some of you can even in your own spirit testify to the fact that I have changed the behavior No, okay, let's say you've had a real bad time with your kids. You've been screaming at them all week. I'm sick about that. I hate that. I don't like doing that. You come forward. I bless that. That's good. You ask God for forgiveness. You are forgiven. That's good. And now I'm determined, oh, I'm going to be nice to my kids. So I go home and I'm nice to my kids. And it lasts a week. That doesn't last that long. Maybe somewhere what I need to do in order to have real fruit born is let the plow of the Spirit and the plow of the Word of God and the plow of the people of God who give me good feedback and insight into some of my behaviors plow through what's underneath that, that bedrock of resistance that keeps me going back to that old behavior no matter how hard I try to change it. I'll tell you, sometimes the Word of the Kingdom falls on places where it looks like receptivity, spouts up with a little bit of joy, a little bit of life, but then the persecution, it says here, is the sun. That's the next transformable concept. Remember, the sun came in the physical, burns up the plant. Let's look at it here. The sun here is affliction and persecution. What is affliction and persecution? Well, before I actually looked at the text, I had it all figured out. Affliction and persecution is this. I come forward, I get rid of my pain, I take my Jesus pill, I don't want to deal with the real issues of my heart, I'm just going to change my behavior and feel all better, but then I go back to my wife. All right, I go back to my kids or my job, and the persecution or the heat of those relationships just burns it up again. That is not what it means. What I just said is a true thing. That kind of thing happens, but this text does not say affliction and persecution comes from going back to my kids or back to the world. It says here the affliction and persecution that burns up that shallow response to the word of the kingdom comes because of what? The word. What is this. What word? The Bible? Yes, but not specifically here. The original hearers would not have thought, oh, the Bible, the word of the kingdom, the power of God, the healing of God, the gifts of the Spirit, the redemption of God. The only way you get them is broken, hungry mourning. The only way you get saved is broken. The only way you get sanctified in your living is realizing in the flesh you can't do it. I come broken, God, if you don't sanctify me, I have no hope. The way you serve in the kingdom is broken. I don't have any hope unless, God, you somehow empower me and fill me and anoint me. There is nothing of value going to come. Broken, hungry, mourning the word, pounds and pounds and pounds, and we come forward, and we respond to the incredible pain in our life, and we want it fixed. And God comes, and he ministers to you, and it's happened to you many times. You've come, and you've gotten ministered to, and there is that initial, wonderful, redemptive healing experience. But then you come back, and you come back, and you come back, and if the word of the kingdom is being spoken here, you know what the word does? It keeps pounding and pounding and pounding, and you know what it does? It calls you deeper and deeper and deeper, exposing not just your behaviors, but your motives, not just what you do, but why you do it. Take that concept for a minute. Not just what you do, but why you do it. Take it as it relates to sin. I've already given you the alcoholism, the sexual stuff. Change my behavior. Throw away my pornography. It's not going to help. I'm going to have to figure out what it is in my spirit that's making me do that. Not only what I do, why I do it. Take all your religious activity, all the good things I do. You're going to have to let the plow of the spirit hit that too. What do you mean? Because what you do doesn't matter as much as why you do it. Why am I so committed to making sure I'm up at five in the morning to read my Bible? Is it because that's what the Spirit of God is born in my life, and I have a hunger and thirst for God? Great! Wonderful! That's fruit for God, from God, by the Spirit. Is it because that's what I need to do to prove I'm okay? Ha! Flesh, pal! That is a veneer of receptivity that has no power, and it's going to dry you right up. The word of the kingdom is brokenness, hunger, mourning. My only hope is you, and it's going to drive you deeper and deeper and deeper. And by the way, I think there's a process in this. I don't think the breaking up of hard stuff ever is done. You're going to break up this layer and you're going to go, that was hard, that was painful, that was hurting. I hated it. It was embarrassing, but I'm seeing fruit in there and all of a sudden after the fruit comes, that root's going to go deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and hit what? Another bed of resistance, right? You ever seen that? Probably not. We see it all the time. I think this person here is the person in chapter 11, verse 44, that we learned about a couple months ago, who swept the house clean, adorned it well, put it all in order. They made external reforms. Their life wasn't working, their marriage was crumbling. They decided to be better to their wife, but they didn't deal with what was really going on inside their heart that made them not get along with their wife or their husband or their kids or whatever. And it springs forth with wonderful life, but then it dies off. let me tell you the word of the kingdom is going to have two results in your life and in mine number one is it is either going to drive you deeper and deeper and deeper and it's going to call you to more and more brokenness and more and more mourning and every once in a while somebody comes up to me goes when are you going to talk quit talking about this brokenness so we can get on with life i got a word for you the word of brokenness the message of brokenness is never going to stop because brokenness creates dependence and you can't do anything in the kingdom realm without absolute dependence on God and that comes through brokenness. That message never stops. And it's going to go deeper and deeper and deeper. That's the word of the kingdom. The other thing it'll do is it'll burn you up. It'll burn you up. Because if you decide no more, no more, the word's going to keep pounding and going to keep pounding and it's going to dry you up and blow you away. and I'm not saying you're not a Christian anymore and I think you can enter into the metaphor of being dried up, can't you? no more passion, no more heart, no more stuff I said no let me enter into your pain a little bit on this the prospect of letting the spirit of God break through that kind of hidden hardness and the word of God breaking through it and the people of God breaking through it is not a very pleasant concept or prospect. The reason is, as I look at my field, and I look at the areas in my life where I have this veneer of receptivity, but hardness on the inside, it looks okay. You know, and even every once in a while, there's fruit being born. You know, boom, boom, boom. Every once in a while, something will spout up. The prospect of me allowing the Spirit to plow that up is not a pleasant one, because it's going to look messy, it's going to be dirty, and I can guarantee you that as I enter into that process of looking into my heart, examining my motives, what's really going on inside of my heart, getting in touch with some of the pain I've got, and I'm covering it with all this wonderful religious behavior and sappy smiles, is that I'm going to have pain like I've never had. And I'm going to wish to high heaven that I would have never started the process sometimes. But it is out of that plowing that the earth is broken, the seed gets planted, and life can begin to be born. That's a true thing. Weedy soil. Weedy soil. Verse 22. And the one on whom seed was sown among the thorns, this is the man who hears the word, and the worry of the world and deceitfulness of riches chokes out the word. And it becomes unfruitful. There's no fruit for God. Unfruitful could mean he never got saved. But I think that's the real small view of that parable. I think unfruitful means that in my Christian life, the fruit of the Spirit is not being born. The power of God is not flowing. I'm drying up. Why? Because of weeds. What are the weeds? Transferred concept, two things. They are the worry of the world and the deceitfulness of riches. What's the worry of the world? The worry of the world is what you know about. And again, let me tell you, tie this concept in with the weeds. You don't plant this stuff. You're not going around thinking, I want to get preoccupied with things that don't matter. You don't do that. It just comes from the yard next door. Okay? It comes from when you go to work. It's blown in the wind of the world. You, We live in a fallen world. And I'm sorry, we're going to get weeds in our yard. The best believer you know has got weeds. They didn't plant them, it just comes. The worries of the world. That is stuff like your career, your kids, your house, your money, your ministry. And all of that stuff at certain times in your life is real clean soil. You're loving your wife, not because you're trying to manipulate her, but born of a love for God. God's your source. You're able to love your wife. You're able to love your spouse. But all of a sudden, that whole thing gets turned around and you're sucking your life from them or whatever. Your ministry, that works for me well. This happens to me all the time. I'm constantly having to weed this out in me. And I never stop having to weed this. Where the ministry God's giving me is something that is just flowing. It's fruit from God. And it's born of the Spirit. But every once in a while, the weeds start getting in there. And I'm busy. And you get this way too. you get busy and you're doing and you're doing and you're doing and all of a sudden there isn'T any power, there isn't any life, you're drying up and you're blowing away and you're saying all the words but you can tell it's not coming from God. Because it isn't about God anymore. Because all of a sudden you started getting your life not from God but from your ministry and you started getting your life not from God but from your wife or from your kids or for how they look or how much money you have and all those things just choke out the power of God. we start living as if this life is all there is we start acting like our source of life are all these external things and again nobody ever says I think I'm going to raise some idols in my life I think I'd like to get my life from something that can't give it for a week nobody does that the weeds get planted and all of a sudden you can feel it in your spirit I'm drying up the weeding process to me is a process of constantly coming before the spirit of God asking him to search you coming before the word of God asking it to penetrate you coming before the people of God in kinship groups or the like and saying I need you to reveal to me what you see and then taking those things by the roots and taking them out this is my real motive this is why I do it I can't just smile and cut the weed off at the top I think we have to weed daily. I think it's a daily thing. All of a sudden, our priorities change. All of a sudden, our perspective is wacko. All of a sudden, our priorities are different. It happens to me daily. Sometimes you get them quick and they're easy to come out. Sometimes you've left it for a while and it really takes some work to get to the root of it. deceitfulness of riches is the same concept really the riches deceive what they do money possessions talent whatever it is that you may be rich in it gives you a promise the promise is this you pursue me you'll be okay you'll be full that's a lie god gives us all things richly to enjoy first timothy 6 17 says but just before that it says warn those who are rich among you not to put their trust in riches because they can't fill them. They can't make them okay. But there's a constant lie to us. These things I acquire, these things I pursue, these things I draw to myself, whether it be money or people's opinion, all that stuff is empty stuff. And that can deceive you. And if you buy into that at any level, it is going to cut off the real fruit of God in your life. there's a word from Paul on this that I think is so practical to us relatives of the weeds in our heart and it's this guard your heart make it personal for me David guard your heart guard your heart watch your heart watch your heart what does that mean to me now in light of this parable is this it means this David you're going to have to constantly weed what the world is blowing in it could be little habits it could be things that right now you're kind of entertaining things you watch, you listen to, where you're getting your life, little things, and you're going, it's harmless, and it is. The yard looks great. Right? You know what I mean? Just one week. There's a warning here. That stuff can choke it off. It can choke it off. It can choke off the anointing and the power and the fruit of God in your life. And then there's good soil. It's broken soil, but it's broken below the surface soil. It's not just a veneer of receptivity. It's tended to, washed with the water of the word, So there's a constant, God, I need you to, I love that song. It's a song, but it's also a psalm where David says, search me, O God, and know my heart. Know my anxious thoughts. See if there be a wicked way in me. I need you to look at, I want you to look at the soil here and clean it up and help me weed this thing. Again, you can mow it off or you can get down on your knees and pull that thing. That's work. That's work. And it bears fruit, this kind of soil does. And it's not just surface behaviors. fruit. It's not just, oh, see, it's weird. When people get right, all of a sudden they're in church five times a week, and they're having their daily devotions, and they're memorizing scripture. Please, have your memorized scripture. I'm not mocking that. Don't, please don't hear me that. Come to church. But you're going to have to go deeper than that, folks. You're going to have to go way deeper than that. Because the fruit of the Spirit is not being in church five times a week, or teaching a Sunday school class. It's love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, self-control, and that's heart stuff. That's below the surface. And to get that moving in me is going to take a plow. Because underneath the veneer of receptivity, I've got a better resistance to that. Because my number one priority is me. Love, you're crazy. I'll put this on. I'll be nice to you. I don't have time to go into that whole thing. By the way, it's called 160 and 30-fold fruit. Again, I don't have time to go deeply into this. I'll just kind of plant this seed in you and you can go with it. But what's interesting, the Spirit of God in this kind of soil begins to produce all sorts of exciting fruit, one of them being redemption, but then sanctification and powerful service in the kingdom. 160, 30. Where does that multiplication come from? A concept in agriculture that dawned on me this week is this. The seed for more fruit is where? It's in the fruit. Think about that. The fruit that God produces in me produces more seed that's going to reproduce life in you. It is not just my theology and my doctrinal rightness and my good behaviors that's going to produce fruit in me or in you. It is the deep stuff of God that has allowed the Spirit of God to plow up to hard places, weed out the junk, produce fruit for God that's going to produce more seed, that's going to produce more fruit, and it just keeps on going 30-fold, 60-fold, 100-fold. It's a neat concept. Let me go on to apply this whole thing. We've explained it physically. We've extended it to the spiritual. I want to apply it. In some ways, I'm going to say what I've already said here, but I want to nail it down for you. If you're taking notes, I want you to get this. I want to apply it in two ways, as it would apply to me, the sower, and then as it would apply to me, the field. Just write these down quickly. If you're a kingdom worker and if you're redeemed, you are. This parable teaches you some neat things about serving in the kingdom. Number one, it tells you this. You're not going to be able to win everybody. Let that encourage you. You're not going to be able to win everybody. Number two, because some people have hard hearts. Number two, the success of your ministry is not contingent on your ability as a sower. It is contingent on the life that is in the seed and the condition of the soil. Here's the picture. Heard this story a while ago. There's a father, and he's walking through the field sowing seed, and right behind him is his eight-year-old boy. And his father's been doing this for years, and so he spreads out the seed evenly, and his steps are even, and he can take long ones, and he doesn't throw a whole lot over there in the gutter. He puts it where he wants. And this little boy, wanting to be just like his dad, follows right behind. And he puts these big clumps of seed there, and there's another clump there, and there's a whole bunch there, and none there, and it's kind of uneven. And there are certain people who are new in the Lord, and you love Jesus, and the seed of God's life is in you, and you want to give it to everybody you've got. And there's another guy ahead of you who's walked in the kingdom and understands the kingdom truth and principles more than you do, and it's a little bit more even, and you're all discouraged because you don't do it as good as he does. I've got a word for you. The success of your ministry isn't in how well you sow. The success of the ministry is the life of the seed and the soil you put it in. There are people, I don't care how good you sow, that if their heart is hard, nothing can penetrate. I think of new believers, I just love it when I see this, but they take the seed of the life of God that they just got and they run home to their dad or their mom and they go, they give them the whole bag, you know? And then they come back and they're in my office and they're going, I just can't do this. I didn't do it right. I said it wrong. If I was just a better Christian. You know, they're so discouraged because they did it wrong and they didn't say it right. You know, and they're sure they're lousy sowers, so I'll never sow again. You need to know the contingence, the thing that makes success is not how good you sow. It's the life of the seed and the condition of the soil. And you just try to pour it on a hard heart and it's not going to work. That leads me to another concept here, another principle to glean. Don't waste a whole lot of time trying to get hard soil to receive the seed. Now, I know that might sound real hard, because you might have somebody you really love who's got a hard heart. And you might love somebody in the church who's got a really hard heart, and you spend all your time going, oh, please, oh, please. And they go, no, no, no, no, no. No response to God, no response to God. And see, the reason I need to tell you not to waste a lot of time there is because if you look right behind you, you'd find some people who are broken and hungry and mourning, and God has taken the plow, and there's all sorts of pain. And you know what? They're dying for the seed. Move from there to there. It's biblical. Chapter 10, Matthew. He was sending out the disciples, and what did he say? Guys, when you go out and you bring the word of the kingdom, I want you to do two things. I want you to preach the kingdom, but I want you to do the kingdom in the power of God. I want you to bring healing to bodies and to eyes and preach forgiveness to them. And know this, that some will receive you, and when they receive you, bless them, and give them everything you've got. Give them all the kingdom that there is to give. but some will resist you. And when they do, shake the dust off your feet and go. I'll tell you, that's a good word. That's a good strategy for you at work as you go to work. There are hard hearts there. Pray for them that the Spirit would plow, because He can. So be ready to sow maybe next week, because there might come some brokenness there. But look at the people who are in pain, who might be receptive to the seed, plant it there. I think it's a good word for pastors. I talk to pastors all the time. They'll come and generally they'll begin to talk when there's all sorts of pain and dysfunction. And they'll say, you know, Dave, I'm trying to bring this ministry going, and it's just hard. They don't have a response for God. They love the church and the building, and they want to fight about what color we paint the walls. And they might even be on the board, but the real life of God, they don't have any interest. But all of the time I hear this from them. Over here, during the week in my office, I'm dealing with people who are broken. This lady just went to a divorce, and she's getting all sorts of insight into God. and her healing is coming, and this guy over here was abused sexually, and this guy is coming out of a homosexual lifestyle, and they're broken, and they're receptive, and God's healing them. But over here, I'm spending all my time. I've got a word for you. Don't spend all your time there. And for some people, that means they have to leave their churches because their elders are the hard-hearted ones. You understand? So they go over here. That's where you put the seed. Understand that that's right out of this parable. The other thing, just quickly, don't get too excited about things that spring up fast. Just watch that. Let's be mature about that. Don't get too excited about things that go ba-boom, here, tears and cheers and all sorts of wonderful things. You see that? Bless it. I bless that. That's wonderful. But very often what you've got is a thin veneer of receptivity, but a bedrock of resistance under that, and as soon as they file up, there's nothing there. Be careful. I'll tell you something else about our ministry. We better be careful that we are not settling for the quick fix ourselves. And what I mean by that is just say the magic words, read the sinner's prayer, and everything's great. I don't care about your heart. Just say the words. That's kind of some residue from my past that I still have to plow through. If you said the magic words, you were saved. Baloney, what's going on in your heart? That's where the work of the Spirit is. Look for good soil. Plowed, plowed deep, soft, hungry, a beatitude attitude. That's where your ministry is. Application two, quickly I close with this. Not seeing yourself as the sower, but seeing yourself as the field. And I've said this all the way through the sermon. Again, I want to nail it down here. This was something that dawned on me this week. It's a new thing for me. I've always viewed this, again, parable, as only looking at people. And there's someone, and you have a hard heart, and there's someone who's covering hardness, and there's someone with weeds in their life. And then there's someone who's got soft soil. And I've even, you know, you kind of look, oh, I have soft soil. When you're looking at you, you've got to look at the whole thing different. The kingdom of God is in here. And the kingdom of God that is in here is like a field. And you need to know, and so do I, that every element of that field is in here. I can look at my life, and so can you, and I can see genuine fruit from God. I can. And that's not a brag. I don't even feel it. I just know I love God like crazy. And I have seen in my life places where he's broken me and just brought me low and at the same time created more dependence and from that has flown power. And I've seen that, and I've seen that over and over again. But I also know this about me, and this parable just puts it on a screen. Criss-crossing the fields of fruit and grain in my life are areas of hardness, where I have said in one way or another, no way, God, you're not getting in my heart there. I'm too scared of it. I have too much pain there. I've got this armor against it, and so every time the word of God comes to me relative to that issue or that area of my life, it just bounces right off. You're the pastor. You got hard areas? Yes. And you know what? I don't even think I know what they are. And I'll tell you something else. If you don't think you have them, one of two reasons. Number one, you're totally deluded or you're lying. Because that's a true thing. Every one of us have what we call blind spots where I don't see it. I don't see it and where it comes in here is search me God know my heart the way that thing gets plowed up is by saying God take the search light I don't like to do that because I'm used to that being hard and I got too much pain there and then there are other areas where as I've said through this whole thing I've got this veneer or this topsoil of receptivity to the voice of God and even people get excited to go yeah he's really hearing that he's really responding to that but basically underneath that that you don't see there's a bedrock of resistance to what God wants to do in my life in that area, whatever it is for you. And so every once in a while, it'll bear some fruit, so everybody will go, yeah, great. And I'll even think, yeah, I'm really making progress there. But it keeps hitting this bedrock of resistance that I don't see that either sometimes. Neither do you. And again, search me, oh God, and know my heart, and start plowing through that thing. But I'm going to tell you something again, we get satisfied with that kind of sporadic fruit, don't we? Because again, I've said this already, the process or the concept or the prospect, rather, of the Spirit of God and the Word of God and the people of God plowing that up, that hard resistance up, is very painful. And not only that, it's going to look sloppy. It'll look sloppy. You'll look back and remember when your field wasn't bearing a whole lot of fruit, but at least it wasn't messed up like it is now while God's doing some turning in your spirit. Also, the weeds. Always the weeds. Every day. All the time. Blown in by the wind? I didn't plant them, neither did you. You didn't try to figure out how you could choke off the life, how you could choke off the spirit and the passion and the heart for God. The weeds just got blown in. It could be your job, it could be your kids, family, money, house, whatever. You lost your perspective. You started living like this life is all there is. maybe you're even to the point where you've spotted some weeds and you've just been mowing it i'm going to change my behavior i'm going to be nice for a week but you never got the root the word to you is this guard your heart guard your heart guard your heart we hear often in the media right now of people who are in ministry really goofed up and one of the things I've heard about the people who are really in a lot of pain and really obviously dysfunctional is, you know, I knew about them a long time ago, and it was really okay. It was a good ministry. What happened? I don't know. I don't know. Weeds? Maybe. Maybe weeds. Blew in. Did they plant them? No. Power, money, loss of perspective, chokes off the fruit. No more fruit. If you don't think that's possible, hear the Apostle Paul where he says in 1 Corinthians, I don't want to be rendered useless. He wasn't going to lose his salvation. He was going to be rendered useless in his ministry. Weeds, guard your heart. I leave you with this. It's a process that's never done. What I just gave you, if you apply it to you, is a process that is never done. Constantly plowing hard in places where you're deaf and you're blind and you're hard. Constantly allowing the spirit to take you deeper and deeper and deeper. Constantly being aware that weeds could choke off the life. And then that whole process, as you go deeper and deeper, Good soil is being produced at the same time, and there's fruit. And see, don't let the fact that some fruit is being born knock you off that there are still hard areas that need to be dealt with. I think that's as good a description of the Christian life as we're going to know. That's it right there. A life that bears fruit for God has a perspective that says my heart's like a field. In it there is real fruit, and I thank God for it. But in it there is also crisscrossed hardness, hidden hardness, weeds like crazy. Search me, O God, and know my heart. see if there be a wicked way in me and lead me and give me the courage to handle the pain when your plow begins to come through the hard spots, the hardness, the resistance because I don't want to look at my pain and I don't want to look at my dysfunction I just want to change my behavior and put on a smile but you know what, the word of the kingdom isn't going to let you do that it's going to beat on you like a sun and pound and pound and pound and either drive you deeper or burn you up. Let's stand and be dismissed. I don't know how you need to respond to this. Some of you may need to just sit where you are and mull this over, percolate it. Some of you may need to go to dinner and deal with it. I don't know how you do that. Some of you may need to come. And we want you to know that every Sunday we have a place open here for people to pray for you, work through some issues. If God especially is speaking specifically to you about an area of hardness or weeds or sin that needs to be repented and pulled up by the root, don't leave this morning without dealing with some of that cultivation today. Because God has fruit for you. He really does. Let's pray. Jesus, I pray the power of your spirit be released right here for ministry. I pray you bring your gifts. I pray, Father, that you would allow some who need to just sit in their seat, to have the courage to just quietly sit in their seat, let their husband or their wife leave for a while and just be alone and continue to listen to your spirit relative to blind spots, whatever. God, there are some who need to come up here and experience the power of the kingdom, a real intervention kind of thing for forgiveness and cleansing and maybe they feel like they're past hope and they need healing this morning to start the process of plowing and God give them the courage to come. Bring your gifts to minister to your people right now in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
