I'm going to talk about the process of grief and the concept of grief and what that means, what it looks like. I really think that grief is a natural kind of thing that everybody experiences at one point or another. Despair, that's a good word in terms of what it feels like. But grief is a process. And a lot of times what happens, the goal of grief or the purpose of grief is to go through the grief and come out the other side, having experienced the loss and not having it interrupt your life. Because when a loss first happens, it really interrupts your life. And it really has an effect on how you live and how you feel and how you relate to others. and the grief process is kind of like just a gateway to go through or a channel to go through so that when you come out the other side, you can actually bear the weight of the loss and it doesn't interrupt your life anymore. I don't want to put some kind of psychological grid on grief or sadness or despair or whatever and then try to fit things into it. I think that the best studies that have been done in the area of grief Elizabeth Kubler-Ross did a book on death and dying that was about the kind of grief and sense of loss that a person has who's dying in their experience with their own death. But grief is something that people have observed. In other words, what I want to do is just kind of lay out for you what has been observed in people who have experienced loss. And it's a common kind of thing. It's a thing that if this person over here had a loss, you would observe this in them. And if this person here had a loss, you'd observe it in them and you'd observe it in these people. You'd observe this process wherever you looked where there was some kind of loss or heavy kind of sad experience. It happens at different rates for different people, but it's a natural, normal process. And the problem is not the process. The problem is when we put ourselves on a schedule trying to do the process or when we try to live up to some external standard that says we shouldn't be feeling the way we're feeling. And people get stuck in grief and get to feel that kind of experience longer than they'd have to if they just went through the process. So I'm going to talk about some stages of grief. Grief happens when you have lost something or someone that is important. It doesn't have to just be a person, a loved one. It can be any kind of thing. And I'll talk about that when we get a little bit farther on, what are some of the things that people grieve. First stage of grief is the stage of denial. And denial, the denial stage is, the reason I think that we enter that stage is because when we experience a loss, for us to have to, or for us to go through feeling all of the feelings that we'd feel because of that loss all at the same time right now, we couldn't bear the weight of it. We couldn't make it. It would destroy us. Denial is kind of an automatic defense mechanism. It isn't something you even have to plan to do. If you've ever had someone close to you die or you get a phone call and someone on the other end says so-and-so died, our first response is like, wow, I can't even believe that. Wow, I just had lunch with them. It's hard to let in because the weight of that emotionally is so heavy that in order to bear all that weight right now, we couldn't be able to bear it. So we go into a denial stage. Denial is an automatic kind of thing. It's because of the gravity of the emotions. The emotions would be so heavy we couldn't stand it. We couldn't live. We couldn't function at all. And so we go into this denial stage, and that's just a normal thing. some kind of denial is intentional and that's a different kind of thing than what I'm talking about when I lost my hair, I started losing my hair when I was about 14 and I said to my mother, I used to see all this hair around the bathtub and I say to my mother, it's terrible and I'm losing my hair, and she said, no, it's no big deal everybody loses 253 hairs a day which is true, but most people grow 253 new ones to replace the ones they lost, which wasn't happening with me. My hair was losing ground here, you know, and so it was terrible. I don't know if those of you who have experienced that, but it's an awful thing. And so I did some denial kinds of things, but it was an intentional thing. In other words, one of the ways I denied it was I parted it lower and combed it over the top, you know, like as if no one's going to notice or something. and that's a way to act like you're not as bald as you are and that didn't work after a while and so then I started to part it in the back and comb it over the top and I looked like I was on some runway when a jet took off but see, the thing about that is when I'd go on a date if the lady that I was with would touch my hair I'd grab her hand and say, don't touch my hair It wasn't like I didn't know this was happening. I knew this was happening, and I was intentionally denying the reality of it. In my own kind of process of chemical dependency, when someone would confront me about my inappropriate behavior, I knew that I had been inappropriate. When I would make an excuse or blame somebody over here or minimize the seriousness of it or whatever, in other words, deny that that had happened, I was doing that intentionally. and the problem with intentional denial, denying on purpose, denial mechanisms are blaming somebody else. I'm not responsible, they're responsible, denying that you're responsible. Minimizing how serious it is, denying the severity of it, denying by rationalizing, different kind of things. If you do those things long enough on purpose, denial leads to delusion and delusion is a little bit different. delusion is that you actually begin to believe the excuses. It isn't like you're just saying the way it is and you know it's different than that, but you're just saying it to get somebody off your case. It's that after a while you get a way of thinking, a deluded way of thinking that's almost like a grid. And when information passes through the grid, it gets twisted somehow so that on your end of the grid you see it completely different than what's real. It's not making excuses anymore. It's not, how can I get them off my case? It's, how can I tell them the way I really see it? So then when you finally say your answer, by the time it's received on the other end, the person, it looks real different than the way it went in. It's totally twisted up. And then you think that you must have seen it wrong, you know, and you must be wrong and they must be right because they're so sincere and they're so convinced in their answer. And it's not that they're so sincere, so convinced, it's that they're deluded. They're just saying it the way they really believe it. Now, the kind of denial that I'm talking about here is not that intentional kind of denial. It's not that kind of denial. You can have that kind of denial when you have a loss, a death of someone. You can have intentional denial. Some people I know of people who have lost someone in their family and they keep their room exactly the same way it was when they lived there and they don't touch anything in the room. That is intentional denial. that isn't, I can't believe this maybe for a while it was hard to go in the room because going in the room would evoke all kinds of emotions and so to not have to feel that you don't go in the room but I even remember when my mother went in the room where my dad's stuff was and sorted through it that meant entering into all that stuff and denying that the reality of that was over and now it was time to enter into that but some people get in that intentional denial and they get stuck there and they stay in the denial and they never go through the grief process so that that issue is really over with now and so it looks over because they're not attending to it but really what it is is it's just denied and it's over here and as long as we don't look at it, we're okay. So denial is the first stage. I think that God has built us wondrously. I think that the fact that we go into denial when we have a really terrible loss is a gift. I think that it's great. When my father died, I knew he was going to die for a whole year before he died. He had cancer. He had an operation. He was in bad shape. I knew he was going to die. When he died, I couldn't believe it, even though I knew the whole time this was going to happen. Our minds are so powerful. God has created us to be so powerful that there's a denial mechanism in us that just flips into gear when there's a kind of a loss. We know how things should look. We have a sense of how things should be so strongly that sometimes when they're not that way, we still see them the way we know they should be or we wish they were. And that's a denial of reality. I have heard of an experiment at one of the eastern colleges where they put glasses on people that flipped the picture upside down. And they wanted to test how long it would take people to figure out how to go up stairways that really went down and go through doorways that came from the top and those kinds of things. And an amazing thing happened. What happened was that after about two days of wearing these glasses, the people's brains flipped the picture back right side up. So they didn't have to adjust at all. It's like you knew what it was supposed to look like. They didn't go, I'm going to work on flipping this picture over. Their brain knew what the picture was supposed to look like and eventually just flipped the picture. Of course, then when they took the glasses off, everything was upside down again. And then their brain had to do it again. I have heard of studies where they have taken playing cards and they have given somebody a test where they flip a card every.96 seconds. You know, flip a card. And your job is to say what the suit of the card is. So they're flipping these cards. And about halfway through the deck, they change the spades to be red and the hearts to be black, and they just keep flipping them like this, and people get the whole second half of the deck wrong because they know what it's supposed to be like, and so they see it that way. And that's a form of denial. It's an automatic thing. Our minds are so powerful, and I think that that's a built-in survival mechanism when we go into denial after we experience a loss. I think it's a gift. It's an okay thing. Second stage. second stage is the anger stage the first stage is denial in the sense that this can't really be happening I can't believe this happened the second stage is that oh man this really is true and I'm angry this is terrible now the study that Ross did was about people who were terminally ill and it was like this can't be happening to me was the first stage and the second stage is this is really happening to me and lots of anger about that. I just want to teach you a little bit about anger. In the New Testament, there's three Greek words for anger. I want to read them to you just to give you a little bit of an understanding about that because I think that anger is really misunderstood and I think that typically Christians and churches and Christian places are not okay with anger. But in Ephesians 6, verse 4, it says, and fathers don't provoke your children to anger. Now, the Greek word for anger there is paragosmas. And what that word means is seething hostility. It's under the surface, bubbling, churning anger that you can't really see, it's not straight anger, it's just stuffed anger. In this verse, it's a very negative thing. The instruction that Paul is giving fathers, parents, is don't get your children to do this. Don't cause or provoke your children to seize their anger. Now what's ironic about this is that I see that a lot of people teach their children to seize their anger because when their child gets angry, we tell them they shouldn't be angry. And so when they come up to you and they say, Mommy or Daddy, I'm really angry with you, or I'm really angry about that. See, that's anger that's out here. And when we say good Christian kids aren't angry, they just see their anger. And they put it under the surface, and we think almost naively that if you can't see it, it's not there. Not showing your anger is the same as not having your anger. And that's not true. Not showing it is the same as not showing it. so the goal of anger is not to see that it's not to get it onto the surface thinking that we lose some kind of spiritual points if we let our anger out or we gain some kind of spiritual acceptance if we don't have anger even if we really do have it but nobody can see it so the goal isn't to see their anger that's a negative kind of connotation to this word second Greek word for anger is in Galatians 5 and let's see it's in verse starting with verse 19 it says now the deeds of the flesh are evident which are immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery enmity, strife, jealousy outbursts of anger now the Greek word for anger there is thumas and thumas means outbursts of anger it means explosive anger pow Now, one of the things that I think about this kind of anger is that this is the kind of anger that happens if you get good enough at doing the first kind of anger. After a while, if you seize your anger long enough, I think it comes out in an explosion someplace. And sometimes, and most often, it goes where it didn't belong. It goes on something that it wasn't about. It comes out bigger. You or maybe somebody else goes, where did that come from? That was not that big of a deal. This big thing came out. How did that come out? and that's an explosive kind of anger. The fruit of the Spirit verse in Galatians 5, but the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience. The Greek word for patience there is makrothumia, which means slow to anger, but it's slow to explode your anger. So in other words, in order to be slow to explode your anger, what that means is that you'd have to have anger to be slow to explode. Do you understand that? You can't be slow to explode anger that's not there. I don't want to get into a big talk on what the fruit of the Spirit and what walking by the Spirit and walking by the flesh is about, but outbursts of anger is when you live walking by the flesh, meaning spending a lot of energy and effort trying to get a sense of okayness or fullness or acceptance or value or life from the flesh, which is natural things around you. And when those things get knocked over or damaged or dented or hurt or dusty, we get angry. And it's just a natural consequence. The fruit of the Spirit and the deeds of the flesh are not some list of behaviors that we're supposed to perform or not perform. And we're not supposed to not do the deeds of the flesh or do the fruit of the Spirit. We're supposed to walk by the Spirit. And when we walk by the Spirit, meaning continuing to draw our life and acceptance and value from the Spirit, whatever that means, what happens is the fruit of the Spirit. Love, joy, peace comes out. It's a consequence, just like if you get your sense of okayness from around here, what comes out is envying, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, and those kinds of things. They're just consequences of where you get your life from on an ongoing basis. So this thumas is an explosion kind of anger. The third Greek word for anger is the word orge. And this word is found in Ephesians 4. And what it says there is, verse 26, Be angry, that's this anger, Be angry, yet don't sin, and don't let the sun go down on your anger. and don't give the devil an opportunity. Be angry yet don't sin. So it is possible to be angry and not sin. This kind of anger is what we would typically call just regular everyday anger. It's the experience of feeling angry. It's anger. And what it means, simply, it's very simple, is it's a signal, it's an emotional signal to tell us that something that is important to us has been threatened. or something that is important to us has been damaged. Something that we're committed to has been hurt. So it's just a signal, and if you learn to pay attention to this anger, you will learn a lot about yourself, because frankly, by watching what you get angry at, you can learn to see what you're committed to, or what is important to you. You can draw some conclusions about what's important to you by what you get angry about. If you ignore this signal, you're going to ignore that lesson. You won't see that lesson. You won't find out those things about yourself. But it does say, be angry yet don't sin. The context of this is, therefore, laying aside falsehood, meaning don't lie, speak the truth, each one of you, with his neighbor, meaning tell each other the truth. So don't lie, tell each other the truth, speak truth, each one of you, with his neighbor, for we are members of one another, be angry yet don't sin. I don't believe that it's a coincidence that those two verses are right next to each other. I think that what those verses are saying is that it is possible to be angry and don't sin. So if you're angry and you tell falsehoods, that's a sin. If you're angry and you don't speak the truth to each other, that's a sin. If you're angry and you go over here and tell this person how angry you are with that person over there, that's a sin. If you're angry and you go blow up somebody's car, that's a sin. If you're angry and you stuff it and turn it into progress moss and let the sun go down on it and don't deal with it, that's a sin. If you give the devil an opportunity to twist it and compound it and make it explode on somebody, that's a sin. But if you're angry with someone and you go toward them and tell them what's going on and what you're angry about, all you're doing is having a relationship with them and that's the only hope that reconciliation can happen anyway, which is what the cause of the anger was. Be angry yet don't sin. And so when the person experiences anger in the grief process, all that means is that something that's important to them has been damaged. Someone they love isn't here anymore. They've been taken away. Their health is gone. Whatever. People grieve all kinds of things. I'll get into that. But the anger is just a normal response to it. And the next kind of stage is the stage that tries to make sense of the anger. It's a kind of a blaming stage or kind of a bargaining stage, blaming and bargaining. And what that means is that now we've got this loss in our heads. It's kind of a head thing. This anger is a heart in our emotions response. It's a normal response. We get angry at the person who died for dying. We get angry at ourself for not being able to fix the person who died. That's one thing I experienced really powerfully when my father died is that in my family, my role was kind of the family hero and I was kind of the trophy of the family that everybody pointed at and he could do it all. And now my dad's got cancer and I can't do anything. And I was really angry with myself because that went against everything I knew about me, which is if something needs to be done, I'm supposed to be able to do it and I can't do it. And the more I do, he just keeps getting sick. And so I was angry about that. This blaming, bargaining stage is kind of a way to make sense of the loss or to focus it on something. So it's like in your head, I was angry at the doctors. They should know what to do here. They're doctors. They're getting paid for this. They've been trained for this. They can't do it. Like doctors are supposed to cure people who can't be cured. Well, see, I can say the 7-year-old dad was going to die and I was angry at the 80-year-old guy for not dying instead. It just gives a place for all this to go. That's all. But the fact that this is here just means that something that's important to you has been damaged or hurt or threatened. And that's a normal signal. Now, like I said before, if you learn to pay attention to that, it'll teach you some things. So if you're at a picnic and someone gets a bigger ice cream cone than you do and you get angry about that, what does that say? It says ice cream's important to you. You have to think about that. It's like, well, maybe, is that what you want to be important to you? You can get angry about ice cream cones and then say good Christians don't get angry about ice cream cones and then pretend not to be angry even though you are and call it spiritual, I suppose if you want to do that. It sounds like lots of hard work to me. Or you could ask yourself, is this something that I want to be important to me? Why is this so important to me? Can I change my mind about how important this is to me? I guarantee you that if you change your mind about how important ice cream is to you, you won't get angry when someone gets a bigger ice cream cone. But then the anger doesn't come just like it did come before, but it's not a trying hard thing. It's just a result of where your focus is or what's important to you. One of the things that my anger about my dad got me in touch with was how important he was to me, which I didn't know how important he was to me before he got sick. We kind of had some dynamic like this in our relationship when I was in high school and college, and I kind of left on a sour note. And now he's dying, and all of a sudden, all my anger about the fact that he was dying and got me in touch with the fact that he really was more important to me than I was letting on. That's a good signal to know. The anger was a valuable tool for me. The problem is that sometimes it goes where it doesn't belong. It explodes out on somebody else. And so that's why if you're in a relationship with someone who's in the grief process and they're angry, sometimes it lands on you. And it's because they're trying to find a place to put it. They put it on God. The bargaining part of this is also kind of trying to make sense of this in the sense that it goes something like this. Well, if my father would have gone in sooner, this wouldn't have happened. It's just trying to make sense of something that just doesn't make sense. If the doctors would have done this test instead of this test, this wouldn't have happened. That's kind of the bargaining thing. If then. If that other person wouldn't have been at the bar, this wouldn't happen. If they would have been driving at a different speed. See, all that stuff is probably true. But it doesn't make the grief go away. What it does, though, is it does get the person out of their emotions into their head. And that's even, I think, a gift, too, because when you have such a loss, you can't just live down here the whole time. It just eats you up. And so even then, it gives you a break. You come up here, try to figure it out. some bargaining looks like if I was really angry about the fact that I'm sick and I asked God to heal me but I was too angry when I asked him I'll try asking him nicer maybe this time he'll do it that's a bargaining kind of thing like it's a deal we're going to do a deal and there's going to be a payoff on the end for me like maybe if I'm sick and I go and do medicine and that doesn't work, then I'll try doing herbs. If that doesn't work, I'll go to a chiropractor. If that doesn't work, I'll change my diet completely. If that doesn't work, I'll go get prayer. Wow. See, that's all bargaining kind of stuff. It's a person who is despairing, looking for some sense in this, and it's not a bad thing. It's just that God does it the way he does it. And it isn't like, it's kind of like trying to figure out the right formula to make this thing turn out okay. And God does it the way he does it. Sometimes he heals people by just healing them, and they're healed. And everybody goes, wow, you know. And sometimes they change their diet and the problem goes away. And sometimes they die and it doesn't go away. but we get in this bargaining stage because here's this terrible thing and we want to make sense of something that just doesn't make sense. So that's just normal. But it doesn't work. In other words, it's almost like it's just the next stage. And even when I'm saying stages, you know, I don't want to make it look like it's so neat that you're only in one of these at one time. You know, it's like people flip in and out of these and sometimes they experience many of them at the same time. But it is a process. It is going toward an end. The fourth stage is depression. Now, see, the reason why depression comes is because all the places that your anger is gone don't work. In other words, I've talked to people who are really angry at God because such and such happened, and at the same time they're angry at God, they're telling themselves, well, you know, it's not his fault, they shouldn't be angry at God. They're kind of in their head about their anger, talking to themselves about how they shouldn't be feeling the way they feel. And, of course, sometimes people who want to help are telling them they shouldn't be feeling the way they're feeling too, you know. And so the feelings don't have a safe place to go like this. Dave's going to do some stuff on Job during this course, and there's a verse in Job where Job says to the three guys, he says, don't you know that the words of a desperate man are as the wind? It's like people who are desperate say stuff. They just say stuff. And you need to know that because that's not about you. But if you think it's about you or you think that you're supposed to fix that, then you'll tell that person things that give them the message that they're not supposed to feel the way they feel. and so what happens then is that these feelings are going in all these different directions it's not doing any good person's up in their head trying to make sense of it it's not doing any good you can't make sense of it, it stinks so the feelings go in and they get pushed down and stuffed down and controlled and what happens then is depression now depression is David Siemens wrote a book called Healing for Damaged Emotions and in this book he says he thinks that depression is God's built-in safety mechanism. It's kind of like if you don't take care of yourself on purpose, your body says, okay, it shuts down. Now you're depressed. But see, that kind of depression is a gift. And I don't know if any of you get depressed after the holidays or during the holidays, but one of the reasons why a person gets depressed, I think, during the holidays is because holidays are so much work that they don't take care of themselves. They use up all their juice. They just burn it all up, and now they're completely out, and now they're tired. And what should someone do when they're tired? Sleep. But they don't sleep. They just keep doing it more and following lists and pleasing these people and making it look this way and all this kind of stuff. And the more tired they get, the harder they try, and pretty soon their body and their psyche just says, Okay, see ya, until they shut down. And they can't move out of the chair. That's a gift. It's like pay attention. But see, when a person gets that kind of depressed, what happens is that now they have to sleep. They're tired all the time. They can hardly get out of bed, so they're sleeping. Well, what did they need to do? They needed to sleep. So now they're sleeping. Well, guess what happens when the tired person sleeps? They get rested up. And so after a little while, that kind of depression, the depression works, if I can say that. It works. A person's juice comes back, you know, they're all rested up, they're replenished, the depression lifts, and they go, where did it go? I didn't even do anything. Yes, you did. You took care of yourself. You slept. You didn't do it intentionally, you know. Maybe that would be the next step, learn to take care of yourself intentionally so you don't have to get depressed every holidays or whatever, but it's just a normal kind of thing. Depression is like frozen anger. It's like frozen, heavy feelings. And it weighs a lot. And so I wish I had the things up here to do this illustration, but it would be like if something happens in a relationship and you feel sad about it, that sadness would be like this. It would be like the weight of this. this Bible. And so that just weighs a little bit, you know. And if I handed that to this person in the front row, they're sad. This is the sadness. It's just a little bit of an emotional reminder, some pain there. And what they need to do is they need to deal with this. Do what they can to resolve this. But let's say they don't. Let's say they just decide to keep this and just put it back here or just carry it or whatever. Well, you see what's going to happen is after a while, they're going to get accustomed to it. They're going to be able to carry it without hardly even noticing it. Now they're having a relationship issue with somebody else and they feel really hurt about what happened there. That would be like another one of these. So now they've got a couple of these. But after a while, you might get so good at doing it that you just don't even, you're not even bothered by it anymore. You're just accustomed to it. But now you've got two of them. You weigh this much twice, twice this much heavier than you did before emotionally. And if you keep making those kinds of choices, pretty soon you've got all this stuff that you're having to carry and you can't carry it anymore and you shut down. And now you're supposed to go do the housework. Can't. Now you're supposed to go do your job. Can't. Now you're supposed to go play with the kids. You can't. You're underneath all the weight of all this kind of stuff and every once in a while someone kind of gets in the way of it and you go, just spill a bunch of these on top of them and they go, wow, I didn't even do anything. It's just that... It's just because it's going in instead of out. And then when it does come out, it comes out crooked. Instead of, be angry, yet don't sin, speak truth, each one of you, with his neighbor, for we are members of one another. And so depression is just a natural consequence of carrying all this stuff. Pretty soon you can't carry it anymore, you shut down. Another example of depression would be if I had a phone here with six buttons. And you and I have a relationship, and that would be one of the buttons. So we're talking to each other and we have a big argument or whatever, some kind of tension or problem in our relationship. Instead of talking it through and going through it until it's resolved, we just hit the button. We're so spiritual that we don't get upset with each other, even when we're upset, that we just hit the button. And we try to look like we're not angry when we are angry. We try to look like we're not hurt or frustrated or whatever when we are. We just hit the button. So that button just blinks now. And it's just a little bit of a reminder that something's not finished here. And it just blinks and blinks and blinks. But I've got six of these, so I just open up another one over here. So now we're having our relationship. Same thing happens. Instead of dealing with it and going through the mess of it and the heaviness of it, I just hit the button. Now it's blinking. Now I've got two of them blinking. I keep making those kinds of choices in my relationship, and some of us have learned to do that style of dealing with our emotions to survive the pain we came from. It's the only way we were able to survive that kind of pain. So we just do that automatically. Now we've got all of our buttons punched. They're blinking like crazy. Now we're supposed to go have a relationship over here and we don't have any more buttons. All the lines are used up. There's no more open lines. Plus, I don't even remember which line went to which anymore. And so I shut down. The relationship shut down. Now the way to deal with that is that I have to hit the button, pick up the phone, and finish the thing, you know, whatever that means, finish it, so that when I hang up the phone, that line is open. And I have to do that with all those kinds of things, you see. But that is really messy. It looks really unspiritual to do that. And we kind of have this naive view of God, you know, who's not okay with our pain and who's not okay with our emotions, and even more naive with the fact that we think that as long as he can't see them, he doesn't know they're there. And that's just not true. And we get stuck with a lot of them, and we've got all that weight now, and we're supposed to live, and we can't live. That's what depression is. But in this process, it's just a normal thing. If the person is depressed in this process, it will go away after it accomplishes what it's supposed to accomplish. If a person is depressed because of school, because they were burned out from school, burned out from a relationship, burned out from the holidays, burned out from whatever, and they go into a depression, it will lift. After it's accomplished what it's there to accomplish, which is to replenish your resources and get your adrenaline all back or however you want to say it. For some people, in some areas, with some issues, it doesn't pass. They just keep getting worse and worse and worse. At that point, it's time to get help. It's time to intervene and do something with that kind of depression. But I think that mostly the reason why that kind of depression happens where it kind of spirals and keeps spiraling downward is because the person hasn't had permission and doesn't have a lot of skills to start going out here with it, and they just keep doing it in here. And they're so indicted for being depressed that that just adds to depression, and at that point it's time to intervene and say, we need to get this person to someone who can help them. But most often what I see with the kind of depression I'm talking about is it just lifts. And a lot of times it just descends. And it's hard to even point at the thing that started it. It's like, here I am. I'm stuck. What happened? You can't even find the event. Well, with this, you can't. When you're going through the grief kind of process, you usually do have something that you can point at. It's an automatic shutdown. Okay, depression works. That sounds so strange, but depression works. It does what it's there to do, which is to get you rested back up and put back together again. If it's not working, it's time to get some help and get unstuck. Sometimes people get stuck. I'll give you a couple examples of stuck in a little bit. The last stage is the acceptance stage. Now, acceptance, before I even get into acceptance, well, okay, I'll get into it. Acceptance does not mean not noticing. Okay? You know, like we've been kind of taught as Christians to accept people the way they are, and what that kind of has meant is ignore the way they are. Okay? Acceptance doesn't mean ignore the way people are. It means accept the way they are. Okay? This is really the way they are. It really is. Look, here it is. This is it. It isn't pretend they're not the way they are and call it acceptance. It's not not noticed the way they are. It's not the get happy, don't worry, be happy stage, okay, of losing a loved one. What's so weird about this, and I realized this, what I'm going to tell you right now, it just popped into my head when Dave was opening up the deal. What's so weird about this and why I think we have such a problem with this in the Christian church is that these stages that people go through, at least three of them, anger and blaming and depression, we're just not okay with at all. It's like when you do that in front of people, people just aren't okay with that. They do Bible verses on you. They send you to people. They get people to come and talk to you, all kinds of stuff. The only stages that we're okay with as Christians, what I've seen is the denial stage, which is really weird, okay? Because I think that as Christians, we should be the best able to be talking about what's real. And the acceptance stage, except our definition of acceptance is wacky. Because acceptance does not mean ignoring what's there. It means accepting what's there. This is really what's there. And so because we have this approach to these kinds of things, I just think that there's an incredible amount of people who get stuck in the grief process. They never go through the whole thing and come out the other end finished. Finished does not mean happy about this. It does not mean unaffected by this. Acceptance means this really happened. When my father died, when I got to acceptance about my father, it didn't mean I'm okay with the fact that he died. I'm not okay. I hate it. I wish he never would have done it. It doesn't mean I'm happy about it. It doesn't mean I'm unaffected by it. I've finally gotten to the place where I'm no longer affected by the fact that my father died. That's not acceptance. Acceptance is, he really did die. It really does stink. I really am sad. I really hate that that happened, but it doesn't interrupt my life. I can still go through my life feeling all the feelings now that are about that kind of loss. In a denial stage, I couldn't, I was not capable. I wasn't in the process where I was able to bear the heaviness of all of the feelings it is to feel when your father dies. Now I am. but that doesn't mean I'm not sad. It means I'm as sad as I am. I'm as sad about it as I could be. I'm as sad as I could be. But it doesn't interrupt my life. We have a friend who one day, he was in an acting group in Colorado, and he was staying with some people, and their little girl, their little two-year-old girl, was playing in the driveway on one of those little Hot Wheels or a little tricycle, and he was in a pickup truck. He backed over the little girl, okay? And he heard some kind of noise, so he went forward again and ran over again and then looked out the door, and there she was, and he freaked out and ran down the road, and he was a mess. And, you know, that's normal. It's okay to be a mess when you do that, okay? It's okay to be sad when your dad dies. But about a year later, we saw him. And we said, how are you doing with that? What's all going on with that? He says, I'm doing great. It's like it never happened. That is not acceptance. Acceptance is, that's denial. Denial is like it never happened. Acceptance is, it really did, this really is a true thing. And you can even let that in, and it doesn't interrupt your life. And it doesn't interrupt your relationships. It doesn't control, you know, how you're doing. but it's not that you're unaffected by it. You're affected by it, but it doesn't control your life. It doesn't interrupt it. Funerals are for the living and funerals are to help people with this stage. Now, you know, most people who go to funerals on the third day after the person dies are kind of in this denial stage. I don't know, you've been to a funeral of someone that you care about. You feel kind of numb. You kind of feel like you're in this surrealistic place, and the curtains are kind of, it feels gray. It just feels like there's this filter over everything. But the reason why you do funerals with the body there, which I think is terrible. I mean, we went to a thing the other week, two weeks ago, to go see the body, and I said to my wife, you know, when I die, don't do this. Don't do this. This is goofy. It's a dead guy, okay? And I'm not here. I'm not here. I'm someplace else. What are you going to go show Jeff that's not here? But see, that was just mostly I was saying that because I just didn't want to go that night. I didn't want to do something else. But the truth is that the reason why you go and see the body is it's kind of like, get it. See this? This is really true. And that's a really valuable piece in terms of people's grief process. It might not sink in right then, but people need to see. They need to go and experience. This is official. This is a loss. It's a settled thing. And, you know, the happiness about resurrection and going to heaven and all that kind of stuff is even more happy when we know how sad the sadness is. It's even more happy. But sometimes we even use that to keep people from the acceptance stage and keep them in denial. And kind of expect some kind of unhuman or inhuman response to the person's experience of having someone really important to them wrenched out of their life, which is okay to feel sad. So anyway, those are the kind of stages that people go through. Now, any kind of loss can put someone in a grief process. the loss of a relationship. If you had a relationship with someone, they don't have to die, you just have to not have a relationship with them anymore, and you can feel some of these things, experience some of these things about that. Loss of a job. People grieve over the loss of a job. They enter into these stages. Now, sometimes if the loss isn't as severe, they go through stages faster. But it's normal to grieve any kind of loss. People grieve any kind of equity that they have. Now, what that means is this, that if you're in a process, we'll use a job, okay? If you're in the process of a job, and here's the starting point, and you've invested five years in this job, this would be five years, okay? And now you're saying to yourself, I hate this job. This job isn't working. This stinks. It's terrible. I don't like being here. I don't want this job. For me to just let that go, I would grieve that. That would be a loss for me because it would mean a lot of things. It would mean that all my energy and efforts and relationships and friends and people and time is gone. It's not there anymore. What a lot of people do, what some people do to avoid grieving the loss is they say, well, this job really stinks, so I'll give it six more months. and if it doesn't improve after six more months, then I'm going to quit this job. So now they've got five and a half years. Well, see, the truth is that it's harder to let go of five and a half years than it is to let go of five years. It's worse grief now, because now if you leave, you've lost more equity, so it's easier to invest a little bit more equity than it is to have to go through the grief of losing all the equity that you've already invested. This happens in relationships. I have counseled people who have gotten married to rescue four years of lousy dating relationships, you know, because this was terrible, this is awful, but if I say goodbye, this is it, it's over, this didn't work. It's like saying I've wasted four years. It's easier to invest a little bit more in the relationship to try to rescue it and turn it into something good than it is to say that's gone, because if I say that's gone, I have to go through this. And this isn't any fun. This is painful. But it also is very normal. Sometimes people have to grieve a dream, like something that they thought they were going to have or they really wanted to get next year or five years from now or when they were a kid, something they looked forward to, and now they're an adult and it just isn't going to happen. And they go through a grief process. It's kind of funny, but when my father died, I grieved my father, but I also grieved my youth because I felt like I'm an official adult now. It's like I've entered a new era, and this is over. And now I've got to deal with it. So I grieved lots of things with that. It wasn't just his death. People who grew up in alcoholic families are going to, as adults, grieve what they didn't get as kids. And if they don't know they're in a grief process, they get stuck in the process. People who have miscarriages or abortions are going to grieve. But see, then they're going to say this doesn't make any sense because this wasn't an official person, so I shouldn't be grieving, but yet they are, and it's really confusing, and they get stuck. The point is that the process of grief is really a valuable process and it's important to go through and we need to go through it. And when we're with someone who's going through it, they don't need us to put them on a schedule with it or control their grief process. They just need us to be with them in the process. Thank you. Okay. What do we do now? Do you have any questions about this? Dave's going to come back and do some stuff on Job. I have a question. Back to anger, is it okay to teach kids to physically express their anger or just say it's okay for you to be angry but you can't destroy a toy? Yeah, I don't think it's okay to let people be destructive with their anger. When I worked in the treatment center, I would have people who would come from other programs and stuff, and they had learned to hit pillows. It's like hitting a pillow beats hitting a person, I suppose. It does. But I usually wouldn't let them hit pillows because people already knew how to hit stuff when they were angry. What they didn't know how to do was talk to somebody when they were angry. And part of the thing with anger is that we have a message in our growing up that you can't be angry with someone and love them both at the same time, and I think you can. being angry with someone doesn't mean you don't love them and I think it is possible to do your anger straight and non-destructive so are we in a different tape now? I'm going to keep going I have some other examples here just an illustration of when I grieved my dad when I grieved my dad he was sick for a year, I knew about it, I knew he was dying it was really strange because I went to see him the week before he died I decided I better go see him and I called him on the phone and I said I need to come see you and he said oh you don't need to do that and he kind of martyred that no don't go through all the hassle and I said I'm not coming for you I'm coming for me I said I feel like I don't know you it seems to me like I spent my whole life either trying to get you to approve of me or pushing you away and get you off my case like this kind of thing and I don't know you and we never had that much of a relationship and we got some things to settle and I'm coming so I went there and we basically duked it out together in the hospital room on the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday before he died and see I knew all this stuff and it didn't help me because I kept trying to do it right. I kept trying. I should be past this stage by now. It's like I'm not giving you this to put you on a schedule or to give you a formula. All this is is what people have observed others who go through grief. This is just an observation. It's what it looks like. And the reason we do this piece during this whole thing on despair and Job and grieving stuff is just to say that if you're experiencing this, you're not crazy, you're okay. It's okay. This is normal. It's okay to go through this. It kind of redefines what the goal is, though. The goal is not to not have this. The goal is to have this. And to be in a safe place where you're allowed to have it. So I kept trying to do grief right and all this kind of stuff. But one of the things that happened with me, and I'm going to talk more about grief in the next session, my own grief with this because I really got depressed. And I'll tell you about what that was like. Because I got stuck. I was trying to do this so right I got stuck. But anyway, one of the things that happened would be people would come up to me and they would think, it's like you think that when a person is in this, something's wrong with them. See, when someone's going through this, nothing's wrong with them. This is what you're supposed to go through when you have a loss or whatever. And it doesn't, you know, I've made it about death. It doesn't have to be about death. It can be about any kind of thing. Lots of people have grown up in families where it wasn't okay to be kids, and all the kids had to act like miniature adults, and you have to grieve your childhood. You had your childhood ripped off of you. And you're going to go through this kind of stuff. And you won't be able to talk yourself out of it because if you talk yourself out of it, you'll just get stuck in anger and depression and things like that. But people would come up and try to fix me, and I wasn't broken. Not like broken in the positive sense we talk about here a lot where you're at the end of yourself. I mean broken like something fell on the floor and broke into pieces. People were treating me like I was broken all into pieces, and now they're all trying to glue me back together again, like Humpty Dumpty or something like that. So they'd say really stupid things. But they had good intentions. it just didn't help. They'd say, well, at least he's better off than he was before. It's true, he is. He was a mess. He's lots better off than he was before. Well, at least you had a good last year. It's true, we did have a good last year. We had a really good last year in terms of the whole context of our relationship. And we even had as much of a good last week in terms of the last year as we had a good last year in terms of all the years. It was great. That's true, but so what? I'm sad. See, what those things are saying are don't be as sad as you are. Well, at least you got to talk things through. Yeah. Well, at least he's not in pain anymore. Yeah. Well, at least he didn't waste away to nothing like lots of cancer patients. Yeah. Great. I'm thankful for that. I'm grateful for that. But so what? What does that mean for me? See, what I heard it mean is, don't be sad. And it was okay to be sad when your dad dies. So what would happen is I would see people coming and I'd go, oh man, they're going to ask me how I'm doing. If I say how I'm doing, they're going to try to fix me. And I just don't even want to do that. So then they'd say, how are you doing? And I'd say, fine. because then they couldn't fix me because I was fixed already. But that wasn't true, and that doesn't help, or else I'd hide. You know, I'd go the other way, I'd go, oh boy, and I'd go the other way, you know, and it doesn't help. Now, one of the things that my wife did is that she told me that no matter how low I go, no matter how sad I get, no matter how bad it gets, she won't go away. and she said that lots of times in a lot of different ways. She'd see me being sad and she'd say, look, it's okay, no matter how low you go, I won't go away. You know what that did? It gave me permission to be as low as I was and you know what that did? It let me go through the process and come out the other side. Now it was a real gift to me and there were other people who did that too but the solution to not feeling this way is to finish feeling this way. It's not to try not to feel this way. I have people come in my office and they start crying. It's like a little timer goes off and they go, okay, that's enough. And they go, okay. And then they go, I don't know why I always do that. I'm always doing that. Well, the reason they're always doing that is they never finish. They always just cry until there's some rule about how long it is okay to cry. Then they stop crying. And then they wonder why they always have this crying in them. It's because they never finish and let it all out. and the way to not be in this anymore is to finish being in this is to go through it and my wife gave me permission to do that as did some other people here's an interesting thing that happened quite some time afterwards my daughter Erin was probably the one person in the relationship with my father, her grandfather that was the tensest out of all the relationships of my daughters with my father. That was the tensest one, most tense one. And when my father died, the way that Kara, my oldest daughter, processes things is she's pretty intellectual. She kind of just figures it out. And she said, well, we're going to see him again, right? Yeah, okay. And she went through some grief. She kind of started here. She kind of figured it out a little bit and got up in her head. She experienced some of this later on when we went to his house and things like that, but she kind of started here. Jessie was so little, she didn't get it. So she was like, she comes in and I've got to tell her now that Grandpa died and she's just kind of picking her nose and goes, can I go play now? Okay. So she goes, no. It's okay. But Aaron was really sad and really down and really depressed and really crying and all that kind of stuff. And it lasted and lasted and lasted and lasted and lasted. And so we had had her tested one time for some school stuff, and we kind of had a relationship with the counselor that tested her. So we called her up on the phone at Washburn Child Guidance Center. We called her up and said, you know, let's bounce this off you and see what you think. So we told her what happened, and we told her what was going on with Erin. And she said, well, how is Erin's relationship with your dad? and we said it was really tense. And she said, well, you know what happens sometimes is that when you have a relationship like that that's really tense, what the little kid's way of dealing with it is, in terms of while Grandpa's still alive, this grumpy old guy, is that she just wishes he'd go away. And he did. And maybe she's feeling like she caused it. So we went and talked to Aaron, and we said, Aaron, you know, Grandpa died of cancer. and we were just wondering if you were feeling like maybe it was your fault that he died and she broke down and started, she thought out right now. She was so stuck and frozen in this and as soon as we gave her permission and kind of sorted it out she just thought out right now and we told her it wasn't your fault and your sadness with how grandpa acted was normal for someone who's acting like that and it's okay and you don't have the power to make him disappear and just like we didn't have the power to make him stay, and it's okay. And she finished the grief process, but she was stuck. Two more things. Well, actually, it's one more thing. It happened twice, and I forgot it the second time. I'm doing a book for Bethany on shame. It should be out this summer. And when I got the contract, this was like last summer, so this was the summer of 88. My dad was dead for six years. What happened was that I got the contract, heard on the phone, I got the contract. So I called my wife and told her, and she went hooray. And I called some other people that were kind of rooting for me and keeping up on the process. I called Dave. I called my grandmother. I called my mother. I called these people, you know, telling them that finally I got the contract because I've been waiting for so long. Then I walked around the house for like two or three days wishing I could call somebody. I wish I could call. Isn't there anybody else I can call? You know, it's like, you know, I mean, if I would have called you guys, you'd have gone, why is this guy calling me? I mean, but I felt like, you know, I'd walk by the phone and I'd go, boy, wouldn't it be neat to be able to call someone, but I couldn't figure out what that was about. And all of a sudden, I was in my office one day at home, and all of a sudden I figured out what it was about. It was about my dad. So he was the only person I didn't tell. I just broke down, crying like crazy, you know, six years later. Went in the family room, said to Holly, I figured it out. She said it was about your dad. I said yeah how did you know that she said because you did it last time with the other book I said I did she said yeah so she just hugged me I just finished crying and that was that how should you feel when you miss your dad like you miss your dad it's okay she didn't say well it's been six years I mean come on see what I would do with that is I would just stuff it I would just progress mass it I would just stuff it, seethe it, whatever you want to call it, put it on the surface and act as if I didn't have it when I really did have it and set myself up for some depression when that's not necessary because you can just go through the process. So once again, I just want to say that the reason we do this is just to tell you that it's normal and it's not to put you on a schedule. I'll tell you where a schedule gets you in a couple weeks. Just to say you're not crazy, it's normal, and if you have a loss, you're probably feeling the way you should be feeling for having that loss. And so now Dave is going to come up and put this in the context of Job, and we're going to finish the session about Job, and I'm going to come back in a couple weeks in terms of talking about how to help people as helpers for those who are in despair. now that we can understand this a little bit better. So why don't you come on up and close this up. Open your Bibles to Job. chapter 1. And all I want to do tonight as we close is introduce you to him. Job was a person who, as most of you know, had a time in his life where he had enormous amounts of pain. And when it came, he thrashed. It is a passage of scripture that we are familiar with. Most of us are familiar with Job at the very beginning and at the very end. We're familiar with the beginning where he responds very appropriately. We're real pleased with how he responds. I'm going to read that in just a minute. And we're real pleased with the end because he kind of has a reconciliation and there's an intimacy with God that's established that he didn't know before. But we know a little bit about the middle where he goes through very much of this. And when he's going through this, he doesn't look real good. There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. And that man was blameless, upright, fearing God, and turning away from evil. And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. And his possessions also were 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and very many servants. And that man was the greatest of all men in the east. And his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. And it came about when the days of feasting had completed their cycle, that Job would send and consecrate them, rising up early in the morning and offering burnt offerings, according to the number of them all. For Job said, Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. Thus Job continually did that. Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them. And we have a lot of trouble with this part here. We'll deal with this. And the Lord said to Satan, From where do you come? Then Satan answered the Lord and said, From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it. And the Lord said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him on earth. It's almost as if God is baiting Satan. A blameless and upright man fearing God and turning away from evil. Then Satan answered the Lord, Does Job fear God for nothing? The meaning there is the reason he fears you or serves you is because you've given him everything you ever wanted. Hast thou not made a hedge about him and his house and all that he has on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse you to your face. Then the Lord said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your power. Don't put your hand on him, however. So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord, and this is the cataloging of what happened to Job. Now it happened on the day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, that a messenger came to Job and said, The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them. The Sabians attacked and took them. They also slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you. While he was still speaking, another also came and said, The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you. And while he was still speaking, another also came and said, The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them and slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you. While he was still speaking, another also came and gave him the hardest news of all. Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house. It fell upon the young people, and they all died, and I alone have escaped to tell you. His family is dead. His possessions are gone. All of his status has been erased. And then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head, fell down on the ground and worshipped God. And he said these famous words, Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I shall return there. The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Through all this, Job did not sin, nor did he blame God. That's the response that we're real comfortable with. That's great. If I was dealing with Job and I was kind of one of the people who brought the information about his children dying, or I was the pastor or the friend who kind of made the visit and had to give them the information, and the person I was dealing with gave this response, boy, would that make my work easy. Wouldn't that be great? He's dealing with it really well. And that would be the report we would give. How's Job doing? He's doing great. Listen, he said naked. I mean, he just accepted it. Naked I came. Naked I'm going to go. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Isn't that great? Might there be another explanation for this response other than him being super spiritual? Might there be another explanation? Maybe Job is just totally connected right now. It's just great. What a guy. Maybe he's going through this. Maybe he has not at all connected with what's going on. That's one of the possibilities. Does it sound like that at all? Maybe it does. Maybe it doesn't. I think when we see this drama unfold, we're going to find out that there might be another possibility for this wonderful response that makes us all feel real comfortable, and that is that part of it, I think, is denial. Another thing is that he might even be bargaining already. What do you mean by that? What I mean by that is this. Job had a grid through which he observed truth, through which he figured out life, and that is this. If you do good, God rewards you. If you do bad and you goof up, God's going to punish you. And the sign that you're doing good is that you get all these goodies. The sign that you must be doing bad is that bad things happen. One of the signs to Job that he was doing it right was that he had 500 yoke, he had 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, and everybody was happy. One of the bargaining things I think he might be doing with this right response is if I just respond right, he'll make it all go away. Have you ever done that? The response was not really right from the heart. it wasn't the way you really, really felt, but out of fear and out of anguish, you just figure out what's the right Christian response so he makes the pain go away. But it got worse. Down in verse 4, Satan answered the Lord and said, skin for skin, let me touch his body, and he won't sound near spiritual. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. However, put forth thy hand now and touch his bone and his flesh. He will curse you to your face. So the Lord said to Satan, Behold, he is in your power. Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. And he took a potsherd to scrape himself while he was sitting among the ashes. His wife said to him, Do you still hold fast to your integrity? he cursed God and died, but he said, you speak as one of the foolish women. Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity? In all of this, Job did not sin. Now I'll move to chapter 3, verse 1. But afterward, and we'll discuss what the afterward was after next week. Afterward, Job opened his mouth and didn't sound real spiritual anymore. He cursed the day of his birth. And Job said, let the day perish on which I was born. And the night which said, a boy is conceived. May that day be darkness. Let not God above care for it, nor light shine on it. And thus begins the grieving process of Job. We're going to move into it next week. Let's pray as we're dismissed. Fathers, we go through these next six weeks, there may be some here right now who are in the middle of some very confusing and painful situations, and God, we pray your spirit would just minister to them your freedom and your grace and your presence. God, there are things that we don't know are ahead of us. In the next six weeks, there might be some things that come into our lives that will make us desperately cling to some of the truth we're going to discover here. And Father, we just again pray your anointing would be upon us, that it would be used by your Spirit to build the body here. And we pray it in Jesus' name. Amen.
