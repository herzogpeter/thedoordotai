You don't want to come to the 4 o'clock with all the crowds. So here you are. Welcome. Whether you haven't been in a church for years and years or whether this is kind of your normal place to be, we really want to say welcome. Welcome to Open Door. And we've been walking through the four weeks of Advent and we've lit the candles of hope and love and peace and joy. and tonight we get to light the long-awaited Christ candle. And I think it's very fitting that Advent would happen during winter in Minnesota. Because as you're maybe shoveling today, wondering when you'll ever see grass again, it's just a little reminder that all is not as it should be. and we wait and we hope and we long for Jesus to come and set things right again. And so tonight we light the Christ candle as we hope and wait and expect Jesus to come again. Before we move on in the service, a couple of announcements. One is that there is no Saturday night service this weekend. There is two Sunday morning services at 9 and 11, but there's no Saturday night service. So just wanted to let you know that. Now as we move on, please read this reading with me. The people walking in darkness have seen a great light. On those living in the land of deep darkness, a light has dawned. For unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given. and the government will be on his shoulders and he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. And if I say, surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me, even the darkness will not be dark to you. The night will shine like the day for the darkness is as light to you. O come, O come, Emmanuel And ransom captive Israel That mourns in lonely exile here Until the Son of God appears Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel Shall come to thee, O Israel O come, thou day's spring, come and cheer Our spirits by thine advent here Disperse the gloomy clouds of night And death's dark shadows pour to flight Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel Shall come to thee, O Israel O come, desire of nations, find All peoples in one heart and mind Bid thou our sad division cease And be thyself our King of Peace Rejoice, rejoice Emmanuel Shall come to thee, O Israel Rejoice, rejoice Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel. Well, there's a prayer that we pray around Advent, traditional Advent prayer, and that is, Come, Lord Jesus. Let's say that together. Come, Lord Jesus. And as you think about it, it's a little bit of an odd prayer that we pray. Because on Christmas, we celebrate the fact that Jesus came, right? Yes. Are you with me? One of you are. No, we celebrate that Jesus came as a baby. You know, lying in a manger wrapped in swaddling clothes. No crib for a bed. That's what we celebrate. We celebrate the fact that Jesus came 2,000 years ago. But still we pray, come Lord Jesus. So the question has to be raised, why do we do that? Well, my little three and a half year old son, Isaac, most mornings he wakes up after the sun has already risen. He's kind of a late sleeper. And so yesterday morning he woke up around 6 a.m. I think he was preparing for Christmas Day, perhaps. But he woke up around 6 a.m. and it was still dark outside. And so as we're going down the steps to downstairs, there's a big window. And he said, Daddy, it's dark outside. And I think that's why we pray, come Lord Jesus at Advent. Because if we're honest, it's dark outside. It's dark in our world. It's dark for some of us in our situations. I remember for years, my wife Mary and I struggled with infertility. and so we would come to the Christmas Eve service and many times, though not tonight, there's pictures of babies that'll flash up on the screens, you know, on videos and different things like that and it's to help us connect to the humanity of this baby child Jesus. But for us, for years and years and years, to see pictures of babies on Christmas Eve was just a painful reminder that it was dark outside. And for those of you who are struggling with that, maybe this time of year where so much focus is given on a baby. Even if it's Jesus, it's a dark time. And so the Advent prayer is your prayer. We pray together again, come Lord Jesus. Maybe this Christmas it's dark for you because it's the first Christmas you're celebrating without her or without him. And so all of your Christmas preparations have felt sort of strained and different. Every single one of them you've tried to get into it, but if you're honest, it's hard because everything reminds you of him or her, and it's dark outside, and so we pray, come, Lord Jesus. Maybe some of you kind of wandered in here, and if you're honest, you came in here with many more questions than you have answers. That there's so much about faith in God that you don't understand, can't understand, maybe don't even want to understand, but there's many, many parts of you that if you had, you know, a little bit of time with God, your primary question would be why. And so to you, it's dark outside and we pray, come Lord Jesus. Maybe for most of us, just the daily pressures of everyday life has you feeling that it is dark. And so we need Jesus to come into our dark places. Well, in the book of Isaiah, years and years and years before Jesus came, these incredible words were written as a form of prophecy for when Jesus would come. And we read this. For the people walking in darkness saw a great light. the people living in deep darkness the light had finally dawned. There's a picture of when Jesus would come but that was hundreds of years before Jesus came and so for hundreds of years people would walk around in the dark saying Lord when are you coming? And then you know we read in Luke chapter 2 about these group of shepherds that were living in their fields, keeping watch over, obviously, their sheep, right? And to get a picture of this, you need to know that these shepherds were probably teenage guys huddled around a little campfire, trying to keep warm with what meager clothes that they had, and they were probably doing what teenage guys do around a fire. That's exactly it. They were telling crude jokes. They were making even cruder noises and sounds. They were shepherds in their field drinking coffee, hoping the sheep were going to stay inside of their line of sight. But all of a sudden, out of nowhere, blinding light fills their viewpoints. And they're looking inside the cup in which they were drinking, thinking, I thought it was just coffee. Maybe someone slipped me something. It was wild and crazy. And so the first thing that these angels said to them was, listen, you guys, don't be afraid, for I bring you tidings of great joy, which shall be for all people. Because on this day is born a Savior. And that Savior will bring peace on earth, upon whom his favor rests. So that was the first thing that they told him. But the second thing that the angels told these little shepherds, these teenage guys was they gave him directions to find this baby. And what's interesting, number one, is that of all the people that God could have chosen to give this birth announcement to for the very first time, it's so interesting that he picks these teenage shepherds. I love this. It kind of says from the very beginning, this is who I'm going for. But number two, it's really interesting that he gives them an invite to go face to face with Jesus and Mary and Joseph way before the wise men ever got there. Here was these teenage shepherds huddled around this manger and you've got to know this scene was awkward because we all know how teenage boys are around babies, right? They don't know what to do. They don't know what to, oh, hey, you know, and there's Mary there and you just had a baby. I don't know what to do with that. And did you bring a gift? No, I didn't bring a gift. Did you know I didn't bring a gift? We should have stopped by Target on the way. And all this stuff was happening to these little shepherds. We don't know what was said. We don't know if any gifts were given. What we do know is they were so blown away by what they saw and what they heard from the angels that it says that they went out and spread the word to everyone. Now, these were shepherds, remember? You've got to wonder where did they go to spread the word. They were shepherds. I think they went to the tavern. They went to their friends that were maybe huddled around other campfires in their fields. They went to the lowly people, the normal people who were huddled around their own campfires, hunkering down, expecting the worst, muttering the prayer, Lord, when are you going to come? And they got to tell them, listen, you guys, there is good news for all people. We've been walking in darkness for so long, but the darkness is ending. I have seen a great light. And like popcorn popping up all over, the news of this Savior was spreading like wildfire. For those of you who have been walking in darkness, a great light has dawned. And the good news for us in 2010, no matter what your darkness is right now, whether it's infertility or the loss of a loved one or the loss of a job or the loss of something that you once held dear or your painful questions that have no answers, The good news for you as you're walking around in darkness is the light has come and will come again. And when it says that they'll bring peace, that he'll bring peace to the earth, what it means is he's gonna set things right finally again. When Jesus comes again, he will set things right. He will make things right. because the good news is found in the scriptures. In Isaiah 9, 6, we read this. For unto us a child is born, unto us a son has been given, and the government will be on his shoulders, and he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. But then it gets real personal in Psalm 139 when we read these words. Even if you say, surely the darkness will hide me, surely I will get lost in my darkness. And even if the light becomes night around you, even if daylight seems as night to you, even if you're in the darkest of places right now, here's the good news, even the dark is not dark to God. The night will shine like the day for even the darkness is as light to God. And then in John 1, we read that in this child that was born, in this child was life and that life was the light of all people and the light shined in the darkness and the darkness, listen you guys, has not overcome it even now. The light of the world has come for the world and will make things right again, amen? And that is what we celebrate when we light that Christ candle. Feeble as it looks, It is the light of the world. And it is enough. And the darkness will not overcome it. Merry Christmas. Let's pray together. Now, Jesus, all of us have darkness. And into each one of our darkness, individually, we ask that your light would come. and bring hope and joy and love and peace and that you would dispel the darkness around us and bring the light of hope. And that you would do that in a very personal way for each one of us who are struggling in darkness this season. That you would come and you would be the light of the world even now so that those of us who are walking in darkness will see a great light. Amen. Thank you.
