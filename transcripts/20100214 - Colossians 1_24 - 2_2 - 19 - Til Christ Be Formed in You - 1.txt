Well, Apostle Paul, at the end of his letter to the Ephesians, was sharing with them some prayer requests, some things he was asking them to pray for him about. And one of them was this, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth that I might make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel. And as we now come back to our study in the book of Colossians, that's my request as well, Colossians 1.26, Paul calls it again the mystery. Hidden from past ages and generations, but now this mystery has been revealed to the saints, and the mystery is this. We've been talking about this for three weeks now. Steve began it a couple weeks ago. Christ in you. That's the mystery, and it's also the hope of glory. The prophets spoke of it. They longed for it. Ezekiel, in particular, described it in Ezekiel 36, verse 26, as a time when God would give to his people a new heart and put within them a new spirit, and I will remove the heart of stone, he says, from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you and cause you by that internal spirit to walk in my statutes, and you will be careful to observe my ordinances, not because of some external pressure from the outside, like the law, to obey, to get you to obey, But because now, because of an internal working of God's Spirit to transform by means of a new heart, a new spirit which brings with it, when you have that inside of you, it brings with it a new desire to obey the word and will of God. Christ in you is the hope or the source of that kind of glory, of that kind of life, where people are being transformed from the inside out. And so, because of all that, we proclaim him. And now we're into the text of the morning, Colossians 1.28. We proclaim him, admonishing everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom in order that we may present everyone complete. The NIV says perfect. Some of your Bibles, if you're reading along, say to present everyone perfect. Pretty intimidating word. And it means mature, complete, fully formed. Indeed, to this end of bringing people to maturity, to being fully formed in Christ, I labor, Paul says, striving according to the power that God gives me, which so mightily works within me. Chapter 2, verse 1, which I want you to notice for a couple reasons. One is we're going to chapter 2. This is unbelievable. We started at Colossians in September. I looked it up six months ago. Six months, one chapter. Pretty good, Steve. For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf, and for those who are at latency, and for all those who have not personally seen my face, and this is what I struggle for, that your hearts would be encouraged, having been knit together in love, in order that we may all be in the process of attaining all the wealth that comes from the full assurance resulting in the true knowledge of God's mystery that is, and I was going to repeat himself, here's the mystery, and this is the fullness of what we want to attain to, if you will, Christ himself. And this is almost like a parenthesis around here. Christ himself, who by the way, in whom by the way, are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, that Christ, that presence, those resources in you. Sum up that whole text this way. My desire for you is what Paul is saying. My dream for you is that you would come to fully know who you fully are in Christ and to have Christ who is in you be fully formed in you in order to present you complete, perfect, mature, fully formed, all of which is a pretty tall order, don't you think? I mean, think about it. Not only to be fully formed yourself, because that was Paul's passion for his own life, to press on to the upward call of God in Christ, to be fully formed yourself, to be complete and mature, but to bring people with you is a pretty big deal. And the first question that occurs to me around that is this, how? How does that happen? Well, Paul says, here's how, verse 28, and this is not the exhaustive answer, but one of the things that's really incredibly important in this process, here's how we proclaim him. And by the way, that doesn't just mean preach. We make Jesus known in a variety of ways. Then adding this, admonishing everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom in order that we may present everyone perfect, complete, lacking nothing, mature, fully formed, which raises another question. At least it does for me. And I think this question's a bit more complex. The second question is this. What kind of person can do that well? What kind of person can make Christ known, can in fact admonish when it's necessary, and teach effectively, and to do it in such a way that it really does help people come into the fullness of who they are in Christ? Because some of you are thinking when I talk like this, not me. I mean, I could never do that. I'm not smart enough. I'm not holy enough. I mean, I'm glad there's people like the Apostle Paul because I certainly don't know how to do something like that. I don't know enough. I'm not formed enough to do this kind of stuff effectively. That's for superstars like the Apostle Paul. While others of you may be thinking, no, it's not for superstars because I can do this. This I love. I absolutely love admonishing people. In fact, it's my spiritual gift. In fact, if people, I'm telling you, if people would just listen to me when I correct them, this place would be a lot better off. Just a little side note here. You are who we are afraid of. So let me ask that question a slightly different way. What kind of person would we need to be to do that well? To proclaim and admonish and to teach with all wisdom, And to do it in such a way that it really does help people discover who they are in Christ, resulting in the true knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ in them, fully formed in them. And I'm talking to dads about that. This isn't just for the Apostle Paul. It's so important that you disconnect from that. What kind of dad would I need to be in the raising of my sons, in the raising of my daughters? What kind of mom? What kind of husband? would I need to be? What kind of wife? What kind of friend? You know, I was thinking about this a lot this last week in light of our mentoring program. Just this really important thing that we are attempting to do with the next generation. And all of our mentors and our mentor coordinators and hundreds of people who are involved in that whole thing. There's a really important question. What kind of mentor would I need to be? What kind of mentor coordinator would I need to be? What kind of people can do this well? Proclaim, admonish, and teach in such a way that people actually do grow, come into the fullness of who they are in Christ. And the reason, that's an important question, what kind of people can do this well, is because not everybody does do this well. She was the most feared person in her church. a master at guilt and manipulation. She led a Bible study for women, and everyone was welcome to her Bible study as long as they agreed with her teaching and yielded to her admonishments. She was involved in the lives of lots of people at her church, but she didn't really love them. She wanted to control them, always needing to fix them. And this is why I'm bringing something like this up when I look at the text we're into today, this person would have almost certainly heard the words of Paul in Colossians 1, where he's talking about admonishing everyone and instructing, teaching everyone. She would have looked at those verses as a pretext for doing what she did, admonishing everyone, correcting everyone. It was her spiritual gift. At home, she called the shots. Though ironically, and this is really strange, she was really into this theological system and got real defensive about it that demanded wives submit to their husbands because the husband is the head of the church, but the way that was translated was the boss, not the head of the church, the head of the home, which was translated by her and those in her little camp as the boss. So at home, her husband was the boss, primarily because she told him he was. And heaven help him if he didn't boss the way she said he should. And what's really, really, really kind of strange, interesting, not interesting or strange if you're into it, but if you can step back and just observe it, what's strange about it is that there were actually lots of people in that church who regarded her as a spiritual giant. People looked up to her and thought, that's what it must mean to be mature in Christ, to be fully formed. And she had lots of power. And she did lots of damage. He was a Christian leader and author who viewed himself as a defender of the truth, which is something, it's good, defend the truth, really important, but he delighted in attacking and ripping apart other Christians whose doctrinal views didn't line up exactly with his. But he didn't just disagree with them, which is fine to do. I mean, it's great to disagree. there's lots of room for that he didn't just do that he had a tendency when he did disagree with someone to label them a heretic often misrepresenting their views making caricatures of other people's theological positions deliberately twisting their views to make them sound worse than they actually were so at the end of the day he actually slandered the truth in the name of defending the truth which is nice and again what's kind of strange about all that was this and a little scary too that there were lots of people who regarded him as a spiritual giant people looked up to him and thought that that's what it must mean to be mature in Christ to be fully formed in Christ and he had lots of power and he did lots of damage Dallas Willard in a talk I recently heard him give was lamenting the reality of what I'm talking about right now by wondering out loud now I'm quoting him here how many people in the world have been radically and permanently repelled from the way of Christ by Christians Christians who are angry obsessive controlling and rude but such Christians he says are everywhere and what they're missing he says and this really just sounds like vintage Dallas Willard. What they're missing is the wholesome liveliness that springs up from a balanced vitality within God's loving rule. Doesn't that sound like him? But then he concludes with this and this is where it kind of gets this twinge of this isn't a laughing matter, this is really serious. He says this, that spirituality wrongly understood or pursued and I would add admonishing, proclaiming and instructing that is wrongly understood and pursued is a major source of human misery and rebellion against God. It's a huge statement. Spirituality, wrongly understood or pursued, is a major source of human misery and rebellion against God. Because when people see that, misapplied. They're repelled by it. They walk away often with anger toward God because if that's what God's like, I want nothing to do with him. All of which brings me back to this question of the day. What kind of people would we need to be? What kind of parent? Dad or mom? Spouse? Husband or wife? What kind of friend? What kind of mentor or mentor? Coordinary. What do we need? Shut up. What do we need to be? I have Tourette's. Anyway. It gets worse. in order to effectively proclaim, admonish and instruct in such a way that it really does help people, not just control them, discover who they are in Christ, resulting in true knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ in them, fully formed in them. Well, to answer that, I like this morning to point us back to Paul, who has been saying all this stuff in Colossians 1 about becoming perfect and bringing, or mature, and bringing people along with you on that journey. I would like us this morning to consider him and to see some things about Paul that characterized him that were part of what enabled him to, I think, do this well, that is to proclaim, admonish, and teach in such a way that people actually grew under it. But the most important part of what I want to share in this is this, that we can do it too. We may not all have the teaching gift that someone like the Apostle Paul had, But what I want to talk to you about are the characteristics in his character, actually, that we actually can do. No matter how much you think you know or do not know, how far along you are on the journey of transformation you think you are or not, these things that I want us to see in Paul can actually be in us, wherever we are on our journey, and can help us effectively proclaim, admonish, instruct. I have three in all. The first is this, that Paul had a profound awareness of and respect for, indeed, I would call it a reverence for, and an abiding confidence in the work of God by means of the presence of God in the people with whom he was dealing. Now that's a mouthful, let me say it's much simpler. He preached Christ in you. In addition to preaching that, he believed Christ is in you, which has a pretty significant effect on how I treat you. And if I'm going to admonish you, how I'm going to do that? Because Christ's in you. I think Paul not only was aware of that, he had a reverence for that, which means, among other things, if you kind of dial into this, that I don't have to fix people. I can admonish them, and I can teach, and I can proclaim, and I can tell you what I see or what I think. And by the way, take this, and this is what I did by trying to talk about dads and moms and friends. Admonish, we do this with friends. If you have good friends, it's one of the things you do. You tell them what you see, and an admonishment is simply, hey, man, why are you going that way? Don't go that way, go this way. You're gonna get hurt. I'm concerned about what I see. I mean you can do that I think if I didn't have friends Who didn't have the courage To tell me what they saw They wouldn't be much use to me So we can do that But at some point When you recognize Christ in them At some point you back off When you realize and remember Christ is in them And I trust the Christ in them To call and convict and grow and form And to turn them and to mature them So I don't need to nag them and I'm sure it's not my job to fix them. Tell them the truth, absolutely. Now Paul, where are you getting all this? Paul said it this way. In Philippians 1 verse 6. For I am confident of this very thing. That he, that is God, who began a good work in you, that is Christ in you, will what? Perfect it. There's that word. Colossians, I want to present everyone to God. Perfect, complete. And then he says, and he says, I labor and I strive to do that stuff, which sounds like he's doing it all. It's like, I'm responsible. No, I'm not, says Paul in Philippians 1.6. Same guy, he had a balance. He didn't say all these things in the same place. I'm not responsible entirely for that. Where my confidence is in you coming into the fullness of Christ, I will tell you what I think, but my confidence is Christ in you. You know, I had a guy, I had this weird memory I had. I was in college. and I went to college up here in Minnesota. I lived in Chicago and I was home on a break and I was on this long run this one day and I was kind of coming around this one street and a guy who was kind of a leader in my dad's church pulled up in his car right next to me and I was jogging and looking really sweaty and we just started talking. How you doing, Dave? And I was telling about some things I was scared of and life and where I was going and I wasn't sure of this and that and I remember, it's weird that I remember this, but he looked me right in the eye and he says, I am confident of this very thing, that God who began a good work in you, you big idiot, will continue it. What impact? I remember it. He believed in me. That felt good. But more than that, he believed in Christ, the Christ in me. And not only that, it made me know he thinks Christ is in me. Again that word perfect here Matures the same word he uses in Colossians 1 When he says I really desire to labor and strive to bring People to this but my confidence in that happening is in God who I believe Is in you so I don't have to nag you or pressure you Or try to fix you question Have you ever been in a relationship Where after a while you begin to feel I'm their project. I'm a project for them. Like one of their primary functions in life as it relates to you is to fix you. So they proclaim and they admonish and they instruct and you despise it. In fact, with all of their admonishments that might even be right and good and true they're having the opposite effect because you want to just run the other way, be the opposite kind of person because of how they're doing it. Again, when I was in college, I had a friend who, for whatever reason, took it upon himself to disciple me. And I bought into it for a while because I really liked this guy. I admired him a lot. And he seemed to have a lot going on. And so I kind of submitted to that and I kind of wanted his approval. And so when he brought his little admonishment, I would kind of go along with it for a while. But after a while, about five minutes, he was driving me nuts. He was always right. He always knew. Finally, it kind of came to a head. We had a big fight. I hit him in the mouth, and we became really good friends. None of which is true. And I don't recommend that. The fight might be necessary. You ever feel that stuff? C.S. Lewis in his book The Great Divorce Great scene and just to set it up this part is where there's a tour of heaven remember that and kind of just this incredible picture of heaven but people who are still living get this tour of heaven and in this particular scene one of the visitors is taken by the spiritual guide in heaven to an encounter with her husband who's already there so she's living just taking a tour her husband's died and he is in heaven and seeing him she says to her guide if I'm given a free hand, I'll take charge of him again. I'll take up my burden once more. And I hear in my mind, Colossians 1, I labor and strive. And she would say, I'm just like Paul, laboring and striving. I'll take up my burden once more, but I must have a free hand. And with all the time we have here in heaven, I believe I could make something of him. Wouldn't that be a good thing? A loving thing? A giving thing? He's not fit to be on his own. Put me in charge of him. I'm his wife, aren't I? I was only beginning on earth. There's lots and lots of things I still want to do with him. No, listen, please, please. I'm miserable. I must have someone to do things to. And if she would have gotten her wish, heaven would have become hell for that guy. Okay, and the whole point of C.S. Lewis there is that has nothing, what she's wanting to do there, has nothing to do with really desiring to bring someone into the fullness of life in the Spirit. And the other thing is that it has no capacity to do that either. Because even though you may be proclaiming and admonishing and instructing, it's really all about control and the need to fix. Dallas Willard again, this time in his book, The Divine Conspiracy, says this. What we're actually doing with all our proper condemnations, coercions, and wonderful solutions, more often than not, is taking others out of their own responsibility, and even more, out of God's hands, trying to bring them under our control. This was never meant to be, and usually we ourselves do not consciously intend it. We must always respect other people, as spiritual beings in whom Christ lives. Trust him as spiritual beings who are responsible before God alone for the course they choose to take of their own free will. We must always speak the truth in love, which is proclaim, admonish, instruct, but we must never try to manipulate or harass people into righteousness and goodness with our condemnings and our pearls and our holy things, end quotes. But to do that well, to find that balance, I'm suggesting it requires, you have to have a respect. Indeed, I would call it a kind of reverence for and confidence in the Christ in them. So you can proclaim and admonish and teach and then back off. I don't know how to say it any straighter than that relax even sometimes let them go it's a weird thing because I have been considering this as a pastor but I think about it as a dad I've got two sons, I've got two daughters when they're little kids you're going to do what I say there are some disciplines you need to learn and you're going to learn them, I think, I hope, whatever and then high school comes along and all high school is is a battle so that doesn't count. Yes, it does. That's what I was in our house. And then college, though. College, they're kind of becoming their own person and I can't just get all, you can't do that. But you admonish and you teach and I'm their dad and so I tell them what I think and then there's this place where you see them walk out the door and you don't know if you got through or not and I just gotta go, God's in that kid. You know what? Sometimes I even tell them that. You know why? You got no prayer. God's in you. Walk away if you want. You're coming back. God's in you. And it takes a lot of pressure off you, too. You don't have to fix them. Mentors, it's not your job. You don't have to. Just, by the way, just, it leads to the second thing that I think we can learn from Paul in this regard. And then it's this, was that the Apostle Paul was entirely aware of himself, of his process. And among the things he was aware of about himself and his process was that he had not arrived. This is huge, I think. If you kind of let it in, that I haven't arrived and I'm kind of calling people to, you know, a higher standard, that I haven't even arrived at, it doesn't mean you don't call them to a higher standard, but it changes how you do it. Paul, again, Philippians 3, verse 12, says, not that I've obtained it, nor have I already become perfect. There's that word again. Mature, complete. I'm not mature and complete, says Paul. Which means, among other things, that in his admonishing and teaching and proclaiming, he didn't condescend to people. which again I think is a really big deal because it's a lot easier and you know this is true these are things instinctively all of us know you've experienced it it's a lot easier to receive someone's proclamation admonition and instruction if they're not acting all above you if they're actually in it with you you ever been condescended to my dad used to call it talking don't talk down to me like you're up there and I'm down here and I'm, you know, idiot guy. Philippians 3, let's read this. Not that I have already obtained it or have already become perfect, but here is what I do. I press on in order that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus. Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet. I'm on this journey. Come join me. But one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind, reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ. Verse 15, catch this. Let us therefore, as many as are perfect. Stop right there. As many as are perfect. Wait a minute. See, I thought he just got done saying he wasn't perfect. Haven't arrived. And now he's saying as many of us as are perfect have this attitude. Okay, then what is the attitude of those who are perfect or mature? it's simply this very important the attitude of those who are mature is that they know they're not mature that they haven't arrived and this awareness that you have of yourself I am not up here above you I have not arrived that is the attitude of the mature get it? it's kind of a little circular but I do press on I mean I haven't arrived but I'm telling you every ounce of energy in my life is about pressing on toward the upward call of God and I will do that my whole life and if you think that through it can be very liberating because sometimes as a dad or a mom or a husband or a wife mentor or friend you do have to proclaim, admonish and teach but you don't have to pretend you're better or further than them because you may not be. Almost 30 years ago, my wife and I came to this church to be the senior pastor of this church at the age of 27. And I came from another church that I had pastored for four years while I was going to seminary in the Chicago area, which means I pastored that church and got to that church when I was 23 years of age. I mean, what in the world were you thinking? Honestly. and when I was 23 and 24 passing this little church about four people came and sat you know on this huge thing no who do you think you are? it was nuts Philippians 3 help me now here's the deal if 30 years ago at the age of 27 I believed that it was my job to stand before the people of open door mature having arrived complete perfect I would have had two options. Number one, to quit because I'm not mature. I haven't arrived. Or number two, I could do what a lot of people do when they think that is their job, they start to pretend that they are even though they're not. And that's when you put on the pastor voice. Hello. Hello, my little flock. Don't you want to punch me? You just want to punch him. I liked him until then. And worse than those stupid pastor voices, you start to hide and you start to pretend that I can't ever tell anybody what's really going on in my life. But if you have this idea, it is not my job to stand in front of you perfect. It is my job to stand in front of you as a person who is pressing on to the upward call of God in Christ. And I'm going to do that all my life. and I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that passionately and honestly and consistently, and I'm going to do it publicly, and then I'm going to invite people. Anybody want to do that together? Let's just do that together. Amen. See, it's not our job to stand in front of people perfect, but what if we just really knew the only thing we had to do was to press on. Mentors, that's all you've got to do. Dads, moms, that's all you've got to do. Don't even try to stand in front of your kids perfect. That's when, you know, when you even view yourself as, I am always right. You know what really messes it up? You can't ever say you're sorry. Honey, son, I just gotta tell you something. I really blew it over there. You know what gives you freedom to do that? What gives you freedom to tell your kid you're sorry is that you don't have any illusions. You'll understand your own process. I haven't obtained it. I haven't arrived. But son, here's one thing. My passion is to press on. Come with me. Let's do it together. People like that. People follow that. And that is what creates this environment. That's what creates this environment where people like me could actually be formed, but you can bring people with you too. But I'm confident that this very thing, God's in work in you, so I don't have to manipulate you and I don't have to fix you. And the other thing is, We're aware of our own process, so we don't condescend. It's incredibly important stuff. Good news for moms and dads, husbands and wives. Just stand before them in your process, passionately pursuing the upward call of God in Christ. Do it honestly, consistently, and do it publicly. Right in front of your friends. And right in front of your kids. Last thing. Paul actually had a pattern of life and a sweetness of spirit that some people actually wanted to experience. Hmm. Funny how that works. He actually had a pattern of life, a sweetness of spirit that some people actually wanted to follow because it smelled good. Simple question. I close with this. do you. Because if you don't have a pattern of life or sweetness of spirit, the fact is this, you can proclaim until you're blue in the face. You can admonish and you can instruct. You can do it all day long, but no one will be formed by it because no one will follow it. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. In fact, I want to pray right now. Would you join me? Holy Spirit, come. And help us by the power of your Spirit to become the kind of people who are continually becoming, who are continually pursuing the upward call of God in Christ passionately and honestly, consistently and publicly in order that not only will we be formed, but we'll actually be able to bring some people with us like our sons and our daughters and our friends, our husbands and wives who are beginning to experience the fullness of Christ in them, fully formed in them, And to that end we labor and strive and pray. Holy Spirit, come. And continually make us this kind of people because this can change a family. It could change a church. This could change a city. This could change the world. Thy kingdom come. And all God's people said, Amen. Amen.
