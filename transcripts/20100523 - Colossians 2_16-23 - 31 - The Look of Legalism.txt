Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Jesus plus nothing has been the theme for the last several weeks. Born of our study in the book of Colossians. Steve Weems actually started it a couple of weeks ago, a few weeks ago now, in just a normal course of going through the book of Colossians. He came to Colossians 2, verses 6 and 7, where the Apostle Paul was talking about and trying to make practical what it means to be in Christ, what it means to be in him. So therefore, Paul says, Colossians 2, verse 6, As you have received Christ Jesus, Lord, so walk in him, having been firmly rooted and now being built up in him and established in your faith. Your faith is also in him. See to it, because of all of that, see to it, verse 8, that no one knocks you off of that centeredness in him, that no one takes you captive through philosophy or empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ, for in him. There, that in him thing is, again, verse 9, all the fullness of deity dwells in a bodily form, and in him you have been made complete. In other words, it's Jesus plus nothing, because in him you've been made complete. You have everything you need. Therefore, because all that is true, verse 16, and this is where we really focused our attention last week, because all that is true, that it really is Jesus plus nothing, Paul says, let no one act as your judge in regard to food or drink, or in regard to festivals or to a new moon or to a Sabbath day, because apparently, as we kind of explained last week, there were some people in Colossae, most notably Jewish believers, who were doing just that, acting as people's judge with regard to such things as food and drink and celebrating festivals on a certain day in a certain way, because the Jewish believers who lived in Colossae were coming to faith in Christ from Judaism, which means, and I explained this last week, they were coming to faith with what I called last week some background and some baggage, religious background and religious baggage. The background was really good stuff. They came to faith in Christ with a background of having known the Scriptures. They knew the Torah, a background of, it would be like they knew the Bible. They grew up in the synagogue, So they knew the traditions and they observed the festivals, placing a very high value on those things. And there was reason to place high value on these festivals because these festivals that actually God kind of commanded them to do were part of how they told their story as the people of God. Every one of the festivals. It wasn't just a party. It was a party with a purpose. Anyway, party with a purpose. Anyway, I'm sorry. Like the Festival of Pentecost, the Festival of Tabernacles, there was the Festival of Lights. And all of them were how they told the story as the people of God. And they were part of how they remembered, actually, the power of God and the promises of God and the love of God. And when they did these festivals, they would make sacrifices. And they made their sacrifices during these festivals, which just spoke to this rich heritage they had. They would do it on the first day of the month, which is the reference in that verse that sounds weird to us, the new moon. The new moon was the first day of the month. So when they would do the festival, they would do the sacrifice in the festival on the first day of the month, all of which is great. But the problem that Paul is confronting here is not, therefore, that some Jewish believers in Colossae were doing those festivals. That was not the problem. The problem that Paul is confronting here was that there were some Jewish Christians in Colossae who were judging people who didn't do the festivals. So for some in Colossae, it had become Jesus plus the festivals. and Jesus plus the Sabbath but it wasn't even just the festivals and the Sabbath it was how we do the festivals and the Sabbath on the first day of the week which is the right day of the week on the new moon to which Paul says don't let anyone do that to you don't let anyone act as your judge related to those things then verse 18 he continues don't let anyone defraud you literally that word defraud talked about it last week is like an umpire who calls you out Don't let anybody disqualify you by delighting, verse 18, and self-abasement, which for some in Colossae had become a means. You treat yourself fast, extremely, again, extreme fast, and it helps you attain this higher level of supernatural experience, worshiping even with angels. The text says the worship of angels, literally, it was the worship with angels. They were attaining these ecstatic experiences where I'm with the angels and taking their stand on visions they had seen, though often inflated without cause by their fleshly mind, it says. Which means that some were reporting these supernatural experiences they were maybe even having, but they were reporting them as being greater than they actually were, so that now it's Jesus plus festivals, and on the new moon, and feasts, and food, and drink, but also Jesus plus supernatural experience. All of which means that what Paul's confronting in verse 18 of Colossians 2 is exactly the same thing he's confronting in verse 16 of Colossians 2, but it's wearing a different dress. It's manifesting a different way, because again, the real problem was not that some people in Colossae were experiencing supernatural things like seeing visions or speaking in tongues. Nothing at all wrong with those things. It's that they were judging people who weren't experiencing those things, thus defrauding people of their prize. And the prize, I simply think, was this, the joy of the Lord. That sweet sense of confidence and joy that Christ is in me and I am in him. And many of you have experienced that joy. I mean, it's something that many of us report as what we experience when we first come to faith in Christ, this incredible joy. And you experience it till someone comes along and it's almost always, well, no one else would do this but another Christian, they come along and suggest in one way or another that loving Jesus really is good but it's not enough. Something's missing in you. It's Jesus plus something. It's Jesus plus the way we love Jesus which might be the Baptist way or the Catholic way or the Lutheran way or the charismatic way and on and on and on we go. It's Jesus plus eating certain foods, drinking certain drinks, and celebrating certain religious festivals in a certain way on a certain day, and if you don't do it our way, we act as your judge. Like an umpire in a baseball game making the call at home plate, you're out, and all the joy is gone. You've been defrauded of your prize. And all of that is review. That was my sermon last week, which I could have done last week in about five minutes. But all of that brings us to the question of the day that I left you with last week because after talking last week a little bit about the lure of this, why are we so drawn to this? Why does this so often happen to us? And I speculated that I think the reason we're so drawn to it, the lure of it, is that this Jesus Plus thing, it gives us a way to feel superior. It gives us a way to sometimes feel secure because we do it right and you do it wrong because we have something you don't. So I feel a little superior because I do it just a little bit better than you and I feel secure, too, because I obviously do it better. I'm kind of more in than you. After that, however, last week we began to wonder about the look of these things. How can we spot these things when they begin to encroach upon us? Because it's an important thing to be able to do, to spot these things, because there's danger in these things. And among the many dangers of this Jesus Plus message, the first is this. Here's why it's dangerous. because it almost always involves a good thing gone bad. It takes a good thing and spoils it, which means because a good thing is involved, it means that it can encroach itself upon us in ways we don't notice at first. It can come in in very subtle ways because the truth is there's nothing wrong with supernatural experiences. Supernatural experiences are wonderful. There's nothing wrong with speaking in tongues. There's nothing at all wrong with celebrating certain festivals on a certain day. in a certain way, wonderful, especially if it helps you remember the promises of God. There's nothing wrong with reading your Bible or memorizing scripture or spending time in prayer because those are wonderful ways to give your heart access to the presence of God. Nothing wrong with those. Those are all good things unless you begin to think that those things are what qualify you. Unless it's what you use to feel superior or secure, And as soon as that subtle thing kind of with pride creeps in, a really good thing has gone really bad. Because now it's not just Jesus. It's Jesus plus whatever it is you've added. And Paul gets so big about this that in verse 19 he says that when you add something like that, you've cut yourself off from the head who is Christ. Because he's no longer your source for your sense of security and identity rooted in him. it's Jesus plus this other thing that might be good, but now it's gone bad. Although it's at least the second characteristic, the second thing that kind of comes with this package of Jesus plus, and it comes in in subtle ways, because when this Jesus plus something begins to take root, whatever its form, whatever the something is, it invariably brings with it a religious spirit. And I do believe it's a spirit, where image is everything, and how things look is what matters most, but it's a false spirituality where you do indeed really look good on the outside. In other words, Colossians 2 verse 23 says, it really does have the appearance of wisdom or spirituality. It looks really good in self-made religion and self-abasement and the severe treatment of the body. Boy, people who are fasting, they just look like the most holy of all people, but the weird deal is that it's of no value against fleshly indulgence if it's just this thing on the outside. Why? Obviously, why? Because it isn't real. It's just a show. Quite frankly, when I talk about a kind of spirituality that looks good on the outside but has no internal reality, some of you, if you were to give testimony of your experience in church, would say that's exactly what I experienced. Maybe in your family, even. It's part of your background. I talked last week about the background and baggage that the Gentiles in Colossae came with, the Jews came in with baggage and background. Your background and baggage might include this very thing. I hear the stories all the time. Oh, I mean, I hear them over and over, and sometimes I think, you know, well, that kind of thing doesn't happen anymore, and then I hear another story, and they kind of go like this. My dad was a deacon. My mom was a Sunday school teacher. We had the perfect family. We were at church every Sunday, big smiles on our faces, big Bibles under our arms. The whole thing was a sham. See, what that is is this. It had the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion. It looked really good on Sunday morning, but it was of no value. All this smiling and Bible-carrying was of no value in our home. It was of no value like after church, on the ride home. It was of no value in how we lived or how we loved it was a sham. It was a joke, would say many of you, and not a funny joke. Because if there is no internal reality, no interior life, then submitting to decrees such as do not handle, do not taste, do not touch, there's no power, and don't do that, if there's no interior life. For you, they have no power to change anything of value. Now, I can paint pictures of how this manifests or what this looks like or why this is serious in a number of different ways and go a number of different directions. I was reading a paper this week, and this kind of thought occurred to me as I was reading a story about Al Franken, our senator, Al Franken, who was wanting to introduce some legislation to protect kids from being bullied. And I think you've probably read it or watched the news enough to know it's a horrible problem. And kids all over the country, it's kind of becoming known, something that I'm sure has been happening for a long, long time. the kids getting bullied, and it's to the point where kids are literally committing suicide. And so this is an alarming thing. And Franken's legislation was about particularly trying to protect gay kids who, according to him, are three or four times more likely to be bullied than other kids. And as I'm reading this and thinking of this, I thought a couple things. Number one, how sad that you need a law to actually be civil to people. I'm going to put you in jail if you aren't somewhat, you know, giving people room to live. Sad about that. But the other thing that came to me was this, it won't work. It won't work. I mean, it's a well-intended thing. Who wants anybody to get beat up and bullied? Nobody. I don't care who you are. I don't care what you do. You ought to be respected and cared about, and Christians ought to be right in the front of the line doing that. But here's the deal. Having a law, what's it going to do? See, heaven decrees, I'll throw you in jail. Maybe throw somebody in jail, but it won't change the heart. You're still full of robbery and self-indulgence. You're still full of anger and hate. That's what's underneath this. This is why Jesus gets so big. It's not that the behavior is good or bad. The thing is, if we don't have the heart, you got nothing. You can give laws all you want. It won't change a thing. Lots of stories about this. When we first came to Town Bonney and I first moved here to Minneapolis, and, you know, became pastor here almost 30 years ago, about three or four years into our time here, a story broke. It was on the front page of the paper for several, I think, weeks, actually, and on the 10 o'clock news quite a bit. And this story just rocked the evangelical church community here in town, involving a highly visible and well-respected pastor here in town whose church was known most for its incredible youth ministry. And I even remember thinking I was, you know, new here, thinking, hey, really got it going on, and I'd like our youth ministry to be like, they're a youth ministry. But as it turns out, a significant number of youth in that youth group, particularly pre-adolescent boys, were being sexually abused by this wonderful pastor guy, which, as you know, you know, that was a long time ago. It's the same thing right now that's raging through the Catholic Church, and it's in the paper every day or every other day these days. And you kind of get the feeling that maybe Paul was right. If you ever dial into texts like the ones we're dealing with now that these decrees, such as do not handle, do not taste, do not touch, while they do indeed have the appearance of wisdom. It's a good idea. Don't touch that. It really is a good idea to not touch that. But decrees don't have the power to set you free from fleshly indulgence, because in systems where image is everything, the heart, what's really going on inside, gets ignored. You know, we don't care what's going on inside. If you look good, then you pass. Jesus said it this way in Matthew 23, 25, that in systems where how things look is what matters most, you invariably develop people, and this is what I mean by these things just come along. They're in the soup. You invariably develop people who spend all their time and energy polishing the outside of the cup and of the bull. Matthew 23, verse 25. You hypocrites, he says. You spend all your time polishing the outside of the cup and of the bull, but inwardly you're full of robbery and self-indulgence. You hypocrites. Paul said it this way. This problem didn't go away in Galatia. Galatians chapter 6 in his fierce battle there, and that's what it was. And this is a battle. When you start confronting this stuff, you have a battle on your hands because this religious spirit is very strong. In Galatians 6, in this fierce battle with the Judaizers who were saying to the Gentile believers in Galatia, it's Jesus plus Judaism, which kind of boiled down to it's Jesus plus get circumcised. Paul to them said that they are those, chapter 6, verse 12. In fact, for six chapters, he's been kind of trying to lay this theology out that would set people free. And it's kind of like in this verse, He says, here's the bottom line. These people are those whose primary desire is making a good show in the flesh. It's all about how things look to these guys, but not only that, they will try to compel you to live the same way, to get you to be circumcised as well is what the text says, living the same way where image is everything and how things look is what matters most and the only way to really look good, to look really good and to look really spiritual so that you know you're in and secure and a little superior is to get circumcised or to eat certain food or drink or celebrate the festival on a certain day in a certain way and on and on and on it goes because it's Jesus plus something that makes you feel superior it makes you feel secure and before you know it before you know it image is everything you didn't start out that way but this comes in before you know it image is everything how things look is what matters most indeed the way we've been saying it here at Open Door for years and years and years. This is something that's kind of in the DNA of this church's life. The way we've been saying it is this, that if you are in a system, family system, church system, school, group of friends, where how things look is what matters most, then how things actually are in your life will never get talked about, never get dealt with, and never get healed or forgiven. Indeed, in systems like this, where how things look is what matters most, it actually becomes more important that people think you're doing well than you're actually doing well. It becomes more important that people think you're really spiritual and got it going on than you really are spiritual. It's more important that people think you have a good marriage than you actually have a good marriage, which isn't that exhausting? I mean, just think of some of us live like that, and some of us kind of go in and out of living like that, And what I want to tell you, born of Colossians chapter 2, is this, that the best way to do that, to get people to think you're doing better than you actually are, is to spend all sorts of time and energy polishing the outside of the cup and of the bowl. Just make sure you look good all the time. And born of Colossians chapter 2, the most effective polishing agent pretty much known to man are these highly visible, relatively superficial boundary markers that make me feel okay, that make me feel secure, that make me feel superior, that help me know I'm in. But they're external things pertaining to food and drink and to celebrating certain festivals on a certain day in a certain way, but now, ha ha, I'm okay. Problem. All of those things. Whatever they are, good though they might be, I can easily do without a change of heart. Without a new heart, without a clean heart, I could still be full of robbery and self-indulgence. But I went to church, and I celebrated the festival in a certain way, on a certain day, the right way. And I read my Bible, and I didn't swear, and I didn't drink, and I spoke in tongues, must be okay. and all of that, all of that, is at least part of why Jesus said what he said in Matthew chapter 5. This is so fundamental. In the Beatitudes, among the first things Jesus ever said about life in the kingdom of God, he said this, blessed are those who mourn. Matthew 5, verse 4, and if you've been at Open Door for any length of time at all, you know that blessed are those who mourn does not mean blessed are the bummed or happy are the sad. The Greek word for mourn there is the Greek word penthos, which literally speaks to externally expressing or revealing what's internally real. So the way we've been saying it around here for years is this. Blessed are those who get out here, what's going on in here, who quit pretending and hiding the fact that they really are full of robbery and self-indulgence. Blessed are those who quit investing in the image and start dealing with their sin, they alone. And in the Greek, in Matthew 5, verse 4, it's in the emphatic. They are the only ones, those who quit pretending and denying and quit investing in the image, they are the only ones who get the comfort and the grace and the healing and the transformation from the inside out. But you have to quit pretending and hiding and denying, and you have to quit investing in the image because here's the deal. This message of Jesus plus something that Paul is confronting in Colossians 2, that Jesus is confronting in Matthew 23, that Paul is confronting in Galatians 5, really does bring with it a religious spirit that is very hard to break once it gets a foothold in a family or church or a system of any kind because image is everything and this spirit will not leave without a fight. And some of you know that all the way down to the ground because you've had to root it out of your own spirit maybe, of your family or a church. And all that leads to a third characteristic. The third thing that just kind of comes invariably and manifests wherever this Jesus plus message is. First thing, good things go bad. Second thing, images, everything. Third thing, values get inverted such that really serious things in systems like this without anybody doing this on purpose, all of a sudden real serious things that could actually do damage are treated in trivial ways. Ah, we'll just ignore that. While really trivial things are treated as if they're really big deals and you can get in a whole lot of trouble because you broke this stupid little rule. I'll try to explain this a little better. I don't know about you, but when I'm around this, what I'm trying to describe here, and maybe it's because I grew up in the church with some background and some baggage of my own, like I talked about last week. But when I'm around this kind of thing, I can smell it. And I can feel it. And among the things I feel when I'm around it, whether it be a person who's kind of carrying this, and you can tell by just the way they talk, it's just the strangest thing. I can smell it. But one of the things I feel is fear. Fear, yeah, yeah. And here's one of the reasons it induces fear, at least in me, because in a system where serious things are trivialized and trivial things are made serious, people aren't safe. People are not safe. Let me explain that. Matthew 23, 23. Jesus is describing some people. In this case, it again is described in the Pharisees who he's confronting for their hypocrisy. And what he says in that verse is, you tithe, dilimente, and cumin, but you neglect the weightier matters of the law like justice, mercy, and faithfulness. It's a fascinating picture. tithing dylan meant in cumin to tithe something fact is in israel there were three tithes in jesus day a tithe we've talked about this before is like giving a tenth of something the first there were three tithes so the first tithe went to support the temple system the the kind of paid the salary if you will of the priest the priests in the sanhedrin the second tithe in israel was for celebrating national festivals um and so that was part of the third tithe extracted from the people was a tithe to to minister to the poor actually it was kind of their welfare system so you had three tithes about 30 percent of your income was going to pay taxes in this theocracy and that didn't even count the taxes that came from Rome but in addition to those tithes in Leviticus 27 there was this this obscure little tithe that not many people paid attention to that involved and I'm quoting Leviticus 27 the increase of thy seeds you should tithe your seeds and seeds are what dill, mint, and cumin are. Those are little tiny seeds. So get the picture. The fact that these Pharisees, and Jesus is making an incredible confrontation here, the fact that they were tithing seeds, like if they had 10 seeds they would give one. If they had 20 they would give two. Real careful about that. And feeling incredibly superior. Can't you see it? I tithe even the seeds. Wow. You're something. Feeling really superior about that. While they were doing that which is fine. They were ignoring issues like justice, mercy, faithfulness. And here's why I call it dangerous, these things when they get inverted. Because if you don't, I mean, if you tithe seeds, good. But nobody dies if you don't. But if there isn't justice or mercy or faithfulness, like really big things, people die. People die. This is really dangerous when values get inverted. and it comes with this, it's just in the soup. It will be there before you know it. Matthew 23, verse 24, Jesus calls this inversion of values. He says, you're straining at gnats and swallowing camels. I love that picture. It's designed to be intentionally ludicrous, as if to say this is just, what you're doing, you guys, is just ridiculous. Do you see, even, what you're doing? with this tithing seeds, but not caring about justice. You get all picky, is what he's saying, about these little things that don't matter at all. They would literally, let me explain the straining gnats and swallowing camels, during festivals or ceremonial times, it was really important to say ceremonially clean. And one way you could become ceremonially unclean would be to touch something unclean, like an animal, including insects. and so Pharisees would take that to the extreme and they would drink their wine and they would sift they would drink their wine and sift kind of through their teeth and make sure no gnats would get in and they would pick out oh I got this but they would swallow a camel which they couldn't do you couldn't swallow a camel he's being facetious to get them to see how ridiculous what they do is it's so bizarre are you blind? can't you see what you're doing? he says in verse 24. You blind guy. It's weird. I remember as a kid seeing this very thing. The big things didn't matter. The little things really big. But when you get around that, just run for your life. Just run for your life. People whose lips never ever touched a glass of wine, who never played cards, not even rook. That was the way you could really tell you were in and better than me, obviously bowling was borderline you know why because almost all you know bowling what's in a bowling alley bar there's a bar in there okay fine so they didn't smoke or drink or dance which is fine fine dill i mean tithe dill and mint and cumin go ahead and tithe do that don't do that stuff but they were bitter and sour not all of them but i remember the ones who were bitter and sour and angry and malicious gossips, particularly about people who didn't celebrate the festival on a certain day in a certain way like we did. Just rip them to shreds. And that was okay. But we really made sure we didn't bowl. Good for you. Now that kind of stuff is irritating. I mean, you know, that's just growing up in church. People are people. You can't control that stuff. We all get kind of picky and prickly from time to time. And it does some damage. But nobody dies, you know. You kind of get over it and make fun of it later. Like the lady who, after a particularly fidgety morning service, for me, eight years old, turns around in church and looks at me and goes, Are you saved? I want to be from you so it's just goofy stuff you know I'm still here I'm okay it didn't kill me but but let me let me bring you back to that story I told you about that pastor who was sexually abusing little kids it's really funny because that did happen here in town and i knew some of the people who were affected by that and it was really weird because one of the things that people who knew him remembered about him was how picky he was about little things and at the time you just go whatever it's just his way you know but i mean i mean if he was teaching a class of little kids and someone was chewing gum i mean you you would you would be humiliated i mean it was so chewing gum's a big deal. It's a really big deal. No, it's not. It's a deal. Stop to and go. And the other thing that these guys told me about, that they just, it's just so weird. He made a big deal of this, and this is why they remembered that if someone showed up to serve communion, then they didn't have a tie and a suit on, they couldn't serve communion. It was a really big deal that you wore a tie. But he's sexually abusing little boys, kind of getting away with that for years. Literally, don't sweat the gum. But here's the deal. When this stuff comes in, you know, Jesus plus nothing, yeah, we should watch for that. Yeah, you better watch for this. People die. When this system begins to take root, a spiritual, a religious spirit comes in, images everything. Values get inverted and people get destroyed. And all of that is why Paul says what he says in Colossians 2. Because in religious systems where it becomes Jesus plus, invariably, good things, really good things, like reading your Bible and memorizing Scripture and speaking in tongues and experiencing supernatural things with God, they just go sour. And before you know it, image is everything. And with all of that, values get inverted. You didn't even see it happen. But when it happens, people get destroyed. So what's the antidote to this? Well, the short answer is this. Indeed, this is the ultimate answer. The short answer is grace. Grace is the antidote to this. But to get to grace, because not everybody gets grace. To get to grace, you'd have to mourn first. That's how grace comes. You have to quit pretending. you have to quit hiding you have to quit investing in the image because until you do you'll never get to what's really going on inside the robbery and self-indulgence whatever it is that's going on you have to quit pretending to get to grace you have to mourn but to get to mourning to get to that you have to actually see your sin you have to see the camels that you're swallowing and the gnats that you're staining but Jesus to these people he kept saying you're blind you blind guides so how do you see something when you're blind you don't see it well here's my question what might help you see it well I think we'll talk about that next week little teaser here on next week when Jesus dealt with legalists or was polishing the outside of the cup and of the bowl, he didn't give them grace. What? Jesus was told? No, he didn't give he didn't give them grace. He gave them something that led to grace. And that is what we'll talk about next week. Will you stand with me as we close? Father, I, um, It's strange because I actually, I feel grateful as I get into this text, Colossians 2, and I reflect on Matthew 23, and then again, Galatians 5, I'm grateful to you for you. Because when I see these words of yours, Jesus, in Matthew 23, it dawns on me that you fought for us against this kind of system, and you paid a pretty high price for that. And it makes me grateful for Paul as well that he saw this stuff and the death that can come from it and he had the courage to fight it and I thank you for that and give us the courage to do the same. To quit pretending. To continually keep that as a priority value in our spirit, in our church so that we can live as free people before God dealing authentically and honestly with our sin because for our sin there is amazing grace and healing and a new kind of life. And I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
