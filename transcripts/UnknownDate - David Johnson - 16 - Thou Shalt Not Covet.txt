Open your Bibles to Exodus 20, verses 15 to 17. We are coming, believe it or not, to our final week in our study of the Ten Commandments. That means we are coming to the Tenth Commandment, you shall not covet. In fact, what I'm doing is dealing with the Eighth Commandment, you shall not steal, and the Tenth together because it is out of our coveting that we steal. In fact, it is also out of our coveting that we also bear false witness. Not the false witness that I spoke of for two weeks relative to being in a witness stand and lying, but false witness against a neighbor that would slander, gossip, that kind of thing, all born out of coveting. Let's read the text and begin. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor. Webster's Dictionary reveals in its definition of covetousness that beyond strong desire for something, and all by itself strong desire for something is not a bad, evil thing necessarily, but beyond healthy ambition or pursuit of a dream, covetousness unreasonably or unlawfully desires to possess what belongs to another. The text is specific as to what is unlawfully desired by covetousness, your neighbor's house, your neighbor's spouse, your neighbor's possessions. And if you understand the culture a little bit, these possessions also spoke to position or status or career. So I'll throw in your neighbor's position. Clear about this. We need to be covetousness is not dreaming about and planning for another house someday. It's being so discontent with mine that I can't hardly rest till I have yours. Covetousness is not strongly desiring a better marriage and setting out to do the work required for that better marriage. Covetousness is being so discontent with my marriage that I want your marriage. Indeed, beyond your marriage, I want your spouse. And now you've got adultery. And wherever there is adultery, and whatever else adultery does, it steals. And adultery has never once happened without lying. And all of a sudden, you begin to realize that all of those behaviors are born out of the same place, covetousness. Some would minimize this particular commandment that relative to its danger, wink the eye at it, acknowledging we all do it. Some indeed would even seem to be proud of it. Recent article, Wall Street Journal front page story entitled The Haves and the Have-Nots, documented the wave of envy gnawing at those near the top of the economic pyramid as they see others having even more. The article quotes many haves as readily acknowledging, no problem, right out there with their acknowledgement, that they covet their neighbors' boats, stock options, and homes. unaware that maybe there's something wrong with that. It's hard to imagine those same people freely admitting in a newspaper of national circulation that they lie, steal, cheat, and kill. Maybe this one's not that big a deal because coveting isn't a prosecutable offense or because it comes at the end of the list. God was kind of out of commandments, really, and he just wanted to round it off to a nice round number. People don't take it seriously. The real problem and danger of covetousness, however, is this. It is the gateway to other sin. Envy opens the door to rumors, gossip, meanness, lies, slander. For envy, people steal, sometimes their neighbor's wife. The point of all of that is this. It's not a minor matter. Important to clarify as we begin to wade into this particular issue that you shall not covet does not prohibit desiring something. It does not come against ambition or dreams that you might have. Those things are not necessarily wrong. Indeed, some of the dreams and desires you have right now have been given to you by God and need to be pursued. Intimacy in your marriage, depth of your relationships, integrity in your business dealings, the glory of God and the advancement of his kingdom are all good God desires. Paul had an ambition, a deep desire he pursued with everything he had. It was an ambition for which he would suffer the loss of all things. In Philippians chapter 3, his ambition was revealed as this, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings. The biggest ambition I have in life is that I may be conformed to the image of his death. I want to know him, be found in him, and be just like him. Covetousness is when in our pursuit of whatever it is we are desiring, and hang on to this as you do your own work around this, what it is you may be desiring here is maybe even a good thing. Covetousness, however, is when we cross the line from desire to demand. Have you ever felt that? Yes. When we cross the line from ambition to greed, from a dream to the nightmare of relentless discontent and ingratitude that spells destruction for you and everyone around you. Destruction? It's a little strong, Dave. Why? Because ultimately what covetousness does by its very nature, by its definition is this. It consumes. It consumes people. It consumes possessions. It consumes positions that you think you have to have. And ultimately, the real evil of covetousness is that if you have it, it will consume you. Even as you consume those other things. Hebrews chapter 13, verse 5 says this. Let your character or your way of life be free from covetousness and be content with such things as you have. For he himself has said, I am all you need. I will be your bread. I will be your water. I will never leave you nor forsake you. According to that text, the antithesis of and the antidote for covetousness is contentment. And according to the text, the key to contentment is trust. that he really is the bread, that he really will satisfy my needs, and that he really won't leave me or forsake me. But all of that raises a question. Raises many questions, actually, but one, to keep us online here, is the question that Brennan Manning raised in this pulpit last week when he spoke of ruthless trust. The question is this, and I've got to make it personal for me. Hey, Johnson, do you really believe that God is involved in your life and cares for you? Do I really believe that he knows my name, he knows my need, that he really is my provider, my source, that he really is my bread, that he really is my water? Do I really believe that I can trust him or do I have to grasp people, possessions, and positions for myself? Because what I, at the core of my being, believe is this, that if I don't take care of me, nobody else will. Webster, it was interesting to me, the dictionary further defines a covetous person as one who grasps a grasper. And I think the picture there is powerful. 1 Peter 5, 6 says, humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God. And doing that is going to take trust. And my promise, he says, is this, I will exalt you at the proper time. But there are going to be times when you're humbling yourself and you're not feeling exalted. You're not getting that place. The grasper says, not by his words, but by his life. I don't believe that. I'm going to exalt myself. I'm going to grab it, demand it myself. Matthew 6, 33, Jesus says, I tell you, let me give you some help for kingdom, life, and joy. Here's my advice. Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. And I promise you all these things will be added unto you. And all these things in the context were physical things like people, positions, and possessions. The grasper says not with his words. I mean with his words he might be quoting verse. But with the way he lives he says I don't believe that. I'm going to grab all these other things for myself right now. And quite frankly, you better get out of my way. Because if you get in my way and keep me from them, I'll slander you, steal from you, lie to you and about you to get them. Beloved, the antidote to covetousness is not trying really hard to not be covetous. Because you know it's wrong. That will have no power to break. The power of covetousness. The antidote to covetousness that I have seen work in my life, when this ugly thing has raised its head in my spirit, and it has and it does, it's when I come back home and begin to believe again things that at the core of my being I really do believe but sometimes forget, God, you're my only possible hope. You are my source, and I was acting like he was, and I was acting like that was, and those things leave me thirsty, and I come out with such evil things. You are my bread, and you are my water. Come back with me to Hebrews 13.5. The word character. Let your character be free from covetousness. The word character is an interesting and helpful word for our understanding of this dilemma of covetousness when it raises its head. It comes from the Greek word tropos. We get our English word tropic or tropics. It's very graphic here. It speaks to, the word tropics does, it speaks to climate, region, environment, temperature. I think all of us know that when it comes to tropics or regions of the world as it relates to weather, there are some climates that are so hostile, either so hot or so cold, so wet or so dry, that very few things can live and even less can grow. Then you move to different kinds of climates, more moderate, and some things can grow, but other things can't. We live in Minnesota. You don't see many palm trees here. The environment is not good for them. they will not grow. Too hot, too dry, too cold, too wet. That understanding applied to this verse makes the verse sound this way. Don't let the climate of your life, don't let the environment in which you live be consistently characterized by covetousness, discontent, and ingratitude. Why? Two reasons that I can think of right off the bat as it relates to this weather thing. One reason you shouldn't let it be marked by those is because of what the environment of covetousness and discontent grows. The second reason is because of what the environment of covetousness and discontent kills. Let me tell you, if you are a person whose environment, whose way of life is discontent, let me tell you what you grow. You grow a jungle of futility. You experience a leanness of soul, a barrenness of spirit, and I promise you a life sentence of dissatisfaction. It will never be enough for you. Let me tell you what this environment of discontent and gratitude and covetousness kills. It will kill the life of God in you. I do not by that mean you lose your salvation. That's not where I'm going. I'm talking about the vibrancy. I think you know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the life of God in you being able to grow in you, express himself through you. I promise you, discontented environments, ingratitude, covetous spirits like a jungle choke off the life of God. And you may be redeemed, may be by God's grace going to heaven, But there will be nothing of the life of God emanating through you that anybody else could ever discern. Tell you what else it kills. It kills marriages. Marriages can't flourish in this environment. Relationships won't last. Possessions will never bring you any joy. They can never fully satisfy possessions. But there are possessions. You see some people, they're just grateful. They may have a lot. They may have a little. They're just grateful. get some joy, I promise you. If your environment is discontent, even possessions, lots of them, never bring joy. Even successful careers won't fulfill. It will never be enough. Why? Because covetousness by nature consumes. It devours. That's what it does. And it devours people, possessions, and positions, the very things you're trying to get to be content. And what's odd is that once you even get them, the positions, the possessions, the person that you thought you have to have, you can't enjoy it. I really got a picture of this. It was weird. I pictured that covetousness was an entity, like a monster in the science fiction movie Alien. How many of you saw it? Don't admit it. Well, why not? Who cares? I mean, I saw it. And there's this monster, and what it does, essentially, is consume. There's no reasoning with it. And what dawned on me was that as soon as this monster consumes the latest human being or whatever, it needs more. It's never satisfied. It needs more and more and more. I mean, it doesn't even stop to think. Oh, that was good. Doesn't even, not even that grateful. Not even like, well, I enjoyed it. That was good. Got a little pudgy, a little flavor. Didn't even enjoy that much. What's the next one? That's a stupid illustration, but it works for me Here's the deal, and here's the punch behind this It is sadly ironic, and it is just the way life works That the people who grasp may in fact get They may get the house, they may get the position, they may get the person That they always dreamt of But if you are a grasper, I promise you You will never enjoy what you get because it will never be enough. And before you know it, you're going to need a bigger one, a better one, a brighter one, a richer one, a prettier one, a faster one. Contrast all that to the person who has responded, not with perfection here, but with simplicity and purity of heart as best they know how by the power of the Spirit to the Word of God and the environment of their life. Again, a storm here and there. that would kind of look greedy and come in bad. But generally, the environment of their life is that they're seeking first the kingdom of God. And they're not making the stuff their goal. Contrast all that stuff I said to the person who honestly, authentically is humbling him or herself under the mighty hand of God and releasing to God the need to be exalted. here's the deal about that person when God gives to that person the stuff all these things I'll give to you when God exalts that person at the proper time and gives them the possession the person or the position you know what they feel? you know what they experience? they experience something graspers never do experience joy. Experience gratitude. Oh, God, you gave me a gift. And they giggle. They experience, well, you don't have to giggle. You know what they experience? They experience what I saw my father exhibit almost his whole life. My dad, honestly, as I reflect on him, and you've got to be careful when, you know how when people die, all of a sudden they're beyond belief perfect. And I'm very aware of my dad's shortcomings. Most of them have been built into me, so I'm very aware of them. But he lived with a sense of wonder. The truth is about him, when it came to his lot in life and what was going on in his life, the most common expression from his mouth was, wow. And the truth is, he didn't have any stuff. The stuff he had wouldn't have made most people go, wow. See the truth about my dad is that when God used him he was surprised Me? Me? When God blessed him he was grateful When God prospered him he was giddy like a child You know how football coaches sometimes tell players who score touchdowns In fact Bud Grant used to say this Act like you've been there before Don't do all this dancing and jumping around and spiking the ball, just going to the end zone, act like you've been there before, drop the ball, hand it to the ref, and just walk back. Kind of act cool about it. And I understand that. My brother's a coach, and he kind of gets on his players if they go crazy like that. My brother's big thing is he doesn't want the kids to act like the game is over. It's only a touchdown. So kind of keep it in perspective. And also, I think it's kind of pulling people against drawing attention to themselves. But as I thought of that, and I thought of my dad, here's the truth about my dad. My dad could never act like you've been here before. Me? Because every time God used him, blessed him or prospered him, he was a little bit surprised. He really did live his life in a simple way, focused on this one thing, I'm going to seek the kingdom. And when God added to him other things, like a family, and like a wife who adored him, and like children who respected him, and like a ministry that I think was probably more effective than he ever knew, his response to that, was grateful. And he was able to authentically do what graspers never can, enjoy. The gifts God gave. Here's my question. Are you anywhere near that? Are you anywhere near that right now? Take the temperature. Take the temperature of your environment. Here's a fact. And this, though I think in some ways it's a tough word, this word is so full of grace and it's such a call to come back into freedom and joy. Here's the fact. You see, covetousness devours joy. Covetousness devours your sense of wonder. There are some of you right now that as you take your temperature, you're aware that you don't have any joy at all and you can't even remember wonder. Some of you actually believe that the reason you don't have it is because someone, something, some position you don't have. Maybe it's none of that. Maybe it's covetousness has consumed your gratitude and devoured your joy. The bottom line is this. Covetousness has a very ugly face. And the reason God in the Ten Commandments is calling us away from it is because covetousness devours, not only positions people and possessions, it devours us. And I would call you to joy. The face of covetousness. I'm going to tell you what's on it. I've already said these. I want to give them to you in bullet form. The first thing that you'll notice about covetousness is ungratefulness. It is altogether ungrateful. Covetousness in gratitude has the power, think about this, has the power to blind you to the wonder of what you have. Covetousness is not simply wanting more than what you have. It makes you despise what you have, therefore blinding you to the people you already have. to the possessions you already have, to the position you already have. There is nothing wrong with wanting a better relationship, a better position. There's nothing wrong with that. Covetousness makes you despise the one you have. I think it's safe to say that Bonnie and I, Bonnie's my wife, both in our marriage want more. We really desire more intimacy, more sense of oneness. And for close to 25 years we've been married, we've spent a lot of energy and time working toward more. But I promise you, covetousness is more than wanting more. Covetousness pushes past desiring more than what you have to despising what you have so that before you know it, you are blind to what you have, to any positive trait that is there. And if covetousness invaded my spirit relative to my marriage, I promise you I would be incapable of seeing any beauty in my wife. I would be incapable of seeing any virtue or any value. And I would begin to say things like this. Why can't you be more like my neighbors? Why? This is an evil, consuming thing. As I reflected on how this plays out in my spirit, one of the most obvious was this beautiful gym we meet in. You know, I don't have a problem at all. I don't think there's anything wrong at all with desiring something more. I do. I promise you. I do. And we're praying for a permanent place. And I'm even hoping it's a little nicer. You're a covetous person. You want air conditioning. Yes, I do. Thank you very much. And you know the scoreboard? We're not going to bring it with us. We're not going to bring it with us. Oh, somebody's sad. We'll put in a little glass, you know, case to show everyone. There's nothing wrong with desiring something more. But let me tell you something else about me. Every once in a while, I'll come in this place. There may be other things going on in my life. I don't even know what it is all the time. But I will go past wanting something more to despising this. And it'll fatigue. It doesn't matter what it is. But I'll just start to look at this and I'll think. I hate this thing and that noise in the bleachers and I'm pointing to you noise over there in the bleachers I don't mean necessarily about the gym but do you know what I'm talking about? not necessarily the gym maybe it is for you too but you know what I'm talking about when you cross that line and all of a sudden you can't see and all of a sudden God just rebukes us and it's a gentle it's a hard one but it's so much for our good because there's such bondage in despising and all of a sudden I can't see the virtue I can't see the value I can't see the wonder of what God does week after week after week in this ugly place bless God for this provision but do I want something more? yeah but thank you God for this not only is covetousness ungrateful, it's insatiable. I've already given you that. It's never enough. Not only that, it distorts your values and impairs your judgment. It impairs your judgment. It gets you to do stupid things. There were many things that knit my heart to David Busby. We had many the same desires, many the same passions. One of the things that you may not know knit my heart to his, What we had is that we had the same love affair with cars. In particular, I don't know if you'll even know what these are, 240Zs, Z car, not the Datsun 240Z, became Nissan's, the Mariner's, the X's. Anyway, three and a half years ago, Dave and I just got fantasizing and talking about 240Z. It's a 73 240Z and how if we bought it together, you know, if you buy it together, it's half off. So we talked our wives into that, and we really got preached. It's $3,000. He put in $15,000. I put in $15,000, something like that. Actually, it was a 50-50 deal, and I said, Dave, you pay for it. I'll drive it 50-50. Anyway. So we did that, and it was cool, and it was fun. We're tooling around, and we're looking at the car. This thing, you know, it's like when you have to have it, it just kind of starts making poor judgments. And we're looking at it, and we love this car. It's just satisfied every need we ever had for a fun little sports car. But wouldn't it look better with wheels? Check out the wheels. The wheels are cool, but they're kind of dull. Deep dish. A little wider tires. Okay. And if you buy it together, it's half off. So we did that. About a year later, this was a little 73 white Z car. About a year and a half later, a year later, whatever, Dave saw a red one. It was a little newer. Had T-tops, bigger engine, wider tires. and if you bite together it's a half off so we did that and by the way Dave had a lot easier time with Luana than I had with Bonnie because I just got to tell you the inside thing with Dave was the way I say Dave how bad do you want this thing how far are you willing to go this is the way I could tell if you really really wanted it Are you willing to pull out I have a fatal disease card? You're afraid to laugh at that one. He would pull out. He'd say, yeah, I am. I'm ready. Well, why not? I'm going to die pretty soon. We need to get this. And he'd say, okay. She could never say no at that point. That's another reason I hung around. What am I? Do you understand? You know what? We didn't get into real trouble. Well, I got to let it into a little. But that speaks to a mentality that impairs your judgment. And some of us have gotten into serious trouble around this, are in serious debt, jeopardizing our families. And then you get a second job to keep up with it, maybe a third. All of a sudden, everybody in the family is working. You hardly ever see each other. Who knows what the kids are up to? Kingdom involvement. No time. I'm servicing the debt because I just had to have it. Don't have time to give. Don't have money to give. And before you know it, you're investing all the juices of your life in things you don't care about. Covetousness distorts your values and impairs your judgment. The fourth thing it does, the fourth thing on the face of it is that it reproduces other sins. And I've already given you that. For covetousness, people steal, slander, lie, cheat, kill, abandon their spouse, abandon their kids because they simply had to have something more. Into all of that, the Apostle Paul in Philippians chapter 4 says an extraordinary thing. He says this, I have learned the secret of contentment. Whether I'm in humble means or prosperity, whether I'm full or going hungry, whether I have abundance or suffering need, I have learned the secret of being content. I think we'd all agree that that's an amazing thing to say, especially when you think of the circumstance within which he said that he was in prison expecting to die. The appropriate and obvious question around that statement is what is the secret to contentment, Paul? And how do we come to learn it? I'm not going to exhaust that question. I'm going to share with you how contentment is often, I say it this way, forced upon me. And I'm going to suppose on you as well. See, one of the ways that God teaches us contentment is that he allows us to taste our discontent for a very long time. You want to grumble and complain and be ungrateful? Dave, okay, here's the deal. God says, just get a real belly full of that. I'm going to let you live in that for a while. And after we've grasped and grabbed and devoured everything we could and even have gotten some of the things we thought were going to finally do it, we come up wondering, what's missing? And we even get a little ticked off because we look around and we see some people who don't have as much as us by way of people, possessions, and positioning, but they seem to be content, maybe even happy. Why is that? Well, I know why. Some people are content with less. They're stupid. Their standards aren't as high. They're satisfied with less. Their expectations aren't as lofty. See, my mind is so bent that I can actually turn discontent into a virtue. I have high standards. Well, it's at that point that if we're lucky, God gives us a gift. The gift is this, that reality sits down with our expectations and has a heart-to-heart talk. And what reality says to us and me quite often is this. David, the people, possessions, and positions that you are grasping for do not, whether you believe it or not, Do not have the power to fill that void, to heal your hurt, to satisfy your soul. Here is the unmovable truth, however, about that. As long as you believe that they do, you will grasp for them. And you will demand of them things that they cannot ever provide. and even as you devour them and even as you get some of them, you will be dissatisfied with them and you will never be content. And then it comes like a whisper. You need to drink from a different well. You need to eat at a different table. And I would just invite you back home. I would just invite you back home. My wife and I got married at a very early age. I was 21, she was 20. The first two years of our marriage were the toughest of our marriage. We joke about the fact that our honeymoon lasted about 10 minutes. The fact is we were nuts about each other. And I make it sound worse than it was sometimes. But clearly, our first two years were our toughest. Part of why that was was because we both came into our marriage with invisible but very real expectations. Bonnie's was that she was marrying a man who would satisfy her deepest longings, provide a kind of non-stop thrill ride of emotional intimacy, personal affirmation, and physical ecstasy. So actually, she pretty much got, you know, what she wanted. Yeah. You know, I'm running out of time, and I'm still not leaving that story out. That's a funny one. The truth is, you know that isn't true. You know me? Here is the truth, actually. I love my wife with all my heart, and she loves me with all her heart. And we have experienced levels of intimacy that actually have surprised and exhilarated us both over and over. But I want to tell you something. Even on our best day, something's missing. Because neither one of us are capable of filling the void in the other. Neither one of us are capable of healing the hurt. We can be vehicles for healing for each other. But I can't heal her hurt and she can't heal mine. Both of us, if we're ever going to experience the intimacy that we experience, if we're ever going to enjoy each other, not just consume each other, both of us have got to be drinking from a different well. We've got to be eaten at a different table. And then I hear the whisper again. It comes from the lover of my soul and the lover of yours. He says this, I am the bread of life. Not your wife and not your position and not your possession. I am the water that can quench your thirst. Beloved, the antidote to covetousness and the secret to contentment is not trying really hard not to be covetous. And trying really hard to be content. it's just coming back to believe again what maybe we forgot God is my source I forgot God is my provider I forgot He is my only helper He is my only bread He is my only water and the minute I forget that and sometimes you can forget it five times in the course of a day the minute I forget it ungrateful discontent gives birth again to covetousness close with this verse Revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let the one who hears say come and let the one who is thirsty come and let the one who may be in the course of this week or this last month or this last year began to get off course and begin to actually believe that this person or this possession or this position could fill me and it gave birth to any gratitude and discontent and covetousness. Let that one come and take the water of life without cause. You struggling with covetousness? I promise you we all do from time to time. Are you consuming people? Possessions? Positions? As if they could somehow fix you. I don't have, as I close, a big rebuke for you if you are. I have an invitation. Come and drink from a different well. You know, you can turn around today. Come and eat at a different table. And from that will come the restoration of your joy. And maybe even a sense of wonder. And sight to your eyes again, allowing you to see what you already have in people, possessions and positions. Let's stand and be dismissed. Would you be quiet before the Lord just for a minute? I think this word has been so plain that you probably already know if you're drinking from a different well what that is. just listen to the spirit of God allow him to woo you back to himself Father God we are wanderers we desperately love you but there are times that we forget that you're the only one that can satisfy the hungers of our soul and we come up ungrateful and discontent and the best of us do and grateful that in the middle of our ugly covetousness you stand there with invitations that say, oh, come back home come back home to freedom I want you to come back home to joy come back home to wonder come back home to being able to see again what you already have Father work this work of freedom in us spirits of gratefulness and gratitude joy and wonder and from those places of gratitude oddly desire more of your kingdom purposes. Desire more of gifts you have to give but not from discontent. What a work this would be if you blew through our congregation with this spirit. I pray it be done. In Jesus' name. All God's people say, Amen.
