Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. It was almost five months ago. Actually, I checked this week, the first weekend of September. We began a journey into the Sermon on the Mount, the introduction of which is the Beatitudes. So today, as we come to the eighth and final Beatitude, is found in Matthew 5, verse 10 through 12. What it actually is is the conclusion of the introduction. It's kind of nice to feel every once in a while like you actually finished something, and after five months we've finished the introduction, which begins with these words. Blessed are those. In the Greek, the real nuance here is, blessed are those of you. And I want you to dial in right away to him in ways that he wasn't maybe with the other people. Looking these 12 disciples around him right in the eye. Blessed are those of you who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when men cast insults at you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely on account of me. Rejoice and be glad. Okay. For your reward in heaven is great. Well, that's nice. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. First time Jesus said anything like this to these guys, it's the first time he said anything like anything to them. It was the first thing out of his mouth relative to the realities of the kingdom of God. But this is a theme that he unpacks more than once on his journey with these three. Matthew 10, he kind of says it again and gives them a little bit more detail of the kinds of things they might face and basically says, you need to not be surprised because a student is not above his master. And if you do the things I did and if you say the things I say, you're going to get the things I got. Again, because the student is not above his master. If you really follow in my way, you're going to get somewhat of some of what I got. Later, Peter, who was also one of the original 12, hearing these things from Jesus would say to his followers, his churches, don't be surprised when these fiery ordeals come upon you. For everyone who walks in this way is going at some level or another to suffer, all of which began to raise for me this week, early in the week, a question. The question is this, and for me it's a very personal question, and I'm just going to kind of spread it out to all of us. But the question was this, Dave, so what were you expecting? When you signed on for this Jesus journey, for this rabbi's way of living and loving and being, what kind of life did you expect? Which in some ways is a bit of an odd question when I ask it of myself, because, you know, what did you expect? I was 10, you know, when I signed on. And I didn't really know what it would cost me. It wasn't in my mind. Somebody told me if I accepted Jesus, I wouldn't go to hell. Good deal. What were you expecting? Particularly if you were serious. I'm assuming you were and are serious about following the rabbi's way of living and loving, of being, and of embracing as your own his mission and his message of a kingdom that quite clearly we've come to understand was confronting and seeking to subvert just by the nature of what his kingdom is. It was going to and does confront and subvert every other kingdom, be it religious kingdoms or political kingdoms or even our own personal kingdoms, which means from time to time if we move in the realities of this kingdom. We're going to be in conflict with these other kingdoms. So what were you expecting that to feel like, to look like, to result in, in your actual life? And part of the reason I'm asking that question is because of another question that this final beatitude early in the week began to stir in me. The question was this, so what were they expecting when they signed on for this Jesus journey for this rabbi's way of living and loving and being? What kind of life did they expect when they said yes to his mission and his message? By they, I mean that little group of 12 young boys about to become men. How much that they would suffer, how much that it could cost to follow, not just to accept Jesus as their Savior. Jesus didn't on the hillside go, would you accept me here? It wasn't even about that. Sure, that's part of it. But for following his way, how much that it could cost them, how much that they might suffer. See, I just wonder if they knew that if they did what Jesus did and said what Jesus said, particularly to the kind of people he said, and did what he said and did to religious people who were full of dead men's bones, exposed them as such, and powerful people who were oppressing the poor and others like them. I wonder if they knew that they would get what Jesus got because the disciple is not above his teacher. So what were they expecting? When they signed on for this Jesus journey, this rabbi's way, what were you expecting? Because you know what else this makes me wonder is I really get the picture of what it was really like that day and where it really led them in their actual lives. It makes me wonder if Jesus were here today in the flesh saying what he said and doing what he did and then we saw him talking to our kids. I have kids, the disciples age, you know, and if he was really here now talking to our kids, my kids on the side of some hill, would any of you let them follow him? In my mind, every instinct, maybe you have, is like, of course, of course, it's my dream as a father to see my children follow Jesus. In fact, one of the best memories I have of my life is when little Tommy accepted Jesus as his, I didn't say accept him. I said follow him. And what if in their following him, you lost him? Oh, Dave, this is a little far-fetched. I mean, this isn't first century Rome. I know. And that probably is a little far-fetched. But it's weird. Two weeks ago today, my brother's son, my brother Steve's son, his name is Cornell, he's a sophomore at Bethel University. Cornell, two weeks ago today, got off a plane in Kenya. And I'll never forget, I opened the paper last Sunday knowing he was either in the air or already there. And it was the day, it was the day, all those riots in Kenya started. We weren't quite frantic. We were certainly concerned. Folk calls back and forth. Did he get there? Is he still in the air? Is he stuck in London? And if he did get there, is he okay? I found out he was okay and got to the people he needed to connect with. A week ago today, I got an email from Cornell. And among the things his email said was this. I have the email in my hands. Uncle Dave. He says a number of things. And, you know, again, what I love about these disciples is how young they were. So his first paragraph is how glad he is he didn't get the runs. So anyway, okay, good. Thanks for sharing, Cornell. That's good. Then he says this. Then he says this. In spite of the terrible things that have been going on around me, I have an amazing opportunity to see how church leaders are dealing with the injustice that is besetting the people of Kenya. The response has been one of strength and decisiveness. Instead of staying behind the security blanket of Jesus, the churches of Kenya are uniting under the banner of social justice. Here's a kid, my nephew, who cares about it. When did you learn about this? They're confronting head-on the evil of tribal divisions and violence. This morning, I want to go to this church. This morning at the church I attended, I witnessed the embrace of sworn enemies united under the love of God in a way that pledged the end of the malice and hate that has plagued the people of Kenya since its beginnings as a country. Only the love of Christ can overcome the inherent hatred that has been fostered by their culture for generations. In the paraphrased words of Dallas Willard, he got that book from me. From the forward of the spear of the disciplines, he never got past the forward. Yes, he did. The only kind of revolution that will ever have any effect on our world is a spiritual revolution. Cornell's joined the revolution. Across the country, he goes on to say, Christians have banded together in an effort to aid those affected by this violence. Kikuyu and Lu'o tribes alike are joining sides under the banner of Christ and giving what little they have to help those less fortunate than they are. Over the next few weeks, I will be given the opportunity to serve refugees from across Kenya who have fled their cities in fear for their lives to the safer neighborhoods of southern Nairobi. On top of the service that we have pledged to the local orphanages, I will be certain that the next few weeks will be full indeed. Do you wonder if we're proud of this kid? The oldest was probably Peter. You might remember this from the early research we did in this series on the rabbi and found out about Bet Sefer and Bet Talmud and Bet Midrash and kind of did the math, figuring that these people following this rabbi were probably in their late teens, early 20s. I picture them in my mind like college kids that might help you to do the same. When the rabbi said to them, Lechacharai, come, follow me, they did. And when he went up on the mountain in chapter 5, verse 1, and he sat down, these guys came to him, greener than green. Try to picture it in your minds. Some of them weren't shaving yet, still had pimples on their face, but eager to please and willing to follow this rabbi anywhere. And opening his mouth in chapter 5, verse 2, he began to teach them, saying, blessed are the poor in spirit. Really. And those who mourn. And it's the meek who inherit the earth. And by this time, you know, they're pretty sharp guys, so they knew enough about this rabbinic style of teaching that was Jesus' style of teaching as well to know that these rabbis speak in riddles. It's what they do to make us think, to help us grow. So how it is that the meek actually do inherit the earth, We have no clue, but as his Talmudim, we just kind of understand that it's our job to figure that out, to think a little deeper and to wonder a little more. These great reversal themes that we became familiar with when we began the Beatitudes that Jesus was so fond of using, rooted as they were in the rabbinic tradition, where he would over and over change the order of things like good rabbis always did, did thereby, however, for his purposes, to give voice to the upside-down realities of the kingdom of God, where the first would be last, K, and the last would be first, whatever. But none were more upside-down, more out of order, as it were, relative to how we normally think about life and what we want from life and what we expect from God to do for us, quite frankly, then this eighth and final beatitude, beginning in the 10th verse with these words, blessed are those of you who have been persecuted precisely because you did the right thing, the righteous thing, not the self-righteous thing, which so many of us are known for and ought to get persecuted for, like the Pharisees who we've met on many occasions who polish the outside of the cup and of the bowl in order to look righteous. But inwardly, they actually despise other people who aren't as bright and shiny as they are. They wouldn't touch a leper if their life depended on it, let alone love a leper, because they were full of robbery and self-indulgence, even though on the outside, bright and shiny, clean. No, it's not who I'm talking about, says Jesus, but blessed are you. When born of authentic moral virtue, on the inside you've developed this insatiable thirst, hunger and thirst for what we called a few weeks ago when we dealt with the fourth beatitude in verse 6, restorative justice, Because that's what righteousness is when you are hungry and thirsty and you just can't get enough. You're never satisfied with the process of bringing those things which are wrong into a place where they are right, where bringing those who are far off and bringing them near those cut off to be included, those untouchable to be embraced. So if you're persecuted for doing that, and you will be, primarily by religious people. Don't worry, says Jesus, because yours is the kingdom of heaven and blessed are you when your attempts to bring peace where there is no peace, to speak truth where there is no truth, and you do it not by picking up a sword, by screaming and yelling and demanding your rights, but by picking up a cross and laying down your rights, but the whole time speaking the truth, you'll never be more vulnerable than that. Which, by the way, is what Steve Wings talked about last week. Remember when he said that if we're going to lift peace up, we're going to have to lay some things down. Well, if because of that men cast insults at you, verse 11, and persecute you, saying all sorts of things about you that aren't true. They speak evil against you falsely. And here's the key. On account of me, and I don't mean account of because you wore your Jesus T-shirt to school. On account of following his way, and not because you're being all odd for God, do you wonder if we're praying for this kid every day, several times a day? And among the things I pray for him is that he would be safe, that God would protect him. An appropriate thing to pray, I think, when Peter was in prison, the whole church gathered praying for his safety. But what if he isn't? Instinctively, I don't know if you're saying this, but somebody is under their breath saying, don't say that, don't even think that. Well, I don't think that. Because I think he'll be okay. That's what I think. But I wonder about a lot of things. I do it all the time. It drives me crazy. And among the things I wonder is this, Dave. What were you expecting? When you said yes to this Jesus journey, to this rabbi's way, to this rabbi's way of living and loving. All of which pushes me past wondering to noticing that among the first things Jesus tells these raw recruits relative to expectations, I mean, he's telling them right off the bat. Here's what you should expect. some suffering and pain, persecution as well. Well, right off the bat, he tells them this. You don't get a free pass by following me, which I need to tell you, I think, is a stupid thing to tell them, especially this early on in the journey. I mean, honestly, I should tell them up early front. You'll go to heaven. It's all going to be great. Don't tell them this. And then, I mean, even from a marketing standpoint. I mean, seriously. This will never sell. We'll never fill the room. I mean, how are you going to get people to sign up? To come to our church, forget that, to become Christians. How are you going to get them to become, how are you going to get them to follow Jesus if you tell him to expect this. Which, by the way, is something we have figured out. Because the gospel that sells, particularly in America today, is the gospel of success. The gospel that promises in a variety of ways that if you follow Jesus, or at least put into play these five principles about Jesus, you'll be healthy, wealthy, and wise. You'll have a better life, a prettier wife, a bigger house, a nicer car. You'll even have better seats at concerts and first-class upgrades on airplanes, says the author of one of the best-selling Christian books in the country right now. Because if you do it right, you'll have a favor with God and man, and the proof of God's favor is comfort and success, a better life, a prettier wife. It's how we sell the gospel. it's how we get people to buy it but do you notice past wondering have you noticed how different Jesus' sales pitch was and is to these fresh faced eager to please kids who sat on the hillside that day and later he didn't stop in Matthew 8 this is one of my favorite stories I've told it often you know about this one, when that scribe came to him in Matthew 8 saying, teacher, rabbi, I will follow you wherever you go. Jesus said, great. He didn't blow him off, didn't confront, he just, great, I'm glad. The more the merrier. But just keep this in mind that foxes have holes and birds have nests. The Son of Man does not have a place to lay his head. And if you follow me, It might be that way for you. Guy disappears from verse 23 to 24. You never hear from him. How many of you know people? Oh, mercy. I'm serious. People who think they're being pure persecuted when what they're really being is weird or obnoxious and sometimes even mean and arrogant. And I'm going to tell you about... don't tell anyone that you know him. But, because this is so serious, in fact, that kind of stuff so diminishes the power of what Jesus is talking about. Because if you are, in fact, being lied about and slandered on account of him, and on account of the fact that you really are following his way of living, and loving and caring for the least and the lost and bringing peace where there is no peace and truth where there is no truth, but not by yelling and screaming, but by laying down your rights and picking up a cross, then rejoice and be glad. For your reward in heaven is great, which is great, but it feels like you're going to have to wait for heaven. For in exactly the same way, they persecuted the prophets who were before you. And in this context, the word persecuted means killed. Because they killed the prophets who were before you. Which is exactly what Jesus says in Matthew 23, 23. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her. All of which brings me back to this original question that stirred in me when I started considering this beatitude. The question is this, so what were you expecting? When you signed on for this Jesus journey, for this rabbi's way of living and loving, what kind of life were you expecting? What were they expecting? And then these questions really do make me wonder a number of things as I recreate the story and the scene, and I hope you can do the same in your mind as I have in my mind. You see, I wonder if he knew. and right now I mean Jesus himself as he looked into these eyes of these fresh faced kids on the side of the hill that day picture them you just need to do this I know you can picture them they're so eager to please they'd barely begun this journey with Jesus they were saying yes they didn't know what it meant or what it would cost but I wonder if he knew when he said to them blessed are those of you how much it would actually cost them to follow in his way, how much they would actually suffer that Peter, that brash young kid, he was one of those 12 that day on the hillside. I mean, Peter was the kind of guy, you could see him across the room with a group of his friends and you'd pick up. He's the leader. I mean, these people, they laugh at his jokes. They just fought. He's obnoxious beyond belief. The apostle with the foot shape. mouth is Peter. And I wonder if Jesus knew that day as he was saying these things that one day he would be crucified upside down for righteousness sake. Because Peter had this relentless desire, his hunger and thirst to see what was wrong be made right, to see those far off be brought near, or that James, the brother of John, they were both on the hillside that day, would one day be beheaded. because he kept trying to bring peace where there was no peace and speak truth where there was no truth, but not by yelling and screaming and picking up a sword, but by laying it down and picking up a cross. I wonder if he knew. Or Philip, the tender-hearted one. Everybody knew that about Philip. He would cry at the drop of a hat. He brought wounded birds, you know, to be healed. That one day, Philip, according to legend, would be forced later on in his life to watch his daughters be crucified before he was given the same. Indeed, all but one on the hillside died that way eventually, and the one who didn't would, in exile, die alone on an island called Patmos. His name was John. We're going to hear from him next week. So, John, what were you expecting? because back in Matthew 5 they were all just kids and it really makes me wonder if they knew again and I just love the the recruitment pitch if you will that Paul used with Timothy, Timothy this young guy who was by all accounts if you read 1 and 2 Timothy I mean you really need to read them as what they are personal letters it's almost like we found somebody's mail and stuck it in the Bible, you know, a letter encouraging Paul, the older guy, seasoned, writing to this young guy who was just entering into his life in the kingdom of God and his service therein in a church that was scary. Evil men and imposters are growing from bad to worse, says Paul, and these are the people in the church. And Paul's initiation, his recruitment pitch was this, 2 Timothy 2.2. Timothy, come suffer hardship with me. Come on. You'll love it. Philippians 129, For it has been granted to us, Timothy and whoever else chooses to follow, not only to believe in him, which is incredible, but it has been granted to us to suffer for his sake. So we got that going for us. Remember Paul's passion, and they may know him, the power of his resurrection, and to be part of the fellowship of men and women who have suffered on account of him. These people think differently than us. So what were you expecting? When you signed on for this Jesus journey, for this rabbi's way of living and loving and being, but with all of that swirling in your mind, let me try to bring it down, not down in a condescending way, but practical, to make this more practical, a little more realistic, a little more basic, because the fact is this. I don't think anybody here is going to be beheaded or crucified on account of Jesus. I'm just a wild guess. So let me make it more basic. What were you expecting when you said yes to that charming young man who wanted to be your husband or that beautiful young girl who wanted to be your wife. Remember the day you got married? It was all ha-cha-cha. Oh. But it was the weirdest thing because that girl, that guy, turned out to actually be a flawed human being. Who knew? You know, and then they were incapable of satisfying your every desire. just wasn't what you expected at all. And they were sometimes crabby and even sinful, downright sinful. And then they got old and wrinkly. I'm serious, not nearly as attractive. So what's going to keep me here now? Indeed, for many, their spouse doesn't need to be a flawed human being, just ordinary. to say, eh, not worth it. It's interesting, not interesting, very sad to me. Latest, this is the, this is a true story. The latest reason that I have heard for a couple in our church, I'm not our church for getting a divorce, is that we're just not the same people that we used to be. Priceless. Fact is, they've been married 10 minutes. What I mean by that is three years. You know, there's dog years, which is longer, married years. Three years is ten minutes. You haven't gotten wet yet. You're not even... You haven't suffered enough to learn what it means to love somebody yet. So what were you expecting? That's my question. That following the way of the rabbi would look like in your marriage. What were you expecting that following the way of this rabbi would look like in how you love your spouse? and what you do with things like vows. Stephan mentioned that this whole week we've been talking about this, because we do. I meet real early on Tuesday morning with some people and talk about where we're going and wondering where we're going. And so their message team on Wednesdays, we talk about this stuff. And it's just an amazing process to kind of get everybody dialing in and thinking and wondering together and has an amazing effect on me in terms of what I can even bring. But later in the day on Wednesday, after we talked about this at length at Message Team, I was talking to Terry Steinmeier, who's on the Message Team, and he said, you know, Dave, as I think about it, part of the problem is that culture always wins. I was intrigued by that statement, and what do you mean by that? And he went on to tell me about how a few years previous, he said how disturbed he got when he had heard at one time that there were some Haitian Christians who still practiced voodoo. And this was just kind of in the bank of his memory. And he said, when he first heard that, he was just appalled by that and disturbed by that. Thinking, how in the world could you call yourself a Christian and practice voodoo at the same time? How can you mix those messages? How could you not see the inconsistency there? And again, he was kind of stepping back like I would and did when he told me this, questioning whether they even get the real deal like we do. and then in his own process as he was sharing that with me what the conclusion he came to was the reason they stuck with voodoo was because voodoo is so strong in that culture I mean it's just in the pores and culture wins what's the point? the point is this well we're all indignant and appalled by some Christian Haitians who dabble in voodoo and it is appalling we have a Christianity that pretty much promises the American dream that if you follow Jesus you'll have a better life, a prettier wife because at the end of the day the culture wins but what if you don't have an easier life and a prettier wife when you followed the rabbi's way Indeed, what if you suffered precisely because you did what was right for following his way? What if for following his way, you didn't get richer? You got poorer. Because following his way actually even affected the career he chose. Not slamming anybody's career. Or you got poorer, not richer, because you gave so much away, precisely because you were following this rabbi. Fascinating story. I'll close with this, wrap it up with this. In Acts chapter 8. I'll never forget the first time I preached this. It's weird. I don't know why I remember certain things. Even, you know, there are certain teachings you remember, but I remember where I was. I remember in Robbinsdale. I remember Dave Busby was still alive because this thing so affected me. I called him, and we were both going, I don't get it. I don't get it. But Acts chapter 8, Acts chapter 8, the church is in its infancy, just been bored. The Spirit has just come, and because they're in their infancy, you'd think, and it's true, they're very vulnerable. Little babies, you got to protect them. And while some wonderful things were happening, as you well know about the beginning of the church, the Spirit fell in amazing ways. They were paying at the beginning a horrible price for all these wonderful things that were happening. Stephen had just been stoned to death. It says in Acts chapter 7, Saul, who would later become known as Paul, believe it or not, was in Acts chapter 8 giving hearty approval. He was kind of the guy in charge. Yeah, you can stone him. No, you can't stone him. He said, yeah, you can stone him, which meant it It was open season on Christians in Acts chapter 7, bleeding then into Acts chapter 8, so that on that day that Saul gave hearty approval to kill Steve and a great persecution arose against the whole church in Jerusalem. They were all scattered throughout the region, meaning they are leaving their homes of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles were staying in Jerusalem. And some devout men who were left in Jerusalem took Stephen's body and buried him, making loud lamentation over him, because blessed are those who mourn. But Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house, dragging off men and women, putting them into prison. Therefore, what's the therefore there for? Because of all of that stuff, those who had been scattered went about, and the interesting word there I put in quotes on the screen is, They went about good-newsing. The Greek word there is euangelizo. They went about good-newsing. And that was the word that I called Busby about and says, what in the world? Because when I read they went about good-newsing, having been driven from their homes, when I read that through the grid of my expectations about what you get when you follow God, makes me wonder, what was the good news that they were sharing, that they were giving so that people would join them. I mean, hey, everybody, we have no homes. We've lost it all. Our friends are in jail, and some of them are dead. Want to join? They did. They did want to join. Philip then stood and took the place of Stephen, and he began to preach, and the spirit began to fall and it says right in the middle of verse 8 that right in the middle of all of this turmoil there was great rejoicing in that city. Rejoice and be glad. All of which makes me wonder, what did they see that I don't see? And that's when I talk about Colin Busby that's why I talk to him. I says, Dave, these people had different expectations than me and you. What did they know that we don't know? Well, next week, I want to unpack some of that, what they saw, because to really enter into this, there are some things I think we need to know and things we need to see. Among the things we need to see is something that they saw, and we need to see it afresh, and that is Jesus. That is Jesus. You're going to need to see Jesus to count these things as joy. So next week, we're going to see Jesus the way John, remember the one who ended in exile? We're going to see Jesus the way John saw him while he was in exile, and it'll help you the way it helped him. But I did this weird thing this week relative to Acts chapter 8. I began to imagine. I have this bizarre imagination. Enter into this with me. I began to imagine actually asking these Acts 8 people how they did it. How did you go about good-newsing when I'd have been so grumpy? I promise you. Where is God? Where is God? Okay. and rejoicing. How did you do that? And in this imaginary conversation, I imagined them turning to answer my question with a question of their own, as if they were a people from another culture wanting to understand ours. I was wanting to understand theirs. They were wanting to understand ours. And the question they asked me was this, Dave, what were you expecting? When you said yes to this Jesus journey to this rabbi's way, what kind of life did you expect? And then in this goofy imagination of mine, I heard them say to me, Dave, I know we kind of confuse you, but you confuse us. Have you no scar? And what I'm reading here, I still imagine coming from these Acts 8 people, but Amy Carmichael actually wrote these words. Have you no scar? No hidden scar on foot or side or hand? I hear you sung as mighty in the land. I hear them hail your bright ascendant star. Which is okay. But where's your scar? Have you no wounds? Yet I was wounded by the archers spent, leaned me against the tree to die, and rent by ravenous beasts that compassed me, I swooned. Have you no wound? Just confusing. No wound, no scar? Yes, as the master, so shall the servant be, and pierced are the feet that follow me, but yours are whole. Can he have followed very far? Who has no wound? Who has no scar? Oh, wait. They said. You do have some scars. I didn't see them there. I see them there. And more than one I see. Then, blessed are you. Rejoice. and be glad. But what were you expecting? Let's pray as we close. For eyes to see and ears to hear and feet that swiftly follow you, we pray. And all God's people said. Thank you.
