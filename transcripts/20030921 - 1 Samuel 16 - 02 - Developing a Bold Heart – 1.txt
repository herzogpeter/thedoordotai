Using the story of David, found in 1 and 2 Samuel as a sort of guide, we began last week what we are referring to now as a journey of the heart. A journey whose aim it is to help us become more and more the kind of people who are the kind of people who are living authentically from the heart. But to do that, we discovered last week, many of us need to recover and reclaim our heart, to fight for our heart. Others, maybe for the first time, need to discover their heart, thus what we're calling a journey of the heart. First step on the journey. This week, again using the story of David, it's 1 Samuel chapter 17, maybe the most familiar of all the David stories. It's the story of David and Goliath where we are going to discover and examine what it looks like to have a bold and courageous heart, but in the very same story, we're also going to discover and examine what it looks like to lose heart, to have a failing heart, To have lost heart. With that thought in mind, just check out this video very quickly. I'm going to play a little bit. the obvious point of that little spot is that nobody sets out with those kinds of goals nobody sets out with those kinds of desires but you wake up one day and there you are a yes man a yes woman yes sir coming sir anything for a raise or i'll sell my soul for a raise sir when i grow up i want to be a brown nose no you didn't that was never your heart. So what happened? Well, the most obvious answer to that, maybe the most accurate answer to that, at least for some of us, is simply this. Life happened. But life came in the form, often, of a great, big, intimidating, hostile, scary obstacle called Goliath. Goliath, who at one time in your life you might have faced down. At one time in your life you might have gone toward an attack, but not today. Today you're tired. And you have reason to be in for a long time. This Goliath you're facing is not the first Goliath you've ever faced. If it was the first Goliath you've ever faced, you'd have lots of energy. But there have been many Goliaths before the one you're facing now. War, weary, you've lost heart. 1 Samuel 17, beginning in verse 4, we meet Goliath. And he is a big, strong, frightening, hostile, arrogant adversary. He wants your life. He wants your job. He wants your family. He wants your house. He wants you. He wants to take you out. A few weeks ago, we were, in the context of the Lord's Prayer, wrapping it up, dealing with the issue of spiritual warfare and the fact that we have an adversary. The prayer was this, lead us not into perasmas, into trials that can take us out, but deliver us from specifically the evil one. And we talked about the fact that the evil one is a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. And among other things, what he wants, the evil one, is to intimidate you, to accuse you, and then to entice you into despair so you will lose heart. Talked about spiritual warfare. Well, Goliath isn't spiritual. Goliath is a little bit different, and it's a paradigm you need to let into all of the things we deal with in life. Goliath is a physical problem. I can see Goliath. I can name him. I can say that in some ways easier because you can see Goliath. because you can at least identify the problem. It's right over there. It's your boss. You can see him. It's your job. It's your spouse. You can see him or her. It's your teenagers. It's your parents. You can look right at them, which in some ways makes it easier. You know, spiritual warfare, one of the problems with spiritual warfare is that sometimes we're involved in spiritual warfare and it takes three weeks for us to figure that that's what's going on because you can't always see it. When you got a Goliath, that's not the problem, and in some ways that makes it better. In some ways that makes it worse. You know why? For the same reason. You can see it. You can name it. You can identify it. And what you see real clearly is this. It's big. It's strong. It's hostile. It's real. And it's not going away. Verse 4. 1 Samuel 17. His height was six cubits in a span. That's nine feet, nine inches tall. That's just below the basket of a basket. That's incredible. He doesn't even have to jump to slam dunk. This guy's a first-round draft choice in the NBA, first-round draft choice in the NFL. Any position he wants, this guy's big. More recent scholarship, born of archaeological digs, speculates that he wasn't nine foot nine. He was closer to seven feet tall. Well, that's much better. it doesn't matter at all at all either way you got a big problem and it's not going away verse five he had a bronze helmet on his head and he was clothed with scale scale armor which weighed 5,000 shekels of bronze 5,000 shekels of bronze about 125 pounds that was his armor that weighs more than some of you he also had bronze greaves on his legs i'm not sure what those were. I'm picturing them like shin guards, hockey player. A bronze javelin slung between his shoulders and the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam and the head of his spear weighed 600 shekels of iron. The head of his beam, 25 pounds. That hits you. It's going to hurt. Okay. His shield carrier also walked before him. Now, picture this Goliath. Goliath. If all he did was stand there, that would be scary enough. But he doesn't do that. He starts to talk. In fact, this is the first example, I suppose, in history of trash talk. In fact, we're going to find out that trash talk is biblical. So guys, this is okay, because later on David's going to do it too. So trash talk is, okay. But he doesn't just stand there. He talks and he taunts and he challenges the armies of the living God. And the challenge was this. Look at verse 8. End of verse 8. Pick it up there. Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me. If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will become your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then I shall become, then you shall become our servants and serve us. Just note something here. This is all about becoming enslaved. This is all about fighting for freedom. And it's not just a physical freedom, not in terms of the analogy and where this is going in the kingdom of God. This is about whether you and I are going to live as slaves, or you and I are going to live as free men and women in the kingdom of God. That's what this battle is about. Not just David and Goliath, but in metaphor, our battle of life and our battle for our hearts. Now, this battle went on. It says, again, in verse 10, it says, again, the Philistine said, I defy the ranks of Israel this day. give me a man that we may fight together. This battle went on for 40 days. It says that in verse 16. It's interesting. It says, the Philistine came forward morning and evening for 40 days. Here's the picture. Every day, several times a day, the armies of God would come out to do battle. Goliath would come out to challenge and taunt. Then Saul and his army would cower and run. It was like a drill. They did it every day. They did it several times a day. Verse 11 says this, when Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid. Verse 24, when the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from him greatly afraid. It happened every day several times a day. And every day it happened, and every time it happened, the armies of the living God felt a little smaller, they got a little weaker, they felt a little more like cowards than they did the day before until they had developed what Eugene Peterson calls in this book I've been recommending for you to be reading as we go through this called Leap Over a Wall, what he calls a God, a Goliath-dominated imagination. Now we're gonna meet David over the next couple weeks in the context of a time in his life when he had a God-dominated imagination, but the armies of the living God, if that were to be the metaphor for the church, the church at this time has a Goliath-dominated imagination, and they're living in fear. Peterson calls this a Goliath sickness of the soul people of God throughout the ages have been afflicted with this disease from time to time numbers 13 we made mention of this some weeks ago spies came back from spying out the land 10 came back with this report you remember it well we are not able to go against these people. They are too strong for us. They are people of great size, and we are like grasshoppers in our own sight. It's a disease of the soul brought on by a Goliath dominated imagination. For some of us, this Goliath dominated imagination has become a way of life. It's a pattern of life, and if for you it has become a pattern of life, you have the disease. Some of you know people who live their entire lives this way. For some people, sad to say, I think there is a cure, but for some people this Goliath-dominated imagination is a terminal disease. You live that way, you die that way, you never come out of it. For others, and I think maybe, I would hope for more than a few, it's more like the flu. I catch the flu from time to time of a God, of a Goliath-dominated imagination. And what it has the power to do is ruin a weekend here and there when I get overwhelmed by the Goliath in my life. But it really isn't the way you live. In either case, whether you have the disease or you're struggling with the flu, when you get afflicted with this problem, you tend to act a lot like Saul, who was not in denial about this Goliath problem. He saw it every day. He heard it every day. He experienced it every day. And he wasn't so naive as to believe that Goliath was just going to go away. He knew it wasn't going to. It was there for 40 days, every day, a couple times a day. After 40 days, you're pretty convinced, this is kind of the way we're living right now. What Saul had fallen into was this pattern. I'm not in denial. I'm not naive that it's going to go away. I'm not attacking it either. I'm not facing it. I'm just hoping it stays over there. And this isn't in the text, and we don't hear him saying this, and I don't know if he said it, but it's almost as if the posture of Saul and his army was basically this. Let him yell. Let him scream. Here's some earplugs. try not to upset him. Let's tippy-toe around him, but don'y confront him. Don't face him down. Don't attack, because if we do what you have to do to a Goliath, and you know what you haveと do to a Goliath? You have to face him down. You have to attack. You have to confront. You have to deal with Goliath, but if we do what you have to Do to a Goliath, someone could get hurt. You might even die. you might lose your job if we attack the Goliath so we just hope it stays over there we don't want to do what you do because because you might have some unpleasantness if you attack your Goliath you might you might risk a relationship you might end up having an argument with your spouse if you quit ignoring what's going on in your marriage and you start going toward what's going on in your man. You might end up having tension. Oh my. You might upset your parents. You might alienate your kids. Nothing worse than that. So you spend your life dealing with the Goliaths of your life, not in denial. You know they're there. You hear them every day. You see them every day. They affect you every day. But you never go toward them. You never really deal with them. You just hope they stay over there. let me tell you something there is something worse than what could happen when we attack our goliaths because what could happen is that you die let me tell you what's worse than that the feeling that comes when you get a little weaker every day the feeling that comes when you get a little smaller every day the feeling that comes when you feel a little bit more like a coward every day till before you know it, you've lost heart. Enter now David, verse 12. Now David was the son of the Ephrathite of Bethlehem and Judah, whose name was Jesse, and he had eight sons. And Jesse was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men. And the three older sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle. And the names of the three sons who went to the battle were Eliab, the firstborn, and the second to him, Abinadab, and the third Shammah, and David was the youngest. We met David last week, discovered that whatever else marked David's life, he was marked primarily by this, he had a great heart. He was a man after God's own heart. Indeed, it was because of his heart that he was selected by God to be king after Saul. But he would not ascend to the throne for several years. He was still just a kid watching sheep and not ready for prime time player if there ever was one, but he could run errands. So basically, sheep and errands. We will trust David with that. So his father sends him on an errand after he had been watching the sheep. Verse 17, the errand is basically this. Here, David, bring this food to your brothers, and then the second part of the earth is come back to me with word of how the battle is delivering his taunts. Verse 24, then all of the men of Israel fled from him greatly afraid. David walks in just when they're doing the drill. When they're doing the thing they do every day. Goliath comes out and goes, and everybody else runs away. Verse 25, while the men were running away, David's just standing there watching, the men of Israel said to David, have you seen this man who's coming up? Because I don't know if this is true, but in my mind, the only possible explanation in these guys' minds for why David wasn't running was that he just didn't know how bad things were, how big he is. Did you see him? You ever run into anybody like that? I mean, it's like, the only reason you're not as upset as they are is that you just don't know how bad things are. And they just give you all the bad news about life and their life and by the end of it, you're convinced, you know, yeah, we're all going to die. Be afraid. Be very afraid is the spirit that comes out of this army then david said verse 26 basically my paraphrase okay he's big but what will be done for the guy who takes him out in that question is an assumption somebody's going to take him out i mean obviously you know just waiting for who that will be then he says what is kind of a famous line ascribed to david when he says this For who is this uncircumcised Philistine who is defying the armies of the living God? Who does this guy think he is, said David. Freeze frame it right there. The battlefield, it's hot, it's dusty. These guys have been there for a while. Along comes David. Who does this guy think he is? Let me ask you a question. Do you think it's at all possible that while David was wondering aloud in front of everyone, who does this guy think he is, that a few of the soldiers, maybe just a couple, were wondering themselves about David? Who do you think you are? Who are you? We've been out here for a while. What? Where'd you come from? The response, I don't think, not like Eliab. in verse 28, let's look at what Eliab says to his younger brother, spoke to, when he heard David speak to the men, Eliab's anger burned against David and said, why have you come down? And with whom have you left the few sheep in the wilderness? You couldn't do the one little thing you were supposed to do. I know your insolence, your arrogance, I know the wickedness of your heart, for you have come down just to see the battle. We're going to come back to Eliab, but the people I'm asking you to wonder about aren't as angry and spiteful as Eliab? Do you think it's possible that from their perspective, not angry and spiteful, but from their perspective of having been in the battle for a while, they weren't entirely appreciative, maybe a little resistant to David's unbridled energy and impatient indignation that nothing was being done. Verse 25, verse 26, David says, what will be done? Verse 27, they said, we already told you in verse 25. Think they'd be a little impatient, maybe? Especially if the warrior looked a little bit like somebody out of a Braveheart movie, long beard, full armor, grizzled, sweaty, dirty, a little bloody, seasoned, kind of got a no-nonsense look on his face, And David shows up, never been in battle before, shows up looking like Ferris Bueller on his day off. I mean, how open would you be to receiving his challenge? I challenge you. Just for a moment, be one of those war-weary soldiers. You know, David, we're kind of up to our elbows in alligators here, and we've been that way for a while. 40 days, every day, all day long. And this guy's not the first formidable foe we've ever had to face. You know, I'm sure you're all excited because you're seeing this Goliath and I was too on my first, but we've been doing this a while. So where'd you come from? Hmm. Tending sheep. That's good. You can learn a lot being a shepherd. You really can. But you haven't been here. You haven't got reaction on anybody's part as possible in this scenario. It's not in the text. Just wondering. This would be a good point to ask yourself a question. Do you find yourself identifying in the story right now? Do you find your heart identifying more with the energy of David? Some of you do. Go there. Or do you find yourself identifying a little bit more with the war-weary people? The reason I'm asking you the question, there's not a right or wrong answer. The reason I'm answering you the question is work you have to do because it'll tell you a little bit about where you are in this journey of the heart. And you know what? To do this journey well, you need to identify that. I don't want to take this too far in this speculation, but you know what I think David needed here? And David does really well here. David is clearly the hero of the story, but I think he needed something here. It's the kind of thing that the Davids of the world need. And by the way, I just want to make something clear, and I'm not going to clarify this all the way through here anymore, but David is a masculine name. When I speak of the Davids of the world, I am speaking not of men. I am speaking of young men and young women. When I speak of fathers, I am speaking of men and women who function in the role of a father. When I speak of kings, it is men and women. When I speak of warriors, it is men and women. here's what David needed at this place David needed a big brother he needed a big brother right now really bad but he didn't need one like Eliab who had a jealous heart you know what David needed here really bad in this scene in fact in scenes to follow as well David really needed a father, but not like Jesse, who couldn't even see his own son's heart. David really needed a king, but not like Saul, who himself had already lost heart. You know what David needed? David desperately needed an elder. He needed a veteran, a man or a woman who could put his or her arm around this boy and say, among other things, this, boy, I need to tell you some things. You have an amazing gift from God. You have an authentic anointing, and God is all over your life. And every single thing you said on that battlefield today was right and true and good. And you know what else, boy? It needed to be said. That army needed to hear the words you had from you. But a father, a king, an older brother would also say this. David, don't write off all those guys as washed up has-beens and faithless cowards. You need to realize that they've been in this battle for a very long time. And they don't all have the disease. Some of them do. But they don't all have the disease. Some of them just have the flu. Word to David. Word to the Davids among us, the young men and women who've got the energy. A little patience, respect for the war-weary soldiers who've been facing down Goliaths for a very long time. Before you discard them, Before you think you can fix them, maybe you should thank them. But now a word to the war-weary soldiers. Before you look at the Davids of the world and go, you punk, who, who, you riding on your bike? Were you born 20 seconds ago? I mean, we've been in this for a while. Before you blow off the Davids, war-weary ones, wonder with me, about this. What would you give to have a heart like that kid again? Do you remember your heart? You know, when I think of what I consider to be the normal cycle, it is actually in my personal life, it is the expected cycle of spiritual formation and growth. The expectation that I have of myself and of you is this, that the older we get, the more mature, formed, and godly we will become. I think that's the... When I'm an adult, I put away childish things. I want to walk away from some of those childish things. Paul says, though the outer man is decaying, I get older and older. I get in touch with my physical limitations. But one of the incredible things of this journey of the heart is this. The inner man, the inner woman, can be growing day by day. That's my expectation about my life and yours in this journey of the heart. But every once in a while, often in the context of a 40-day ordeal with some Goliath, I need to remember some things that I knew when I was 20, but I forgot. I need to remember some things that I knew when I was 16, about giving myself away to something that was bigger than me, about believing God no matter what, about recognizing that Goliath is big, but God is bigger. Things I knew when I was 20, that even though all I have is five little stones, what are they? My stupid, puny little guests against a giant like that. when I was 16, when I was 20, I knew that if even that was all I had, here's the deal, I'm going to throw these five stones as hard as I can because I would rather die than live as a slave to fear. I knew some of that when I was 20. And when I remember that, this is not magic wand stuff. But when I remember that heart, I begin to recover my heart. Because it really is my heart. And it really is your heart. I begin to, when I remember my own heart, begin to recover my believing heart, my good heart, my brave heart. Point number one. In developing a bold heart. In recovering a bold heart. again this is not this is just one little piece this is going to be a very long journey but one of the pieces that you're going to need to develop this heart recover this heart is to remember remember the video the brilliance of that video where we see these kids saying I want to grow up to be a brown noser the brilliance of that video spot is that when we were kids we didn't talk that way I know what I want to do when I grow up I want to be a yes man I know what I want to be I want to be an avoider. I want to sit like this my whole life. What did you want to be? Do you remember? I don't mean I wanted to be a fireman. I didn't mean I wanted to be a baseball player. That's not what I mean. I don't care about the little thing you had like that. Do you remember something much more? Do you remember your heart? You had a great heart when you were David. It's time to recover your heart. It's time to remember your heart. And some of you had it when you were 12. We need to enter into this war for our hearts for a number of reasons. We need to remember our hearts for a number of reasons. One is this. You need to remember your own heart and recover it for yourself. You need to do it for yourself, for your own experience of your own life. Because here is the truth. A life lived in fear is no life at all. But there is another reason, war-weary ones, that you need to remember and recover your heart. We need to do it for the Davids. because Davids need kings who haven't lost their hearts. Explain what I mean by that. We are talking a lot here at Open Door these days, behind the scenes, and I think it comes into the pulpit. I guess I'm not conscious of how much it is. I talk about this stuff so much, I don't know if it's in the pulpit or if it's always at these meetings. I'm at, but we are talking a lot these days about identifying and calling out and giving the ministry away to the next generation, about identifying the Davids among us, the young men and women among us, and blessing them, equipping them, and releasing them into ministry. And there are a number of things we need to do that. We need to intentionally open some doors of opportunity to them. I think you probably noticed that there's a pretty significant number of Davids, young men and women on our worship team. Some of you may not like that. I don't care. That we are led in worship by Davids. I love that. They're not just men. They're young men, young women. And they're not all young. I mean, some of them are old like Bruce. But, you know, the thing that David needs, it's much bigger than a program. To call out the next generation, you need much more than program. You need some tangible things. But I'll tell you what, if the next generation is going to authentically be called out, that next generation needs kings, men and women, who haven't lost their heart. It's one of the reasons we're fighting for some of your hearts right now. fight for your heart for you, and we're fighting for your heart for our children and for our children's children, because our children need fathers and mothers and need big brothers and need kings who haven't lost their heart, because if you've lost your heart, you can't call anything out of anybody else. Earlier in the talk, he indicated that David needed a big brother, not like Eliab, who had a jealous heart. A little flash for you. There is no shortage of Eliabs in the world. This is just going to be some straight talk about life here. There is no shortage of Eliabs in the church. I'm very sad about that, but that is the truth. Eliabs are in the church. Eliabs whose arrows of criticism can pierce the heart in ways more damaging, sometimes even than Goliath's spear. We're all geared up to go get Goliath. You need to understand that sometimes the thing that knocks you out is Eliab's, your brother. His word. Notice where Eliab aimed his arrow, his word. Verse 28. I know your insolence and the wickedness of your what? Heart. He aimed it right at his heart. This is incredible. Eliab's going, you have a wicked heart. Week before, and it wasn't a week before, but last week in our thing, God said to David, you're a man after my heart. You have a good heart. Who are you going to believe, David? There's a battle for your life right there. Who are you going to believe? most significant thing though is this Eliab's your brother this is a person close John Eldridge in this book again I've been recommending for you to be kind of looking through as we go through this series I think it'll dovetail a lot of things we're talking about called wake the dead says this the worst blows tend to come from those who know us well and should have loved us then in the book he tells a story of a German fable. It goes like this. It's about a Siegfried who was a great warrior, had a great heart, slew a terrible dragon, was fearless in battle. He was invincible except for a small place on his back between his shoulders. There he could be wounded. An uncle discovered Siegfried's weak spot and attacked him there, stabbed in the back by a friend. Eldred says that that tale lives on precisely because it's so often true. Let me tell you something about the Eliabs of the world. The reason Eliab was so angry at David, well, obviously he got passed by, but the anger grew. The real thing that was going on in this battlefield is that David's courage made Eliab's cowardice look as cowardly as it really was. see when the whole army was shut down being shut down looked normal you put one person into the mix where everybody's shut down who's alive and your life is going to make their death look as dead as it is and when you expose their death as being as dead as it is they will rise up and give you a hug thank you for sharing no they won't this is the same dynamic that Jesus ran into with the Pharisees I think that the primary reason the Pharisees hated Jesus is because his power made their impotence look as impotent as it was picture that in a church the whole church is just pathetically impotent somebody one person begins to move in some kind of authentic God power what the power does is it makes everybody's impotence, look as weak as it is, and everybody goes, thanks for sharing. They hate that. We're going to kill you. I know the wickedness of your heart. You got all sorts of bad motives. Here's the deal. This thing of the heart is going to be a battle. Because if you come to life in your family, in your workplace, in the church, you will unwittingly begin to expose everybody else's death. notice what David did this is great end of verse 29 you came down here just in order to see the battle David's response David said verse 29 what have I done now was it not just a question now this is just kind of a little brother old brother what did I do now I didn't ask a question actually in the Hebrew in the Hebrew the Hebrew word for that whole phrase actually it's pronounced this way nuh-uh You're not the boss of me. Now here's the significant thing about David's response. And it's incredible. You need to let this in. It says in verse 30, Then David turned away from him. Hear me. Turning away from the Eliabs in your life. And there are Eliabs in your life. There are Eliabs in the church. There are Eliabs in this church. Hope you leave. Or change. Maybe you'll recover your heart. But there are, we all have Eliabs. Turning away, ignoring your Eliabs. Now that does not mean you can ignore the wound. You've got to deal with the wound. And we need to go somewhere else for that. But ignoring the Eliabs of your life may be as important in this story as going toward your Goliaths in this whole process of recovering our hearts and building a bold heart. Back to the point. David needed a big brother, not like Eliab who had a jealous heart. David needed a father, Not like Jesse, who had a blind heart and couldn't see his own son's heart. David needed a king, rather. Not like Saul, who had already lost heart. And the reason David and the Davids of this world need those things is because warriors like David without kings are loose cannons. The reason the Davids of the world need those things is because energy, like David had, without wisdom is a fool. Put it this way in a little bit more bizarre analogy, the reason Davids need big brothers, fathers, kings, and wisdom is because masculinity without integrated femininity does not have the strength to go for the long haul. energy, and wisdom together sticks with it. Knows when to shoot the gun and when not to. There's a great scene in the movie, The Mask of Zorro. You know, I wasn't allowed to go to movies when I was a kid, so I'm making up for it. I just, it's all I do. That's not true. The scene has the old Zorro, played by Anthony Hopkins, sees the new Zorro, played by Antonio Banderas. The young Zorro, the new guy, doesn't know he's going to be the Zorro yet. And the young Zorro is about to confront the bad guy, the evil force, the villain, the Goliath. And he sees him coming into town, and he's drawing his sword, and he's going right for the guy when the old Zorro, Anthony Hopkins, grabs him, knocks him down, smacks him around, beats him up, laying on the ground, and then the old Zorro looks at the new and says, you can thank me now. For what? I was going to kill him. And by the way, let me just pause that for a second. This young Zorro, having just kind of been roughed up by the old Zorro, could have looked up at the old Zorro and said, you're just like Eliab. You're just like Saul. You're just like my dad. And could have ended up being a young fool. because I just know you're jealous of me and I got all this. And the old Zorro looked at the young Zorro and said, I didn't beat you up because I'm jealous, threatened, blind and I haven't resigned from the fight but I have some wisdom you don't have. See, you were not about to kill him. You were about to die. No doubt you would have fought bravely, he said and died quickly. And then they went into training. They went into the desert. And training in the desert is hard. And there were times in the desert that the David wonders if the king, the father, the older brother cares about him at all. But the desert is not designed to hinder David. The Davids of the world. It is designed to prepare them and then to release them. Here's my question. Where do the Davids of this world, the young men and women, learn that kind of stuff? Well, they're supposed to learn it from their kings and their fathers and their older brothers. They're supposed to learn it from the elders, from the veterans, men and women of experience. But they can only learn those things from the kings and the fathers and the warriors and the veterans who haven't lost their heart. So we're going to fight for your heart. And we're going to do it for you, and we're going to do it for our children, and our children's children, and our children's children's children. This is a very important fight. So here's the question. Do you remember your heart? Do you remember it before the string of Goliaths came your way? Before the 40 days of taunting and weariness of war came your way. Before the Goliath sickness of the soul set in. Do you have the disease? Or do you just have the flu? That would be, I think, an important thing to invite God into that question. God, do I have the disease? I need to cure. Do I just have the flu? Well, then you'll be done. It'll be over in the day. Nothing even to worry about. There's nothing even to take. You just got the flu. It'll be gone. but if I have the disease God you got to come in I need a cure in either case part of the cure might be to remember to remember some things you knew when you were David when you were young and stupid things about giving yourself to something that was bigger than you about living in a story that's bigger than yours about believing God no matter what about recognizing that Goliath is really big, but God's just bigger. Remember when you could see that? The fact is, maybe some of you can't remember. If that's the case, maybe you don't need a renewed heart. Maybe you need a new heart. I have a question for you. It's not very complicated. It's just this. want one? That's all. Would you like a new heart? Ezekiel 36, 26 says this. I'll give you a new heart, says the Lord. You want one? Is that what you want? This isn't rocket science here. What do you want? I will give you a new heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a new heart. You know what that is? In the Old Testament, that's the gospel. We say it here, it opened all the time. It's not just heaven when you die. That's not it. It's I will give you a new heart right here, right now, and you will come to life, and I will replace your heart of stone. I'm going to tell you something else. We are committed these weeks to fight for the heart. I am here to fight for your heart I want you to fight for my heart But here's the deal I'm going to get tired So are you You know who's fighting for you? You better know this God's fighting for your heart He is? He doesn't feel like it Okay, okay, okay God, who made the world, left heaven We talk about it I said this last week We talk a lot about original sin I want us to think about original glory And we lost it because of sin and then God says, I want their hearts back. So he sent his son and he died and he paid, and it was war to get your heart back, to bring us back to the glory we have been created for. He's fighting for your heart. So what do you need? What do you want? I want you to bow your heads right now. I'm going to bring you through. I just want us to enter into some prayer together. And I'll guide you through this. God's going to meet some of you right here, right now. I don't have to do anything weird. Just be with God. God, I pray we just invite you right now to come into this time of ministry and just come visit us, come be with us. Release your gifts, release your words. Give recovery, healing power. I pray for resurrection power. Let me speak first of all to those who need a new heart. Ask him for one. Boy, isn't this complicated. No, I'm not going to make you come forward, raise your hand. I don't care about any of that. You need a new heart? Right there, where you sit, I'm not kidding. Say something like this. Don't use my words. Use your words. But it's kind of like, Lord, that thing he said in Ezekiel 36 about a new heart. I can't even remember the verse, Lord. But if you really do that, I could use that. Give me a new heart. Come into my heart, Lord Jesus. Come in today. Come in to stay. And he will, right where you sit, need a renewed heart? Ask him right where you sit. Lord, help me to remember my good heart. Help me remember what I knew when I was David. Invite God into that cynical place. invite God into that Eliab place into that Jesse place who for some reason you can't see the heart of your own son and your own daughter invite God into that Saul place that isn't in denial you're not naive, the problem's not going away but you're just too scared to attack. The altar team will be here for people who need prayer and you need to go to. I would encourage some of you just to stay where you are and continue your business with God. We're not done with this story. There's some things to learn from a lion and a bear next week. There's things to learn about five smooth stones instead of small Saul's armor, but that can wait till next week. Today, it's enough to remember. God, bring to our hearts the things we need to know, things we need to recall as you continue this work of helping us recover our hearts and some of us get a brand new one. Pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
