As most of you know, this is the first week in a three-week seminar, and we're going to be dealing with the issue of divorce, marriage, divorce, and then remarriage. Those of you who come regularly, and I think most of you do, as I see your faces, are aware of the fact that this has been given birth from our morning expository study in the book of 1 Corinthians. As we came to the 7th chapter, specifically the area of the 8th verse and following into the 25th, as Paul began to deal specifically with the problem in that church of people who were married at one time, not married anymore, sometimes they were widows, sometimes they were divorced, then they got saved and they were coming with these questions, what do we do now? Is remarriage a possibility for us? Some people are telling us yes, some people are telling us no. What about divorce in general? Well, one of the things that happened was, as we studied that a couple of weeks ago, is that in the study itself, we began to be aware of the fact that this was really an immense issue. I had a sense, even as I was preaching, that I was giving way too much information on one particular Sunday morning for us to possibly absorb. Even from the feedback I got from some of you, that was kind of the feeling I think we all had. And also, when we come to the 10th verse in the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 7, One of the things that Paul does is he quotes Jesus, and he says this, but to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord. So what he's saying is what I'm about to say about marriage is not even my opinion. This is what God has said about marriage and divorce. And then he goes on to say that a man should not leave her husband. Yeah, I did that this morning, didn't I? That must be, maybe it's Freudian, I don't know. We don't believe in him. Okay. Anyway, you know what I mean. So what do we want to do is we've studied the Apostle Paul, and we're even going to get back to him, but I want to go now to Matthew 19, where Jesus does his teaching on the issue of marriage and divorce. And what we're going to do is break it down into three sections. That's working well because we're doing this for three weeks. The first section is going to be today, and that is Jesus' teaching on marriage, verses 1 through 6. Basically, that's what we're going to deal with. Obviously, divorce is going to be in that as well. But then next week, we're going to deal with Jesus teaching on divorce in 7 through 9, verses 7 through 9. And then the third week is going to be very interesting and I think maybe the most helpful as we talk about Jesus teaching on divorce and remarriage. But then we're also going to not just deal with Matthew 19, but we're going to dovetail it with 1 Corinthians 7 and bring a lot of the stuff that I overloaded you with three weeks ago and really bring it down to where we can grab it and have some notes for it and things like that. Today, verses 1 through 6. I'm not even going to read the text because we're going to go through it verse by verse. Point number one, the setting. Let's just take a look very quickly. And it came about that when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan, and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there. Verse one, he departed. That tells us something is changing. He departed from Galilee. What we know about this particular issue, just for our information, again, to get the background and setting, is that the Galilean ministry that he had is now ending. There's a, excuse me, there's a turning point in Jesus' ministry. In fact, everything from here on in is going to be accelerating toward the cross. There is a new sense of urgency. There is a new sense of even activity. The crowds are going to begin to get bigger. And also, although nobody else really knows it, Jesus knows in his mind that the cross is coming closer and closer. So there's a great sense of urgency as he moves into this area called the region beyond, came into the region of Judea beyond Jordan. There's a specific name for that. I don't know if you care to know it or not, but I'm going to tell you anyway. That area is called Perea, and it means specifically that beyond. It is beyond the Jordan, and that is the Perean ministry that he begins here. It is a territory, Perea is, that is ruled by the ruler Herod Antipas, and that name may not be real familiar to all of you. I don't think he lives next door. A guy named Herod doesn't, but he is the guy who beheaded John. So there's a lot of tension here. He's coming into a place that is not open to the gospel, to what Jesus has to say. It also, again, as I said, marks the final section in Matthew. Lots of crowds, lots of attention, lots of activity, but he's closer and closer to the cross. The 19th chapter is really a turning point in Jesus' ministry. Second verse, he says, and great multitudes were following him, and he healed them there. He also did a lot of teaching. In fact, the parallel passage in Mark 10, 1 says that he taught them as well. So he's going along, the crowds are big, the healing is happening, there are manifestations of his power all along, and all along he's also stopping once in a while and doing some very important teaching, and this is such a time. As all of those things are happening, see, he meets some old friends. Verse 3, and some Pharisees came to him. They are his archenemies. We know all that. These people represent the religious establishment. We know that as well. And they are dogging his steps wherever he goes. There they are. And they are constantly trying to discredit him and put him to public shame so as to destroy his ministry. With that, we get into the meat in verse 3. Now we're at a point two, the confrontation. The confrontation, let's take a look at it. And some Pharisees came to him with this in mind, to test him, testing him. And this was the test. It was a question. The question was this, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause at all? First thing I want you to note here is that they are testing him. This is not a question they are asking because they want information. This is not a question they're asking because they want insight or help with something that they don't know about. It is a question that they are asking that is calculated. It is designed, it is studied to trick him and to make him look bad. Specifically, it is a question that is aimed at doing two things to Jesus' ministry. The first thing it is designed to do is discredit him so as to cause him to lose his following, discredit him with the people. It is also designed to destroy him, not only to lose his following, but possibly to lose his life. They're testing him. How would this question cause him to be discredited with the people and thus lose his following? Well, first of all, one of the things we need to know is that they are aware of what Jesus' teaching on divorce is. They already know that he is going to take a strong stand on marriage, that he is going to take a strong stand on divorce. And at that time, there was, as we've already understood in our study in the book of 1 Corinthians, that divorce was just rampant. and not only was it rampant among the people, but even among the religious people, the Pharisees especially, divorce was just being done for any cause. Two schools of Pharisees were dominant in that particular time. The first school was called the Shammai. The Shammai. The Shammai school was simply named after a Pharisee called Shammai, and that particular school was very strict and very firm on a no-divorce policy. It was not very popular, to say the least. The second school of Pharisaism was that of Hillel, H-E-L-L-E-L. And that was divorce for whatever you want, okay? And that was the popular reigning perception and view of that day. In the Hillel school of Pharisaism, you could divorce your wife for burning your bagels. You could divorce your wife for putting too much salt on your meat. Anything you want, you could divorce your wife. It didn't matter. If she was infertile, you could divorce your wife. If she didn't bear you a son, you could divorce your wife. If, and this was a good one, this was kind of a catch-all, if she was unclean in your sight, you could divorce your wife. Now, that even sounds a little spiritual. Why did you divorce your wife? She was unclean in my sight. Oh, how pious you are. Well, one of the things is, it's very interesting to understand what kinds of things could make your wife unclean in your sight. If you saw someone prettier than her, well, compared to that pretty girl, she looks unclean, so you could divorce her. That's basically how it went. It really got bizarre, and in fact, it's important to know that because when Jesus begins to give his answer, he is not talking to people whose lives have been broken by divorce, whose hearts are broken by relationships that aren't working, and really want to be healed and helped with anything like that. He is talking to people who are unbelievably self-righteous, don't care at all about the law of God, and taken the ordained institution of marriage and absolutely butchered it, and thinking they're really okay in doing it. No big deal. Their hope then was to get Jesus to come out real strong against divorce. If they could get Jesus to come out strong, they could possibly alienate him from the people, get Jesus to sound rigid, get him to sound narrow-minded, get him to sound intolerant, put him in a position where he's saying to all these people who had gotten real lax with their attitudes toward divorce, and basically he'd be calling the whole society adulterating fornicators and things like that. So that's one of their ideas, their testing. And obviously, he's supposed to fill the test. The other thing you want to do is destroy him, physically cause his death. And I think you might even be able to figure out how that could happen if Perea is in the area of Herod Antipas. Herod Antipas was a person who had married his brother's wife. Not only had he married his brother's wife, but this woman was a blood relative of his. So Herod Antipas was in a relationship that was, first of all, adultery. Second of all, it was incest. He was in an adulterous, incestuous relationship with his brother's wife. John the Baptist came along and told him, Dear friend, you are in an incestuous, adulterous situation, and God is going to judge you for that. And for that, Herod chopped his head off. So, if we could ask Jesus this question, get him to publicly declare that the ruler of our territory is a fornicator, is someone who's involved in incest and in adultery, maybe he could lose his life. So with that confrontation, we hear Jesus answer. And by the way, could a man divorce for any cause? That's exactly what they believed. In fact, the Pharisees, as I said already, believed that and were participating in that and divorcing their own wives on a whim. The answer. We saw the confrontation. Here comes the counterpunch. The counterpunch, his answer. And he answered and said to them, this is great, have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female? and said as well, for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh. His answer here is incredible. Now for us, this looks like pure genius. God, this is Jesus and with his omnipotent ability, he knows that they have all sorts of different kinds of attitudes going on here and they want to trip him up and he's able to read their hearts and read their motives and get right to the heart of the thing. But what you need to see is that when they ask him this question, he does not directly answer their question. He goes beyond their question. He's going to go beyond their trap. He is going to go beyond all of their customs that they have adopted for themselves and all their traditions that have violated the law of God. He's going to go right beyond that, and he's going to go all the way back to the beginning, and he's going to start to talk to God. It's as if he says this, okay, I'm going to try to answer your question. Let me try to answer your question by quoting a friend of mine, God. It's great. He's setting them up here. You need to see that. He's setting them up. They have set him up. They think they've got him trapped. Jesus is going to turn the tables on them and do the very same thing to them. He is saying this. This argument that you have is not with me. The argument that you have, the problem you have, by the time we're done, you'll see this, is with God, not with me. Because I'm just going to quote him. Verse 4. If you're following along with your notes, you can kind of pick it up right here. verse 4. Verse 4 is dripping with sarcasm. Read it. And he answered to them, have you not read? You guys, you Pharisees, you Pharisees are the guys who spend all your time studying the Word of God, right? Right? Isn't that right? You are the guys, you Pharisees are the guys who spend all of your time studying the law of God. That's all you ever do. In fact, your job is to study the law of God and study the Word of God and then interpret the Word of God. That's all you ever do. Haven't you read. I know this is weird. You've been doing it for a long time, but this is at the very beginning, guys. This stuff I'm going to tell you is something that happened right at the beginning. Genesis 1.27 is where he starts. This is the first chapter. Maybe you haven't had time to get that far. He begins to quote God here. He begins to quote God from the very first chapter of Genesis, something they had to be terribly aware of. Again, you know what's interesting? They asked him this question to discredit him and make him lose his credibility. By the time he turns this around, uses the word of God on them, the one who's going to lose the credibility are going to be the Pharisees. It's going to be very clear. He gives here four reasons why it is not lawful to divorce. Four reasons why it is not lawful to divorce. Let's look. Verse 4. Have you not read that he who has created them from the beginning made them male and female? He who created them from the beginning has made them male and female. He's quoting here from Genesis 1 verse 27, and I don't think you can get much earlier than that. That's pretty early on, and I think they ought to know about that. Greater than male and female. The thing to note here is this, that in the Greek, this is incredible. One of the things that's interesting about the Greek language, and we have learned a lot of things from the language. When we get into the language, it reveals things that we wouldn't see normally. It comes in what is called the emphatic case. He made them male and female. It comes in the emphatic case. For me to express to you the emphatic case in the English, I'd have to add a whole lot of words. It would go something like this. He made them male and female, and that's it. He made them male and female, and nobody else. That was it. One woman, one man. Emphatic, okay? In the Greek, all it has to do is put it in the emphatic case, and that's the meaning that comes along with the word itself. I don't know if you understand that all the way. Let me just kind of delineate that a little bit more. When it comes in the emphatic case, and it says that he created the male and female, he created Adam and Eve, it means this. It means he created Adam and Eve, and that's it. That is no more. He did not create Adam and Eve and Ethel just in case Eve didn't work out. See, he did not create Adam and Eve and George just in case Adam didn't work out. Now, in the original creation story, there is not all of this meaning in it. But Jesus is taking the creation story and giving it meaning by putting it in that emphatic case. And he's saying this, I want you to know whether you saw it or not, that from the very beginning, God gave us a picture of marriage, and that is this, that it is exclusive. He made woman, he made man, no options, no way out, no other possibility. If they get a divorce If one woman and one man get a divorce If Adam and Eve got a divorce Genesis 1 would have no Genesis 2 It is not only not advisable for Adam and Eve to get a divorce It would be impossible And that's exactly what Christ is trying to communicate here If it's not you two guys If it's not you two, it's nobody If it's not you two, it's nobody There's something about marriage being taught right there It is a non-optional and indissolvable union. And that sent the whole thing in motion. So point one, we would say this. One of the first reasons why divorce is unlawful, and Jesus is giving this teaching to people who are getting divorced for any cause, is this. One woman was created for one man. That's point one on verse 4a. One woman created for one man. That's the first reason. There's another reason. Because of one union. Because of one union. Verse 5. For this cause, a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife. Stop right there. This is a quote that's coming from Genesis 2. Verse 25. He is still dealing with a very primitive revelation of God, and I think that's, again, significant. He's going way back to the beginning. Things that they had to be familiar with. To leave and to cleave. Cleve, his father and mother, and cleave now to his wife. Cleve is a word that is worth looking at real quickly. Cleve means literally this, to have a bond that can't be broken. Okay? Write that down. To have a bond that can't be broken. It is a bond that can be likened to glue. You're stuck. Some of you say, I feel stuck. I've been stuck for 25 years. Okay? Let me tell you something else about that word that gets, I think, closer to the heart of the cleaving that is done between a man and a wife. The cleaving is this. The picture is that of two people who are pursuing hard after each other. It is not just stuck like glue without my will involved. It means also, closer to the heart, is to pursue hard after. Thus, the picture you get of someone who is leaving his father and mother and cleaving to his wife is a picture of two people who are stuck together. Why? Because they're pursuing hard after each other. That's why. Strong bond. That's the second reason why divorce is unlawful according to Jesus. There's a neat picture of this seen in the Jewish word for marriage. The Jewish word for marriage is almost a beautiful word. Even as I say it, it's kiddushin. Kiddushin. It means consecration. It means sanctification. And I could use the word kiddushin if I were a Jew and I were to sanctify an offering to him. Sanctifying simply means what? It means to set apart. Okay? And if I would go into the temple and I would bring my offering to God, it would be kidushin. It would be set apart unto God. It would be my possession that I would take and I would say, God, I'm going to set this apart for you. And when I give it to you, it belongs to you. It doesn't even belong to me. Now, the Jews took that word and applied it to marriage and made it the word for marriage. Kidushin, marriage, simply meant that I do not belong to me anymore. I now belong to you. I am bound to you, and it is kidushin. I am bound to you, and there is no way that we will separate. I belong to you. We saw that very same thing when we were in 1 Corinthians 7. So I don't want to belabor this. This is something we're familiar with. In 1 Corinthians 7, verse 4, it said, The husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife has authority. And the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband. And you remember what that meant. That is not a dominating kind of, you've got to do what I say, authority. That is an authority that I look at my wife and I say, Honey, I belong to you. And I look at her and I say to her, Honey, you belong to me. And she looks at me and says, You're absolutely right, Dave. I belong to you. And then she looks at me and says, but you know what, David, you belong to me. Absolutely. Total giving, total surrender of myself to my wife, and a total surrender of herself to me. That's kiddushin. It is set apart. It belongs to you. I do not belong to myself. I belong to my wife. That's the picture that's being done. Two reasons why divorce is unlawful. Why? Because from the very beginning, God designed one man, one woman. Second of all, strong bond, one union, verse 5. The third is this, one flesh, the principle of one flesh. They will leave and they will cleave, and then the two shall become one flesh. And then in 6a, consequently, profound statement, they are no longer two, but they are one flesh. What does one flesh mean? We've talked about this before, worth going over again. It is not a literal one flesh, obviously. I mean, we don't become one person physically, that's clear. One way to look at it is this, that it's a divine perception. You can write that down. It's a divine perception. When God looks at my wife and myself in the context of our marriage, this doesn't have anything to do with judgment or me being accountable for anything she would do or her being accountable for something I would do. It's not that much unity. But in terms of the context of our marriage, God's perception of us is that we are one flesh. I've said this before as well, that one of the ways that we see that best is in the production of a child. The child that my wife and I bear, bears everything that we are in one thing, okay? The two become one flesh through that, and there's a symbol of that. I think there's some significance that goes even beyond that, in terms of God's perception of what two married people are. If two people become one flesh, and if two really do, by God's divine perception, become one, what you have now is a number that is indivisible. Think on that just for a moment. okay what you have now when two become one is an indivisible number you can't divide it how do you divide one if you divide one what do you get you get you get nothing you get death uh they're they're they're dead i mean you get two halves you don't get two holes two individuals come together become one flesh in marriage becomes an indivisible number that's what's trying to be communicated through the one flesh concept okay and jesus is using it in this context to speak about divorce to people who were what? Who were broken by divorce, who needed healing. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's not who he was talking to. He was talking to people who were doing whatever they felt like doing and had absolutely violated the law of God and the intent of God in the area of marriage. So just keep that in mind as well. Fourth, it is one flesh, it is God created 6B. And this is probably the most compelling reason, I believe. It's the most compelling reason why marriage is unlawful. At the end of verse 6, it says this. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate. Let no man separate. The word separate there is koryzo in the Greek, and it means simply to divorce, to divide, to separate. Interesting verse. This is a verse where some people have come and done some very interesting exegesis on it and come to this and said, aha, here's my out. Now, maybe if you've never heard this, this will come as a surprise to you, but you can look at this and read it a certain way, and it can look pretty neat. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate. And I want to tell you something, Dave, I buy that verse 100%, but you need to know, my wife is so hard to live with, and my wife so defiles everything God cares about, and my husband, the same thing, da-da-da-da, that there's no way that God joined us together. In fact, when we got married, I didn't know what I was doing, and I didn't get married for the right reasons, And I didn't even really care about what God was saying to me at the time. And now we're married and I want to get a divorce because, and I think it's okay, because it says here, what God has joined together, let no man put asunder. And God certainly didn't put us together. If he did, he didn't know what he was doing. You know what that opens up? It opens up the whole question of what is it that makes a marriage, right? What is it that makes a marriage? What is it that makes me married? What is it that God created and when is it that he created it? Some people say that sex makes a marriage. Well, not sex makes a marriage. Some people do say that. But some people say that if you have sexual relationships with someone, that's enough. Let's just stop. That if you have sexual relationships with somebody, that you're married. You're joined. You have become one flesh. So if you go and have relations with some little 16-year-old girl, and you are 16, and it's high school time, and you do it in the backseat of a car, you're married. That's it. In the eyes of God, you've become one flesh. or if you do it with a prostitute, you become one flesh. I don't believe that. If having sex with someone makes me married, then there's no such thing as fornication. Think on that. Because what that would mean is this, that if two people who are not married are having sex, then what they're doing is not fornication. What they're doing is getting married. Right? I mean, some guy, not in the will of God, not caring about what God thinks, not understanding anything of God's grace to him or anything like that, goes and makes a terrible mistake and finds himself with a prostitute, he's committing fornication. He's not getting married. Sex does not make you married. In fact, I want to take you to Exodus chapter 22. I want you to turn to it. I want you to see this. Exodus 22, 16. Exodus 22, 16. And if a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged and lies with her, he must pay a dowry for her to be his wife. okay oh that seems like it affirms that you're married okay and if her father absolutely refuses to give her to him he shall pay money equal to the dowry for virgins that what that verse indicates is that sex does not make the marriage what it means that if you do have sex one of the things you need to consider real heavily is that you do get married but it's very very possible that the father will say no i don't want you to get married you're not ready to get married you have no love in this thing at all god is not honoring this at all you don't get married sex does not automatically mean you're bound. That is not what does it. Sex is a demonstration, once you're married, of the union that is there. Understand that. Further, let me just do a little more teaching on this. Not only does sex not mean you're married, adultery doesn't dissolve a marriage. Adultery, sex doesn't make a marriage, and adultery doesn't dissolve a marriage. Malachi 2.14. Let's look at that quickly. It's the last book in the Old Testament, Malachi 2.14. It's where the pages are real white and unwrinkled. Okay, let's start in verse 13 so we kind of know what's going on. And this is another thing you do. He's really rebuking these people. You cover the altar of the Lord with tears. Oh, you come to worship services and you get all excited with weeping, with groaning. Oh, man, you call on God because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand. Yet, you say, for what reason? Why, God, aren't you hearing this anymore? I'll tell you why. Because the Lord has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth against whom you have dealt treacherously. Dealing there treacherously is adultery. That is specifically what was going on there. Adultery. You have been committing adultery against the wife of your youth, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant. What you have here is an example of someone who committed adultery, but what God is saying here is that you are married to that woman, and she is still your companion, and she is still your wife. What is it that made the marriage here? What is it that made the marriage here? Sex. So if sex, no, that's not true. If sex did make the marriage, that when that guy committed adultery, he would no longer be married here, he would be married there, right? That isn't what happened, though. What happened is this. Sex does not make the marriage, that does not make the bond. It is an expression of the bond. That is, by the way, why adultery within the context of marriage is so painful, because it is a breaking of that bond. It is a violation of that bond. But what makes the marriage here is the covenant. You see that? You committed adultery, and you broke the covenant. You broke, not the covenant, you broke the bond between you, and you violated that, and you caused tremendous pain, but you are still married, Because what makes you married is not sex. What makes you married is covenant. What makes you married is the promise that you made. It's the covenant. And any time that covenant is made between two people, that promise to be together, to promise myself, we call them vows, we call them promises, we call them a wedding. When that covenant is made between a man and a woman, whether they are Christians or not, remember that, God makes a marriage when that covenant is made. He binds that marriage. He creates that marriage. It is an act of God. It is a miracle of God. I would liken it to the birth of a child. Compare it to a child being born real quickly. All would agree that a child being born is an act of God. It's a creation. It's a miracle of God. Whether that child is born to a believing person, a regenerated person, or a pagan in Africa, that child being born isa miracle of God. It is a creation of God. Right? So is a marriage. When that promise is made between two people, a covenant is made and a miracle takes place, and that is this, that God makes a marriage. Think on this. Pretty heavy-duty stuff. If I say it this way, continue the analogy. I'm sure it breaks down someplace, but I'm going to say it nonetheless just for effect, if nothing more. Abortion is, to childbirth, what divorce is to marriage. Abortion kills what God created. Think on that. So does divorce. Kills what God created. That's pretty extreme stuff. I think Jesus is trying to be extreme here. Who's he talking to? People who've been broken by divorce, who want to be healed, who want to be put back together. No. He's talking to people who are doing whatever they feel like doing and running whatever way they feel like doing and he has given them the heaviest law he possibly can. If you separate this, you are dividing and you are ripping apart and you are destroying what God has created. You just better know that. Is there forgiveness for people like that? Obviously there is. Just like there's forgiveness for someone who ever committed an abortion or anything like that. There is forgiveness and there is healing, but he's not talking to people who want it right now. Interesting thing, as I said before, instead of losing credibility, Jesus is gaining it. He quoted from God. So, they say to Jesus, is it lawful for somebody to get a divorce for any cause? Their purpose is what? To discredit him and to destroy him. Jesus says, don't you know what it says from the very beginning? Four things. One man, four reasons why divorce is not lawful. One man, one woman. There aren't any options. Two, strong bond means leave and cleave Three, one flesh principle It's the indivisible number And four, because God created it If you tear it up, you're tearing up what I created So with that, we have the teaching In mind And with that, we have people maybe here Who say, okay, I'm just going to keep my marriage together We will stay married Why? Because God said you can't get divorced Okay And the problem is that while for some people and I think some people in this room, marriage is heaven on earth. Anybody here would concur with that? Marriage is heaven on earth. There is also some people, that's a little extreme, okay? There are also some people in this room who would say, no, I don't think marriage is heaven on earth. In fact, if you want to really know, I think marriage is hell on earth. There are innumerable people who are splitting up or on the very verge of splitting up and those people are not just in the world, they are in the church and there is much pain when it comes to this particular issue. It's a common problem. next week as we get into this even further and begin to talk about some of the other things that they ask him we're going to understand some of what happens when the pain begins to come and how do we help put people back together again well i think it'd be helpful right now to get a little bit back off of this text just a little bit in fact what i want you to do i've got a few other things for you and i want you to go on the back of this thing if you want to keep taking notes I think it would be helpful to us To gain some understanding When we see divorce running rampant And we see maybe some of the same attitudes I really don't think we see the attitude on divorce That the Pharisees had Where it's flippant in the church But we do see pain In our society we see a lot of flippancy I mean There's advertisements on the radio And on TV and in magazines Where it's easier to get a divorce now Than it is to get married It costs you 25 bucks It's no big deal you just go and it's over, no problem. So in our society, people can't divorce for any cause. How did this all start? Let's go back to Genesis 1. I think this will be exciting. Genesis chapter 1, verse 27. Point number one, I'll give you three quick points here. This won't take long. And by the way, if you were with us about four years ago when we did the book of Ephesians, some of this will be something you've heard before because we covered some of this. The first thing is God's ideal, God's design for the relationships between a man and a woman. This is exciting. Verse 27. And God created man in his own image, and in the image of God he created him. Male and female he created them. And God blessed them. And God said to them, he didn't say to Adam, Hey Adam, I got something for you, tell Eve later. Because you're the big boss in the home, I'll tell you now and you tell her later. He said to them, be fruitful and multiply. Who? Both of you. And fill the earth. Who? Both of you. And subdue it. Who? Both of you. And rule over the fish of the sea. Who? Both of you. And over the birds of the sky. Both of you. And over every living thing that moves on the earth. God said to them. In the beginning, this is pre-fall. In the beginning, there was between the man and the woman what we can call a co-regency. A co-ruling together. A harmony between men and women. No conflict. No tension. It was mutual. It was caring. The man was fully man. Everything that makes a man is who he was. There was strength in him. There was protection in him. There was perversion. Later came the perversion. There was provision provided by him as a man in that home. Woman was fully woman. There was strength in her. There was provision in her. There was protection in her for him. And it went both ways. It was mutual. There was a majesty about their relationship. There was no discord. They multiplied the earth together. They filled the earth together. They subdued the earth together. Okay? That's pre-fall. It's incredible. There's a mutuality to this. There's an equality, to use a word that we hear all the time today. Second thing is this. Point 2, Genesis 3. Let's move up a chapter. Genesis 3, excuse me, verse 16. We see point 2, paradise lost. The design is distorted. What has happened is Eve has disobeyed, Adam has disobeyed, and the curse is being delineated to them, and it comes specifically to Eve in verse 16, where God says this to her, To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. In pain you shall bring forth children. And here's where it gets to the relationship between the husband and the wife. Yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you. I can't tell you how many times I've heard that verse used as a proof text to show that the husband needs to be the ruler in the home. That's how God designed it from the beginning. What we need to understand is that this verse is what happened. This is a curse, is what we have here. Something is missing in our understanding of this verse. Let's understand it. Your desire is for your husband. What does that mean? Well, maybe it means that from now on, the woman is going to be desiring her husband physically. Okay? It could mean that. It doesn't mean that. And maybe it means that from now on, the woman is going to be desiring her husband and come to him emotionally. It could mean that. Maybe it means that she will desire him psychologically. That would be wonderful, but that's not a curse. I mean, if the woman is all of a sudden now desiring her husband and loving him, and oh, now it isn't, that's not it, because what we're dealing with here is the curse upon him. The word there, desire, is what we need to understand. It comes from an Arabic root, and it means this. It means to seek control. It means to seek control. It means to usurp. It means to vie for power. Okay? It comes from an Arabic root. It means to seek control. It means to usurp. And it means to vie for power. In fact, I think the best way I can give you the word is to look over in chapter 4, verse 7. You see the same word used in a different context. God is speaking to Cain after he sinned, and he says this, If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? And if you do not well, if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door, and its desire is for you. Do you get the picture? Its desire is for you. You know what that means? Sin's desire is to get you. Sin's desire is to usurp you. Sin's desire is to find your weak place and go right for it. That's exactly the same word that is used here for the curse. And from now on, women, instead of this co-regency that you have with your husband, and this co-loving and ruling and living in the world together, now your relationship has changed. You seek to control, you seek to usurp, and you vie for power. Now it says, and he shall rule. Interesting word here. Translated in the Greek Septuagint, which is simply the Hebrew Bible translated into the Greek, the word there is kathistemi, and it means literally this, to install in an office. The husband will be installed in an office. Now what it means by that, you know, like it would be if the president got installed as the president. Okay? Or the vice president gets installed in office. Man is installed as a king. Like that, man? See, God even said that. Man is installed as a ruler. But you need to remember something as you use this particular word, kethiste me, it is in context of a curse. So this ruling that he does that is part of the curse is not a good ruling. It is not a healthy kind of ruling. It is a curse that is being brought upon that relationship because of the fall. It's a despotic kind of rule. It's a dictatorship. It's not a healthy thing. The definition of chauvinism, I'm sure, might just flow right out of this word. It is a dominating thing. Again, I don't want to use this verse for the model of what God's design for the church in terms of marriages are. This is a curse of the fall. The co-reigning concept is shot. What you have now, as we put this together, is a fall from healthy relationships, a fall from co-regency, of co-reigning and ruling together. Now you have a vying for power. Now you have a woman who is seeking supremacy, and you have a man who is seeking for suppression, and that's basically the rule of what's going on inside of these people, and then they get married. Isn't that wonderful? What's ruling and what's moving on in the heart of a woman since the fall, before Christ, before redemption, is this seeking supremacy. What's ruling in the heart of the man is this desire to dominate and suppress. And then these two people who've got that ruling in their hearts get married. And now we've got a 58% divorce rate and we wonder why. Point three, paradise regained. Point three, paradise regained. Ephesians 5. Ephesians 5.22. What I'm saying is that as a result of the fall, along with childbearing pain and all these other things, one of the things that's going to be ruling in the heart now, not necessarily even ruling, but one of the battles now for humanity, for the woman, is going to be this thing roaring up in her rather than being able to deal with his headship or anything like that. There will be this constant wanting to jab at his position and bring him down, and this constant desire from the man that is not God-ordained. When I think of ordained, I think of God-blessed. This is not a God-blessed relationship. This is a curse. This is a curse. This is what happened. And fundamentally, it is the rule of our society. It is the relationship that people who are unredeemed have. When we come to Ephesians 5, I'm calling it Paradise Regained. Because Ephesians 5, and I want to give you a little bit of an insight before I even dive into the text there, is one of the demonstrations of what happens not only when someone becomes a believer, but when a believer is being controlled by the Holy Spirit of God. Contextually, what we have in verse 18 is this. Don't be drunk with wine for that's dissipation, but be filled, remember that, controlled, dominated by the Holy Spirit of God. And when you are controlled by the Holy Spirit of God, some wonderful things start happening. All of a sudden, relationships that pre-fall were harmonious and loving and giving and caring, and there was a co-regency, begins to be reversed. It says, and be subject one to another in the fear of Christ, comes the wives. Specifically, wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord. Paradise regained. Be subject to your husbands as unto the Lord. Be subject. Does that seem hard? I would think it would sound like it seems hard. I mean, once in a while, maybe we could buy that. But what it says here is as to the Lord. Subject to your husbands as to the Lord. Now, see, I'm married to this guy named Harry, and I know Harry, and I even love Harry, and I even respect Harry, and I even know that Harry loves the Lord and is redeemed. But there's a lot of things that are true about the Lord that aren't true about Harry. And I'll tell you what. Be subject to your husband. Oh, my goodness. How does that happen? How does that work? And then it moves down, men, to this where it says, Husbands, love your wives just as Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for the church. Husbands, love your wives. How? As Christ loved the church. And so you've got this giving. And all of a sudden, we've got a contrast. I brought you full circle here. See, when I got you into the curse thing, we've got men who are doing what? Dominating and asserting their authority and asserting their power. And their idea is to crush the woman. And now, bringing it back pre-fall is fundamentally what you've got here. You've got a relationship here where co-regency and mutuality, and I'm not, please don't understand, please understand me, I'm not destroying headship in the home of the man. But what I am talking about is a co-regency returning, not the crushing. Now he's saying you love your husband, you love your wife. Put it together. After the fall, when sin entered into relationships, what did you have? Wives sought to do what? They sought to control, they sought to usurp. Husbands sought to what? They sought to dominate, they sought to rule, they sought to crush. Chauvinism. Now, because of regeneration, because of the cross, and now because of the spirits dwelling in me, and now, as a believer, the potential that he has to control me, the wife seeks to what? To give, to support, even to submit, to subject herself. This husband seeks not to dominate, but he seeks what? He just wants a lover. He just wants to give to her. He just wants to build her. He wants to protect her purity. He wants to nourish her. You know, that doesn't sound like there's any losers in this to me. The point is this, that as we come to Ephesians 5, there is a return to the Genesis chapter 1 and Genesis chapter 2 designed for relationships that God intended from the very beginning that was destroyed by sin, but is made possible again by the regeneration of Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit in a Christian marriage. and again i just refer to this you know you think about that kind of co love that co ruling together in a home and that mutual submission literally mutual submission verse 21 be subject to one another in the fear of christ is that possible it has to be possible christ doesn't call us to do things that are that we can't do and it comes when we talk about verse 18 do not get drunk with wine for that is dissipation but be play rao be filled be dominated by the Holy Spirit of God. Be controlled by the Holy Spirit of God. And that results in chapter verse 21. Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ. If you are filled with the Spirit of God, if you are controlled with the Spirit of God, if he is the one who has been given the lordship of your life, one of the results is an ability to subject yourself to each other. Husbands to wives, wives to husbands, and on and on and on. Conclusion, Matthew 19. Let's get back to it real quickly. Read a verse and we close. Verse 7, they ask him another question. It's as if they didn't skip a beat. They're still bent on tricking him and discrediting him and destroying him. And so they ask him this. So they said to him, Why then, if everything you said is true about divorce, why then did Moses command to give her a certificate of divorce? Give her a certificate and divorce her. Moses did do that. Moses did command no he didn't we're going to find out that he didn't command or even twisting that but he did talk about a certificate and divorce that's an awfully good question and next week we'll answer it let's stand and we can be dismissed in prayer this concludes the message on this cassette if you would like further information on this subject or a copy of our free catalog contact Growing in Grace area code 612-522-366 or write to Growing in Grace, 6421 45th Avenue North, Crystal, Minnesota 55428.
