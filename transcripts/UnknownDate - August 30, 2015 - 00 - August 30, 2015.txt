The scripture reading this morning has been drawn from Matthew 28 as well as Acts 1 verse 8. And Jesus spoke to them saying, All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. I want you to go therefore and make disciples of all nations, beginning in Jerusalem, but then in all Judea and Samaria too. and even to the remotest parts of the earth. And don't forget, I'll be with you as you do this, day after day after day, right up to the end of the age. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. that was Anne Marie FinSas and you're going to get to know her better she's working very closely with Vicky and myself actually in the planning of the center of formation that's coming this fall and we're very excited about that So, good to meet you today. They were his final words, actually, those words that Anne-Marie just read in Matthew 28 and also in Acts 1, just prior to his ascension, after his resurrection, I want you to go. Indeed, just as the Father has sent me, he said to his disciples in John 20, 21, I am now sending you beyond the friendly confines, or what we've been calling the friendly confines of what's familiar or even safe. So beyond Jerusalem and Judea, he said in Acts chapter 1, both of which in reality and in metaphor were both familiar and safe, into places like Samaria is where I'm sending you. Samaria, which is neither familiar or safe physically, spiritually, Samaria isn't safe. and while it took a while you know the story for them that is the early Christians kind of starting out in Acts chapter one it took a while for them to go at least to get to Samaria beyond what was familiar and safe they finally did in Acts chapter eight so here they are finally in Acts chapter eight living in Samaria and last week I suggested that maybe we are to living in Samaria in ways that we don't always see and can't always tell, in part because we never moved to Samaria like the early church moved from Jerusalem, and they kind of physically could tell they were getting to this unfamiliar and unsafe place. We didn't make a move like that. Samaria kind of came to us. We didn't have to go anywhere. It was already here. And when it happens that way, when it kind of comes to us and kind of just comes around us or you're born in it in some ways in Samaria, you kind of get used to the temperature of the things that you're swimming in when you're swimming in the things of Samaria. So after a while, when you get used to the water, you're not just in Samaria. Samaria is in you. and we don't know when it happened and we're not sure how but everyone seems to agree that this Samaria that we live in, at least it's what I'm calling it, is this post-Christian culture that we live in. Some are beginning to call it a pre-Christian culture which really makes it feel like Samaria to me simply confirms that we are maybe living in Samaria when you actually start to see that, that wow, this is the culture we're living in, and begins to sink in that reality, it can be a little frightening, actually, because just like the Samaria of Acts chapter 8 that we talked about last week, we live with what I called last week this confusion of voices, which was very consistent with what was going on in Samaria. Everybody was saying all sorts of different things. There were religious voices, and political voices, and ethical, moral voices, and lifestyle voices, and all of these voices were very loud and very confusing, and all of them push us and pull us and invite us to follow, and sometimes we do, and when we do follow these voices, confusion of voices, we wonder, how do we, how did I get here? Because we're not just in Samaria. Samaria is in us, and we're not sure when it happened, although it seemed to happen fast. The voice of the church in the context of this Samaria that we live in has somehow become irrelevant. It seemed to happen fast. I thought we had a voice. It seemed to happen fast. The voice of the church suddenly became not only irrelevant, but very easy to ignore because the verdict is in. And all the research confirms that the generation next, We've been talking these last few weeks about the millennials. That's Generation Next. Have very little interest in any kind of church. I don't care what you put on, what kind of show it is. Indeed, they're leaving church in droves is what all of the research reveals. And it's not that they're necessarily hostile toward the church. They just have no interest. They see absolutely no point, which is at least part of why for the last couple of weeks, In my return from sabbatical and my sharing with you those things in me that have grown most prominent has been this. What's grown is this, that if we're serious as a church about preparing ourselves as a people for next, we're going to need a significant paradigm shift around how we do church and how we view church from what I've been calling, and you're familiar with this now, I think, what I've been calling the church as destination model because we have it, you need it, come and get it, it's here. We're kind of saying to the culture or the attractional model where we spend all of the resources we have financially, but also, I mean, just think about it. All the creative resources we have in the attractional model of church are spent trying to attract more and more people to come here because we have it, you need it, come and get it, it's here, they're not coming. Maybe other people from other churches who like how you do it better might come, But this Samaria thing, no interest at all, which means the paradigm shift. It has to be, is this our incarnational model where we spend all of our resources financially, creatively, trying to think up ways to equip and empower more and more people who will be full of the breath of God, becoming fully alive in God, being transformed by the spirit of God into the character of Christ in order to go. Come here, come here for equipping, and then go because we're living in Samaria, and Samaria is not coming here. We need to go there. They were his final words. I want you to go beyond the familiar and the safe. But Samaria isn't safe, you guys. And part of what it means to be preparing ourselves as a people for next, in my mind, means talking about the danger of where we live, this culture we live in, pre-Christian, Samaria, whatever you want to call it, because we get used to the temperature of what we're swimming in. I do, you do, we all do. And before you know it, we're not just in Samaria. Samaria is in us in ways, whoa, we didn't know, we didn't see, all of a sudden you kind of wake up to it and go, whoa, how did I start thinking like that? So what I want to do today is talk about that. Quit pretending about that and acknowledge that. But I want some help. We're going to do some things a little different today. I'm going to ask Peter Kapsner to come up here and join me because I don't want to do this by myself. And I want somebody smarter than me helping. So I asked Peter to help. There's a couple reasons that I've asked him to do this and why we're doing this. One, there's a lot of different ways to teach, and I'm fascinated by them. And even one of the things in my sabbatical that I spent some time thinking about was how I can carry the Word of God in a different way. I don't have time to unpack what I mean by that. But this is experimental a little bit because you have no idea what you're going to talk about. I haven't even told you what the topic is. I have no notes, yeah, I know. Actually, we have talked about this. But there are three reasons I asked Peter. One is his voice is familiar to you. When I was on sabbatical, a number of people spoke, but he was the primary voice, and he invited us to stand at the crossroads and look. And we're going to kind of stand at the crossroads today and look and see what the ancient paths are. The other reason is because you have your own story around this, aware of the way you live in Samaria, but ways Samaria has gotten inside of you and how you can walk out of that. And the third is Peter's place and the perspective he has as a teacher, professor at Bethel University and also Northwestern University, which puts him in, I'm always in these conversations where I'm just fascinated by what you say because you're with the next generation, you're with these millennials. And so the question is, Peter, when you're with this next generation who is kind of the hope of the future because these schools are kind of bringing the best that evangelical churches have to offer, kind of. They're going to these kinds of schools. What do you see when we stand, when you stand at the crossroads and look, what do you see about what's happening in Samaria? A couple weeks ago, I called it a pre-Christian culture. Whoa, that's fast. What's going on? Yeah, I mean, as you and I have chatted, and talked about a number of things, specifically about the Sumerian us. And I both hate that phrase and love that phrase because it's real. And it is the temperature, it is what we're swimming in. And one of the ways in which we're swimming in it that I run into all the time is just in, obviously, the issues of sexuality and how we perceive one another in these ways. And specifically in the class that I teach on sexuality, happened again this week, started class, and two things became very apparent, but they've been happening over these six, seven years I've been engaged in this subject. And that is number one, Samaria is not a static place. It's always changing, it's dynamic. We sort of get our head around one thing, and it shifts and it moves, and I don't know. And an example of that is I remember when I first started teaching on sexuality six, seven years ago, and kind of making it up as I went along because we don't talk about these things in the church and didn't know, but the main thing the students wanted to address in this class was how to deal with pornography. And that was a significant issue. And that's, again, six, seven years ago, but was not being talked about just because it didn't seem relevant to them at that time was homosexuality. And in just the very small time frame, the little window, the span of this, now my class, pornography's sort of come and gone. Not because it's gone, but because that's sort of the accepted, yeah, that's just part of how we're going to swim in this realm of sexuality. It's all of us. And what we really want to talk about, Peter, homosexuality. And so I spent a number of years diving into that. And even now this year, it's like, yeah, we need to talk about that. But what about transgenderism? And what about the global sex trade? And what about photos that I take on my phone that disappear, but I can send them just before they do and nobody knows and I just get overwhelmed in that setting because some areas always moving. And as you've said, two things this week, again, class of 30 students, but it could be any 30 that come in, started class, and just said, you know, you guys, I'm just going to go ahead and assume that 30 out of 30 of us, in fact, 31, myself included, out of 31 of us have been touched or in pain or significant turmoil or something related to this issue of the summary of sexuality. It is in us. I'm just going to assume that. And again, all the eyes drop in the room. They know. and I've just sort of read the mail of all of us in that time and the question becomes what do we do? And one last thing, one piece about it, I was also in a class on Tuesday night which is it's a degree completion program where pastors of our churches in our area, churches you would know, and they're coming to complete their degrees and as soon as we start talking about sexuality again, the response is yeah, that's in me and I have no idea what to do about it. And so we open up the box but now it's terrifying. because they didn't know how to talk about it. No, no. Okay. The other thing that was interesting when we talked earlier was that you kind of said it, but the pornography issue and sexuality, premarital sex, all those kinds of things, not so much to talk about it because we couldn't gotten used to the water. Right. It's, yep, that's just sort of unassumed things. I mean, I listen to my students even, they talk about the assumption is that they really should test for compatibility before they get married. These are Christian students' tests for compatibility in those areas. before you get married, make sure that's dialed in as if that never changes throughout the course of your life. Some people know. Yeah, right, yeah, I know. Yeah, great, just saying, yeah, that's how it's always going to be, so now you got it. We just touched on something. This is why we got to make sure we get in our time here, but I fear sometimes around the sexuality thing, and you need to test the waters, all that baloney, is that our generation, you know, we just go, you shouldn't do it. And we've never given, and we need to give. There are really good reasons why things like this need to happen in covenant. And there's people who have paid a very high price for ignoring that. And you can get through it and heal and fine. But we give stupid reasons. And they don't work. No, we tell everybody, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Now put on a ring, walk down, do, and it's fine. And it's, yeah, it's wildly confusing. One of my favorite moments, and you move along, but just to give the vows talk, why does it matter to speak over another person that no matter what I find in you, as we unfold with one another, I will cherish, I will not forsake. Why does that matter for creating space in our sexuality? That sounds so old-fashioned, and yet it, and you can just feel the life beginning to come. Yep, yep, yep. Yep. And that's hard work to do that, like explain, here's why. Takes me hours. I'm taking some more than a sermon, too, by the way. it can be discouraging actually overwhelming last week's talk I don't know if all of you were here but I talked about living in Samaria and my wife and I talked afterwards and I felt this uneasiness and Bonnie said something to the effect Dave you really put us in touch with how despairing it is thank you but the truth is the Barna Group came out with something new again the divorce rates among evangelicals is the highest in the country. So in Samaria, the evangelicals have the highest, wow, that's weird, which means we're not just in Samaria. Samaria is in us. In fact, a Baylor University study came out with the same kind of thing, but said in the Bible belt, divorce is 50% above the national average, 50% above, wow. So how's that knowing the Bible thing working for you? Anyway, Ron Sider in his book entitled Scandal of the Evangelical Conscience some years ago. Actually, it was an article in Christianity Today, and he basically just sounded an alarm, okay? And part of this is doing that, citing four areas of life among evangelicals, divorce, sexual behavior, generosity, our giving, and issues of racism, where the evangelical church that, you know, Jesus said, you need to go and have an impact and the culture is just really not much different than Samaria, which is discouraging anecdotally. I remember where I was at some sort of conference, and I think it was a pastor's conference, and somebody said something to the effect, and it became this official thing that people said, and I don't know how true it is, but I've heard it several times, and it was that at a lot of these conference centers, like a big hotel where there's going to be a conference, when a religious group comes in, or like a group of pastors comes in, the purchases of X-rated movies in the room, it goes up, and that's weird. That's like, wow, we're not just in Samaria. Samaria's in... And we start thinking like Samaria, and we don't even know it's where we got it, from this culture. I'll never forget Judy Haugen saying, just kind of in passing, and I had to unpack it. She says, you know, I've never met an evangelical who doesn't love a good war. You didn't just read quite in here. What? What? What? What? And I remember thinking if you were against that kind of thing, and there might be reasons to be against it, there might be times it's appropriate, it was like ungodly. You've got to be the country, and we're living in Samaria, and it's in us. So here's the deal, because we're not going to leave you in despair here. I don't think there's reason to be despaired. There's reason to be alarmed. This is the deal. What I'm talking about today, this is part of the story. Doing this kind of work is part of the story when you talk about standing at the crossroads, going from Genesis to Revelation. You're going to find this story in that story because over and over again, God was calling out a people to be a blessing. And he said, when you're in Canaan, don't marry Canaanite wives. And it just looks, you read the Bible, and it goes, that's so weird. They were pretty. It was about being in Canaan. You're in Canaan, but now Canaan's in you, and you're going to think a different way, and you won't be able to give the life that I want you to have all through Paul's epistles. He says things like this. You need to be aware. You need to be awake. And sometimes we fall asleep. It's one thing. This is what we talked about this week. You know, when Israel was delivered from Egypt. I mean, what an incredible, the exodus, you know, and God used Moses, the Messiah-type person, to bring the people out of Egypt, and that's a symbol of redemption. They got saved. They're not slaves. It was a whole different deal to get Egypt out of Israel because they wanted to go back to Egypt and let me go back to Egypt. I'm just saying, when we talk about stuff like this, it's part of our story. This is the way it is. It's in me. Samaria is in me. It's in us. And so this isn't kind of like picking on us or you. we're all in this thing together and this is the work and this is why man when we talk about using all our resources financial and creative to figure out ways to equip people and empower people to come alive to God we talk about coming up with reliable means for people to authentically come alive to grow to change it's why Al Shuck talks about discover, connect, and serve and how we need to connect with each other in order to discover who God is and who we are and why we're here and to do it for the sake of others. It's why we're forming a center and spending all of this energy, resources, financially and creatively to come up with a formation center where we will teach people practices, spiritual practices that give them the kind of space in their life they need to hear God and then know what he's calling them to do. And when you're done with that course, two-year thing, you'll be fully formed. And no, you won't because it's part of the deal. Samaria's innocent ways we don't even know. There's a layered thing. It's why the Apostle Paul in Colossians 129 says, for this purpose I labor and strive till Christ be formed in you and in me. Awake, aware, alert, Ephesians 5. All things become visible when exposed by the light, so awaken, sleeper, and rise from the dead. Because sometimes you just need to say, hey, wake up. We all, whoo, wake up, wake up. So how do we navigate this? One thing was this, we both agreed on this, a big deal, you can't do it alone. And I know you've heard that. I got an email or a text from a buddy of mine this week that speaks to this. and I'll just read a part of it. He says this, I think the hope comes and that is the hope of getting Samaria that's in us, out of us. I think the hope comes from the possibility of finding a way out of Samaria. I feel like I've been wandering around there by myself for too long. I'm far too aware of Samaria in me. I'm not sure how I even got there. I don't feel like I entered it as a brave, noble person who was trying to change Samaria because God said go and bring this influence, but more like someone who was walking on a path and got lost. Wow, relate to that. I don't think we're supposed to wander in Samaria alone. The hope for me right now is for getting out of Samaria and resting somewhere that feels safe. Well, resting somewhere that feels safe and out here things like rhythms of life and retreat and remember who you are and you got to get some space to do it. This guy's in it. but isn't pretty what do you hear in there yeah I I remember back probably 25-ish almost years ago a little bit longer shorter I don't remember time escapes me but we were in the sweaty gymnasium in Robbinsdale and one thing that you read from that and about this idea of can't do it alone is when you were going through a series on pain of porneia or pain of the brokenness or the fracturing of our sexuality and all the ways in which we see your invitation at the end of that message was one thing you can do is you can break the silence on that. And you can talk about it with somebody. And I remember hating you in those moments back then. But feeling so utterly compelled. And Hallie and I were engaged at that point. And I've told some of that story before about just back in those early seasons of my life, 18, 19, 20, 21. I mean, I know it's shocking that somebody would be engaged in pornography, right? I know it never happens, but yeah, it was, yeah. That was weird. Go ahead. Keep going. I'm sorry. Yeah, can we go back to Tove? I don't know that I want to talk about this anymore. Yeah. Whew! So we broke up in the box, and we started the journey on that and what that might look like, and maybe you can even say more around that, but that was, that's the first thing that emerges from that text or email that you received about, yeah, you can't do it alone. You got to break it open. And that did set something in motion, but it wasn't free right away. It wasn't, bang, done. Okay, good. Good to go. I mean, you've got stuff around that, but that started the process. I can say more. Yep, yep. You will in a minute. Well, I might just walk over here, actually. What's the deal with this? You should need something to play with. Just a prop, yeah. It makes me feel comfortable. that's good I like that yeah yeah right yeah I might not eat me coffee we talk about this a lot around here and it's you know the breaking the silence thing I remember that was big in the early days it's still big but to deal with the Sumeria that's in us all requires among other things courage there's this courage you have to have like I hear it in this guy's text like I gotta have hope and I have to bring it out into the light and tell other people but it is the courage to live in the light and I just go all the way back to Genesis I think about this a lot it's part of the story you stand at the crossroads you look back you see the ancient paths and in the garden when sin came in the first thing that happened was shame came with sin and when I feel shame I what? I hide I'm preaching why am I preaching? I do this in conversations I feel like I'm feeling convicted now. Good, good, good. Shut up. The shame makes us hide, and so from the beginning, this is in us all. It's in us all, so the courage to come out in the light and go, no, no, no, this is what's really going on. I love 1 John 1, 5. I think about it a lot. God is light. And in him there is no darkness at all. And, you know, growing up it was like, he's just, it's all the right answers. He's got the right answers. in Christmas time when I was talking about Jesus is the light and what it means to me. Light is, it's like he's the ultimate reality. He is bright. And then the next verse, it's like he's true. And the next verse says, if you say you have fellowship with this God who is about the ultimate reality because he's light and light exposes things, but you walk in darkness. And again, I grew up thinking that meant, but you have sin. No, walking in darkness, we all have sin. In fact, 1 John goes on to say that. Walking in darkness is pretending you don't have sin. So if you say a fellowship with God who is light, but you're all about pretending and hiding and not telling the truth and not bringing it out, you lie about having fellowship with God because he's light, and you can't, the light would expose. That's the courage. And by the way, when God shines his light on our stuff, it's not to embarrass us, it's to heal us. And you've got to believe that. And there's got to be grace for that to ever happen. But the courage to live in the light where what's true about my lying and my whatever it is I'm doing. There's this, a year ago I was going through some really hard things in our family. We were going through some hard things in our family. It was hard to put our fingers on what's really going on here. And over and over in the lectionary that we would read, because you don't get to pick the scriptures because they're just there. And over and over were these scriptures that I'm familiar with, but it was weird how often it was coming up. And it was these places where Jesus says, you just need to know everything whispered in silence is going to be shouted from the rooftops. Everything hidden in the dark is going to be revealed in the light. And I've always read those verses as, ultimate judgment is going to be all your secrets are going to be told in front of everyone. No, those verses to me are more about the movement of God all the time that those things that are whispered. Oh, God, he's inviting you. Say it out loud. Say it out loud. Because I don't want to embarrass you. I'm going to heal you and release you from this junk. Everything hidden will be revealed. And so do it now. do it now and all of a sudden that requires a different kind of faith than believing the right thing about Jesus I've got to actually believe that Jesus would heal me and help me if I brought it out into the light another thing we talked about is and this is back to you that when you bring it out into the light what I want to feel is I'm better now I'm sorry, I said I was sorry so we brought it out into the light and now it's there and maybe it's ugly and we're done. Beware the quick fix. That's the, if you really are interested in having Samaria kind of get out of you a little bit more and more and more, this is layered. It could take some time. There's grace along the way, but you have some stuff on that. I mean, those moments when broke up in the box and Hallie and I began to journey and stuff together. Yeah, it felt good to say things out loud. There was just some freedom that came with that, but then I didn't know what to do with that. It was like, oh, I'm done. Not really. And then it just became about trying to just control any sort of behavior, make sure that that behavior doesn't happen again. We can't ever have that behavior again, and we didn't have the internet back then, but it would have been along the lines of make sure the blockers are up, make sure you're an accountability group where you check in once a week and make sure you tell everybody how you slipped up and didn't or all of those sorts of things. Well, you're fine. Yeah, I mean, I say all the time to my students, I mean, if you're struggling with robbing a bank, for example, I mean, you probably need some prison bars around you a bit just to stop that behavior. You know, you don't want to check in with the accountability. Oh, I slipped up one more time this week. I robbed another one. You know, it's it. And so, yeah, I mean, do that. Stop the damaging behavior. And what I can say is that I became really good at that. I became really good at that. And then the message of the church was, you know, you are going to be drawn in, Peter. It's just how people see. You're going to see the billboards. You're going to see what's on TV. And then the internet's going to grow. You're going to see those things. You are going to be drawn in. That's just who you are and how you're wired. But make sure as you're drawn in that you don't engage further. You stop any behavior, those sorts of things. And in fact, and I've said these things before, but you learn to bounce your eyes. You learn to just, you know, look, no, yeah, no, and you, you know, and you become sort of this champion eye bouncer. And I did that and was proud of that. And you could have roped off my room with velvet ropes and had a tour of the champion eye bouncer that was there. Because you wouldn't look. Oh, you know, but I'd be drawn in, but then I would turn away. And that's what the books would say. And that's what the sermons would say. And that's what everybody said. So I did all of that. And that's still in bondage. Because of what, the question was, is Peter, how do you see? How do you see? And I'll never forget, I was in class, and we were going through some of these things, and I didn't have good ways to talk about it with my students around how you see and all these sorts of things. But all of a sudden, a light bulb sort of turned on, and I asked all my students, and I said, just pretend you're in a relationship, married or significant other, whatever that might look like. And I asked the question, would it be painful for you if your other, if your spouse, if your boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever that looks like, would be drawn in to somebody else even for a second? And then they turn away and, hi, honey. And hi, honey. Hi, honey. And they do. I don't like it when you do that. No, I don't like it either, actually, at all. Yeah, that's really. I'm sorry. And Hallie's not here, so I'll do it next to her. Go, go, go, go, go. I remember everything. Yeah, right. But I was doing all that, and Hallie and I, yet there was not healing. There was not freedom in that. And I would ask the question, would that be painful? And all the hands in the room would say, yes, that is painful. But I bounced my eyes. I didn't engage. I didn't click on that link. I didn't open up that book. I didn't linger there. And I began to ask the question of God, is there more? Because are you, God, the champion eye bouncer in the sky? Is that the greatest gift you've given us? Is there a different way to see? And churches hadn't been talking about that. Because that would take transformation. Yeah, you might have to actually change how you see. It might take some time. Oh, yeah, a magic wand, no. And people ask, so how did that happen for you, Peter, as if now I've got the five steps that God put in mind in Ephesians 12 about how to do it all, right? And it started with just simply that prayer, God, help me see. God, what do you see when you see? Because you saw in Genesis 1 that it was good. You saw that it was Tov. You saw that it was meant to unfold in a certain kind of way. You saw what it was that was the good and the wonder and the delight and all of those sorts of things. Can I see? I didn't have the language back then, but can I see in that way? And every day, help me see as I walked around Bethel. Help me see as I walked around Northway, as I drove down the freeway, as I walked in the mall, as I sat with my family, how it would help me see. And yeah, you know, a couple years go by, and all of a sudden you get whispers, and I think maybe that's how you see, and I want that sort of thing. And I just, what I became convinced of in all of that as I began to see in ways that I think are consistent with God's way of life, I just became more and more broken. and more and more, I don't even know the language, but I told you this week, I said, I will never forget just standing in the laundry room of our house, and finally several years into this, and I still can't see, and I'm still in it, and it's all what's in this text about, I can't, the Samaria's in me, and I can't get rid of it. I remember just finally collapsing on the floor of our laundry room and just saying, God, I can't do this stuff. I want, you know I want it. Help me see, and it was in those moments that something was brought to life, And I can't explain it great in language, but I remember thinking something's been set loose. And God almost saying in his moments, you know, Peter, I do care about your behavior, but what I really want is your heart. What I really want is your heart. And it took that long and all the layers to be peeled back before that was the case. And then I will say something was set loose in our lives and how it was in my life. And what I would say is it was freedom. And I don't have to, and I've said this before, I don't have to have internet blockers on the computer because the way that I see has changed. And I don't need to be accountability groups because the way I see has changed. And it doesn't mean those things aren't important. They are. But when the life and the light of God comes, it actually changes how you see. And I know we'll talk more about heading into Samaria with that kind of life. But that was a five-year process for me. There was lots of nights on the couch, lots of nights of pain, lots of arguing, lots of everything. We stayed in that struggle of being fully alive even many times when we didn't want to. I'm hearing you say something. I'm putting it together in a way I haven't before, at least with you talking. But it's almost like what I heard you say was that the boundaries and the blockers or whatever those things are, that's the advice we get. And it reminds me of the bruising, bleeding Pharisees. I don't know if you remember about them. The bruising, bleeding Pharisees in Jesus' day were people who dealt with their lust by not looking. So they would put hoods over their heads so they couldn't see. And they were bruised and bleeding because they kept walking into walls and falling down stairs. I know, right? You're the only one who actually left. I think it's wildly funny. But the picture I got of your journey, and you gave us just a snippet there, was that some of those boundaries that said, no, I'm not going to be an accountability. It gave you space. It gave me space. To deal with it. But also, I lost my train of thought. It gave you space. Oh, no. It made you hungry for more. It did. Because this has got to be more than this. I'm white knuckling it. That's good. It's better than not. Better than robbing the bank again that week. Right, right. But wouldn't it be great if I didn't care about robbing the bank anymore? Wouldn't that be good? Is that even possible? Right. So what I get excited about, and I start smelling, and I'm thinking about church and us and becoming a people who have this incarnational presence because of the life of God's in us. It's like you got more than forgiveness. Okay. You did this bad thing. Okay. I forgive you. It's great. Yeah. You got more than forgiveness. So I want more than forgiveness. You got transformation. That feels hopeful. I have a number of heroes in my life you're one in this story anybody who's gone this journey and stayed in it long enough to experience Joel Hansen Joel is one of these heroes who said several years ago shine the light give me more and he came to life in a variety of ways over and over again but another hero of mine is a guy named Steve goes to our church She grew up in this church. I've known him pretty much his whole life. And his story is one of sexual abuse, a horrible story in this kind of Christian environment. And one of the ways he dealt with it was to avoid it and deny it. He was okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. And the way I believe this is so bizarre, but one of the ways he managed to avoid and deny his pain about the abuse and even not even acknowledge the abuse was a bunch of religious junk. I kept it good. Yeah, he just used a bunch of religious stuff and, you know, God this and God that, victory stuff. And even he got in, he was a very charismatic kind of individual, very kind of personable, and people loved the guy. And so he got involved in ministry, and he was like this rising star. So that was another thing that led him. Isn't it weird? I mean, this is good stuff. ministry is good stuff and religious good stuff but he used all that to never feel his his pain and his his stuff and um it wasn't until he kind of crashed because the other thing he started medicating with wasn't just all this religious stuff it was some very inappropriate and painful to him sexual stuff as well and and then all that gets exposed and i love hearing him talk about that because he said it was the worst day of my life. It was the best day of my life. He describes it as that was when I got saved. And he began to walk out of this thing and you hear him walking out of the thing and it's just the same story as yours, only different little things here and there, but that there just wasn't a magic wand in this. There was grace and hope along the way and life and then more life and then more life and then you don't even know what you're going toward when you're going toward this freer, fuller place. And you said this week, too, just, I mean, unless a seed dies, it will not come to life. That whole idea of death begets, I mean, you start walking in this stuff, it will kill. I mean, in a 35-minute deal here, it can sound like, well, that's great and it's hopeful, but you want to walk, it'll just about kill you. It will kill you, and it'll hurt. Yeah, it is that cycle. I mean, you just mentioned the cook. Jesus said, unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, worst day of your life, comes life. And we're about fully alive people. And now guys like Steve and you and others in that place. See, this is so weird because we want to engage a culture because we're so much better than them and we're going to fix them. It isn't what works. It's almost like a guy like Steve that I just described is a guy who can actually engage and go beyond the familiar and safe. Not from a lofty perch wagging his finger at Samaria, but from a place that is aware of his own brokenness. And from that place, you go to people who are broken, and if you've gone through your stuff, you've actually got something to give. This could change the world. all of which means again this whole thing the worst day when the light gets shone and you get busted is the best day Richard Rohr speaks of this kind of thing as the sacred wound and I love it because he takes this passage I've heard all my whole life and it's speaking of Jesus the stone that was rejected became the chief cornerstone and that's speaking of Jesus but in terms of sacred wound Think of this verse this way. The stone that got rejected. The stone that got rejected was that piece of your life, alcoholism, sexual addiction. It's, ah, I want to get rid of that. Oddly, you talk to anybody who's gone through their stuff, like the alcohol synonymous and those kinds of people, and now there's kind of a freedom. The alcohol addiction they had that they would reject actually has become the cornerstone of their freedom. and their new life. And that's, they're not ashamed to talk about, it's there, there it is. And now when I have other places of darkness, I just, okay, I can walk through this one too because there's something I've built my whole life on. And it's kind of around living in the light. Yeah, I become convinced, and I didn't always start class this way, but now assuming that all of us who are following Jesus have professed our faith, we will follow and not turn back that that doesn't mean, again, as you've said so well, that Samaria is not in us. And so when these students come into the room, and I didn't always start this way, but I would say, as I said, I'm gonna assume Samaria is in us in some ways, but know this, if there's not a power at work that is possible in this world that ultimately can set us free, if the cross doesn't matter ultimately, if the resurrection, if life in the spirit and the breath of God is not possible to heal and to reconcile and to restore, having grace to create space to come into the light of truth. If none of that stuff is true, let's just walk away right now. There's no point. Why would we claim to be followers unless these dry bones, as we sang, these dead places can't come to life in ways in which we can see? Then we're playing a game. We may as well just walk away. I'll give you an A for the class, and let's get out of here because there's no point. But if we want to engage, there is hope. There is hope. And when you talk like that, it makes me wonder if the millennials who have no interest, is what they have no interest in, is what you just described. I mean, not, it's the, you know, pray for air, you go to heaven when you die, who cares? You see, some of you go, what do you mean, who cares? What if you could actually be free? What if you could actually change your life? That's good news. In heaven when you die, that's good too. We're talking coming to life right here, right now. And it's funny when you come to life, and I think we know this sort of thing, as you come to life and you carry that cornerstone you described so well of what God has done in your life, I think you end up in increasing ways becoming a person who holds the tension of grace and truth all at the same time because as a fractured vessel, as somebody who's walked in the grace of God, I desire the truth not because I want the truth. It is because that's what will set you free. And so you walk in grace, and the fracturing and the vessels, knowing that it's sufficient as we walk out into Samaria, but calling people to truth, again, not because we're angry and upset, but because that's the only thing that will set you free. But we'll create space for that light to shine so that you can come out into the light, what's in the darkness, and walk in this stuff. People who've gone through this process and really dealt with their stuff and the grace of God has come and something comes to life, there's one thing that's consistent with all of them, they're gentle. Yeah. It's not the anger thing. In fact, the people who are angry and trying to fix everybody probably haven't looked at their own. They haven't done this. Because if you've done this, it's really sometimes humiliating and embarrassing and hard, and then you come to life, and then you want to give it a life just like you said, but you do it in a different way. Let me close with this. We're calling it an incarnational model, where we're not spending all our resources, financial or creative, trying to think of ways to attract more and more people to come here. We're trying to spend all of our resources, financial and creative, to figure out more and more ways to equip and empower more and more people to live authentically in the light, aware, awake, alive, people becoming fully alive, Being transformed by the Spirit of God into the likeness of Christ in order to authentically go beyond the familiar and even the safe. But to all that, let me add the end of the verse that Anne-Marie read after he says, Go beyond the familiar and the safe into these places we're describing that might scare you a little bit, but you'll come to life. Matthew 28 says, and oh, by the way, I will always be with you, even to the end of the age. I will be with you in this. Psalm 139, where can I go from your spirit? If I send, success, you're there, and that's good. if I descend to dark places, even there your hand will lead me. Even your hand will lead me and invite me out of the dark place into some light. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer. Peter, would you close in prayer? Sure, I'd love to. You're good. Yeah, thank you. Thanks. God, in the space of people who have said yes to following and want this life, I ask that you would continue to do your work among us and lead us and guide us as we break open these boxes about what it means to walk in the light in these ways. you would bring healing and restoration into these places in us. So yes, good for us, but for the world around us, that we would be able to finally give a sense of hope, that there is more than all the sound bites and all the voices, that there's more there that awaits, that a life would come. Thank you for the space and for the we-ness and the all-yall-ness of this place, that we could walk in this way. By the power of your spirit we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thanks for coming. See you later. Thank you.
