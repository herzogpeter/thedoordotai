It is easy to talk about this theologically. It is easy to break this down and let you see it and give you four principles and let it happen. And we'll all leave understanding but never know. And we need to interact with this. We need to join together in bringing not just our minds but our hearts to this vital, vital text. I don't know how many times I have come into this pulpit as we've gone through the book of Ephesians and we have studied a section here and there and it has deeply affected me and I come into the pulpit and I say this. This is it. This is the pinnacle. This is the most important section that we are going to cover in the entire book of Ephesians. I did that when we came to chapter 3, verse 16. This is it. Be strengthened with power by His Spirit in the inner man. That whole concept of Christ settling down and being at home. Ah, this is the point. This is it. If we forget everything else, we've got to remember this. I did the same thing. When we came to chapter 4, verse 1, walking the worthy walk. Making my walk equal my talk. Making my walk equal my position. My practice equal my position. I did the same thing when we came to chapter 4, verse 15. When we spoke of speaking the truth in love. And that's the method by which we grow up into Him, even Christ. Speaking the truth in love. Most important thing. 422, strip off the old, put on the new, do it all your life. That's the characteristic of the believer. taking off the old life, putting on the new life. This is it. Chapter 5, verse 1, same thing. Be imitators of God. Most important thing. And now we're here in chapter 5, verse 18. This is it, really. All those other ones, just kidding. The filling of the Spirit of God in the life of the believer. The resource, the enabling, the power to do the things that God has called us to do. And if there's anything I want us to catch, it's this, that all of those things that we have been talking about in chapter 4 to this present time, the worthy walk, walking in humility and patience, would be nothing but a list of legalistic do's, things that I should do if it weren't for this particular text. Eliminate this, and all we've got is a legalistic code to try like crazy to measure up to. in the middle of our study of the book of Ephesians when we came to that text in chapter 3 verse 16 and we were speaking of the inner man being strengthened by his spirit with power I likened the entire book of Ephesians to like a car a high performance race car I think you remember that in chapters 1 through 3 we were being instructed as to the equipment that this incredible machine had the resources that it had this high performance engine and these neat tires and this neat style and all this kind of stuff and that's who we were as believers and the wonderful resources we had as believers. Chapters 4 through 6 was the map. This is where I'm supposed to take this car. The ignition, remember, where I turn it on by an act of my will is when I come to the Holy Spirit and say, I want you to settle down and be at home. I want you to be strengthening the inner man. Well, to go along with that illustration, this is the gas. This is the gas. This is the fuel. And we spoke just last week about foolishness and not to walk as those who are fools, but to walk as wise. And maybe the greatest fool of all is the person who tries to walk the worthy walk in the flesh without the gas, if you will, of the filling of the Holy Spirit of God. We can't do it. I want to tell you something, and again, I'm just trying to grip your hearts here as we begin to move into this text a little bit deeper this morning, that if I don't understand what it means to be filled with the Spirit, to be controlled by the Spirit, I am opening myself up for some very crippling problems in my Christian life. Two that I'll give you very quickly. The first problem that I'm going to open myself up for if I don't understand the concept and the dynamic of the filling of the Spirit in my life is maddening frustration. Absolutely maddening frustration. Trying to produce the worthy walk by trying hard can be one of the most frustrating experiences you'll ever experience. And one of the things we spoke of last week, that when I'm approaching the godly walk of the believer by trying to do it myself, that what I really end up doing is performing. I end up pretending that everything is right when I know it isn't right, And I just begin to just, instead of letting the Spirit work through me, it's all being done in the flesh and I'm performing. I fearfully discipline myself to convince you that I'm kind of spiritual. I've arrived and I'm there. When I get myself into that kind of lifestyle of trying to perform all these things by myself, there's only two ways to go with it. One of the ways to go with it is to just keep it up. Just spend my whole life performing and doing it and trying to convince you that I've arrived and that I'm humble and loving and joyful and denying all the things I'm really feeling and the things I'm really struggling with and my own sin. When sin comes up, if I'm supposed to be performing, there's no way in the world I can admit it and that means I can't confess it and I can't open up and I can't get healed from it. So if I'm into this performing these things in the flesh, The one thing I can do is just keep it up and go and go and go. And it requires more and more and more denial. And it requires more and more and more lying. And deeper and deeper I go. The other thing I can do when I get into this kind of lifestyle is just give up. And I have seen many people do this. And I think I've shared my testimony enough with you that you realize that I came to a point in my life where I almost gave up because trying to be the Christian, trying to perform for everyone, being a pastor's son and knowing the role and knowing the things to do and knowing the things not to do and doing them very well, got to a point where I said, I don't see the life, I don't see the joy, I don't see the peace. And this advertises it, but I don't see it anywhere. So I'm leaving. Kiss the whole thing off. This is a crock. You know something? The only way to break into this maddening frustration of trying to produce it in the flesh is to do just exactly what happened to me. The problem is, I trust that when you give up and quit trying, and quit trying to perform and pretend that what you do is don't leave the Word of God and don't leave the Lord and don't leave the church, but to realize that that's exactly the place you need to be, to give up trying on your own, to realize that the truth that will set you free from this bondage is simply this, the Spirit-controlled life. Galatians chapter 3. This is not a new problem. This is not something that happened in the 20th century. This is not something that kind of happened with your parents or my parents or something that just kind of was born out of some sort of philosophy lately. Galatians chapter 3, verses 1 through 3. Paul says this, You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you? Before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified? This is the only thing I want to find out from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish, having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by your own pretending, your own striving? No way, it'll never happen. And you're opening yourself up for nothing but maddening frustration. The other thing you open yourself up for is a malignant pride. Pretending results in me acting like I've really got it. and some people actually believe that they have arrived but that wouldn't even work either because those who act like they're arrived really are into performing and so what they do is they act like they're humble so what they say is even though they feel very spiritual and very pious and very superior what they do is they look down and say I haven't arrived I'm on my way because we play the humility game too we play all these games and it's all performing and it's not the spirit I'm the one who's really doing all those things a pride. I think we've all been in churches like that. And we felt the pressure of performing. And I think we've all felt the pressure that kind of results in my heart and in your heart when we're in that kind of atmosphere. It's kind of a fear. I wonder if I'm doing it well enough. I wonder if people think I'm spiritual. I wonder if I'm saying it right. I wonder if I look right today. I wonder if I'm happy enough for them. And we come and that's why we put on the face when we come to church every Sunday morning. and we want to create the right impression and so i pretend and it's all i do over and over and over again and a result of that kind of thinking and a result of that kind of living is just a group of proud self-righteous people who in reality are just bound with fear wracked with pain and after a while we don't even know how to be real anymore we don't even we hear about being real and we even think we are we've lost it completely the very thought of revealing myself in front of you the very thought of revealing myself in front of the body the very thought of revealing myself to god is something that is absolutely terrifying so what i do is i keep on pretending and i keep on performing feeding the delusion that that's really spiritual and i call it the abundant life and the good news we talked about last week was this you don't have to pretend anymore and if the holy spirit is going to be leading us into anything he's going to be leading us into an openness and an honesty with where we're really at so that then he can move in and heal and put us back together you don't have to pretend anymore in fact i would have to take it a little bit further than that. With what we discussed last week about what it means to be filled with the Spirit, the filling of the Spirit would necessitate that not only I don't have to be pretending anymore, but I can't pretend anymore. I cannot do it. If the Spirit of God is illumining me and shining the light of His truth in my life, I can't pretend anymore. He won't allow me to do it anymore. We left last week with the realization that whatever else the filling of the Spirit is, the filling of the Spirit is not a vehicle whereby I deny my pain, I deny my fear, I deny my weakness, I somehow escape and put on a happy face, but that it is the divine energy of God living in me, giving me the resource to face my life, to face my pain, to look at it, deal with it, take the mask off it, take the cover off of it, let it all come out. I can't pretend anymore. I can't perform anymore. The performances in this church and in my life and in your life have got to stop. It isn't an option. It's one of the things we're going to get to next week. The filling of the Spirit is not an option for the believer. Pretending for the believer, pretending in pretense, is not allowed. Na, na, na, na, na. And you know what? As I begin to think of what it means for me that I can't pretend anymore and I can't perform anymore and I've got to be honest with you and I've got to be honest with me and open myself up, I begin to realize that maybe that's what it means to be broken. Maybe that's what it means to be broken. Can you picture the Pharisee we spoke of last week? You remember him? There was the publican and he was broken and he was crying out to God. And there was the Pharisee standing over there and going, Oh, I thank God that I'm not like him. Can you imagine the Pharisee taking off that mask of hypocrisy? What it must take for him to quit pretending? What it means is for him to quit pretending, he would have to be broken, wouldn't he? He'd have to break down and say, I am the sinner. Maybe that's what it means to empty myself. Maybe that's what Paul meant when he said, when I am weak, then I am strong. Because when I am weak, and I quit pretending, then I'm strong. Then I am filled. And then I am strong. I hope you got that when I am weak and quit pretending that I'm strong then I am filled and then I am strong I debated over whether I wanted to share this or not but I have to I need to not too long ago this very thing was witnessed by me with a very close friend of mine someone I love dearly and this is risky to share this because it is not an illustration of someone I knew or someone who is kind of distant but it's someone who I love and is here and it happened the scene and the setting are not important for this what happened was I'll never forget the look on the face of this dear friend of mine the wringing of the hands the tears that were coming and tears don't even work it was more sobbing and what I would even though these weren't the words that were being used what I would say was going on in his mind was basically this as we were discussing what this kind of thing meant as we were discussing honesty and openness and letting the spirit begin to move and touch those places that I have hidden all my life it was as if with his head down just writhing in pain and it was a painful thing the sequence could have gone something like this the promise came you don't have to pretend anymore and that brings hope but we all know that but so what? isn't that nice? it kind of makes you feel good that doesn't mean you dealt with it I don't have to pretend anymore then the next step in that is this I can't pretend anymore but I still haven't dealt with it the next step is this I won't pretend anymore it was as if you could see in this person's body those cycles go from I don't have to till I can't till I won't and out of his mouth and out of his eyes came 28 years of pain and anger and fear and guilt I won't pretend anymore. And you know what he did? What he did is he emptied himself. He broke himself. I'm not going to pretend anymore. He humbled himself. And he was filled. And then the story goes on like this. And everything is wonderful from now on. Everything is wonderful. I'm filled with the Spirit. I broke myself. I understand what that means. and now everything's wonderful. Not at all. What that means is basically this. Now that person is learning to continually empty himself so that God can continually fill him. I can't pretend anymore. The question I would have is this. Does it always have to be painful? Is this breaking of myself before the Lord always a painful thing? No, I don't think it always is. But maybe it depends on how many things I'm hiding and how long I've done it. How many things I have just crammed down inside of my life so that no one can see them and no one can hear them and God can't even see them and God can't even know them. He knows them and He hears them, but He can't deal with them as long as I'm cramming them down. There can never be the release. There can never be the freedom. And maybe I do need to change my mind because maybe that breaking experience is a painful one because I'm taking off the mask, but it's when I do that the filling of the Spirit comes. Okay, that's our introduction. I'm just even finishing up from last week. I told you last week we had an introduction. We've got to get into the text, and we've got to study this. All I have told you from last week till that point is where we're going to go. It's not even like this is the study and this is it. I've just told you where we're going to go. These are the things we're going to be discussing. Three weeks of introduction. It's kind of like an airplane ride. What we've basically done the last two weeks is kind of look over the things we're going to be looking at, and now what we need to do is get out of that airplane. That's been fun and exciting and it's really thrilling and isn't that neat? But we've got to get down on the ground and look at where we're going. And I hope that when we do that, we're going to understand a lot more of the things I've been saying, but from a bird's eye view. This text basically can break down into three sections. The first is this, the contrast, and be not drunk with wine, for that is dissipation. And that is contrasted to the command, but be filled with the Holy Spirit. You have a contrast, be not drunk with wine, and that's contrasted to the command, that's the second part, be filled with the Holy Spirit. And then the third thing is the consequences. The consequences of the filling of the Spirit is speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. And those consequences are going to follow us right up to the spiritual battle in chapter 6, verse 10. It's going to affect my home life, it's going to affect all the relationships that I have, this filling of the Spirit. We're going to get to that. Let's get to it right now. First, this week, the contrast. It's going to be a little more academic than last week, but we've got to study. And do not be drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, or that is excess. Which is excess? Paul's using a very effective tool right here. It's a tool that good preachers use all the time. It's simply this, an illustration. Webster defines an illustration as the act of making clear or bright something that is not clear and bright. It's a pictorial representation using words, okay? Now, the reason an illustration works, if I use an illustration, the only way it's going to work is if there's a connection in your mind. And you kind of can paint that verbal picture, and you can understand it. It helps you understand a different thing. The point is not the illustration. The illustration is something I use to describe something deeper and more important, right? You understand that. The airplane, that thing of the airplane flying over it, I understand it because I know what airplanes do when I've been in an airplane, and I see the broad view, and I also understand what it means to walk on that same trail or ride on that same road that I saw. It's a totally different perspective. It connects because I understand that. Wine, his use of wine here is an illustration that Paul is using, and it connects very well with these Ephesian readers. The real focus of what he's trying to talk about right here is two-dimensional. There are two things that he wants us to understand, and he's using wine to illustrate that. Let me give you the two things. Write them down if you're taking notes, and I hope that you'll understand them as we go along. What Paul is dealing with here now, in terms of the contrast, is first of all an external control. Be not externally controlled. Be not controlled by a counterfeit. And the second dimension, the second thing he's demonstrating, is excess. Those two concepts, external control and excess, are the two things. Wine is simply a beautiful illustration of both those things But the focus isn't wine The focus is what? The external control, the counterfeit control, and excess The idea is this That the resource for my joy The resource for my comfort Cannot be external for the believer It cannot be something outside myself And it's contrasted to an internal control And that is the Holy Spirit You got that? It's kind of foggy I think as we go along You'll understand it better Wine is a great illustration of an external control Wine is a great illustration of a counterfeit control Something that gives me a temporary kind of joy A temporary kind of comfort Something that works, it looks like it works It's an external control, it's something outside myself But what I want you to note is this That he could have used anything to illustrate that point He happened to use wine because it connected well with them I think maybe if Paul wrote to us and he wanted to warn us about external controls being the source of our joy and excess being something that isn't for the believer, he might have not used wine. He might have used something entirely different. He might have come to the church at the open door and says, be not drunk, dear friends. Be not externally controlled, dear friends, by your career. Is there something wrong with the career? No. You know what's wrong with the career? If you're using it to fill your life, if you're using it as the source of your joy, something wrong with it? no you know what's wrong with it? excess if it is the sole source of your joy and if it is the sole source of your peace and your comfort something is very drastically wrong be not externally controlled by money by position by church activity maybe he would have used that one with us you know there's nothing wrong with that again there's nothing wrong with church activity but you know one of the things we get into very easily is using my church activity as a way to kind of blind myself to what the Spirit of God really wants to do. See, because I'm serving on the board, I'm teaching a class, I'm preaching the sermons, I must be right where I ought to be. Not necessarily. I missed the point. And if I'm wrapped up in that external control, that being the thing that affirms me, I'm going to be deluded real easily. I'm not sure Paul is making a statement about wine as much as he's making a statement about external things controlling my life being the source of my joy and excess being the principle that we are to avoid and wine just being a beautiful illustration of both of those things. Wine is a beautiful illustration of an external control that does things to me and I don't have to be responsible. I don't have to think. I don't have to evaluate. It just makes me feel better right now. It's a great illustration. It connected especially with these Ephesian people. And that's another thing we need to understand. When he said wine to them, they had a totally different perspective on this than we do. We have a real aversion to this kind of thing, and properly so, I believe. The aversion we would have is that we would... Oh, I don't want to go into a big history on this, because that would just get off the point. The problem is this, that the people in Ephesus, their staple drink was wine. And so they didn't make the connections that we made. They drank wine like they drank water. The problem is this. that the wine they drank wasn't near the potency that we have. And that's a fact. I know that it always sounds like we're trying to get out of something when we say that. The fact is this, that the wine that they drank in place of water because the water was bad was something that was tremendously diluted. And you had to drink gallons of it to get drunk. Obviously, there were kinds of wine that could do that to you. The point is this, that when they heard Paul say, be not drunk with wine, the illustration worked. It connected with them because wine was something that was part of their everyday life. It was something that was watered down and as they drank it, and it's an everyday event, they realized that there were good things and bad things in it. One, excess. If I looked at it as being the source of my joy, and I could because I could just drink it and drink it and drink it and drink it, and get blasted, and the excess would be in there too. It could become that external control. The problem is this, that it wasn't necessarily that that was evil. The excess is what was evil, and the using it as the source of my joy was the thing that was wrong. And we use all sorts of other things, don't we? Their religion was into an escapism. Their religion was into denying the things it felt, and the way they did that was by getting drunk. And Paul's fear when he was speaking to these people was simply this, that they would bring that same mentality of escapism and magic wands being waved over their problems into their Christianity. And he had every right to believe that they might do that because Corinth did it. The record is very clear. They had an incredible, Corinth had an incredible ability to take whatever corruption they were involved in in the world and drag it right into the church. If they were cliquish in their former life, they were cliquish in the church. If they were hero worshipers in their former life, they were hero worshipers in the church. Remember that? I'm of Paul. I'm of Cephas. I'm of Paul. It's all on and on and on and on. Brought it right into the church. If they sued people in their former life, they did it in the church. If they were proud and egotistical in their former life, they brought it into the church. If they handled their pain by escaping and denying in their former life, they brought it right into their Christianity. If they got in touch by being out of touch, they brought it right into their Christianity. and that's how they live their life. And they even look at the Holy Spirit the same way. The Holy Spirit, like I said last week, is that little pill I take and now I've got the glory granted. Everything's gone. Everything's wonderful. Paul's saying, look, don't drag that junk into this. Christianity is not about escape and magic wands and denying where I'm at. Christianity is about the filling and controlling, not the lack of control, but the controlling of the Spirit who gives me the resource now to face it, take the mask off of it, so he can heal it. Again, the good news is you don't have to pretend anymore. You don't have to pretend anymore. You shall know the truth and it shall make you free. Be not drunk. Be not controlled with something that is outside yourself, but be filled with the Holy Spirit. How do you get filled? What does that mean? I'm going to have to come back next week I trust that as we consider these things our minds and our hearts will continue to struggle with the concepts we're dealing with now next week what it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit I'm leaving you hanging and I know it it's good for you let's pray Father I pray that we would spend some time considering those things that we are using and don't even know it as the source of our joy. Not necessarily bad things. The problem is excess. The problem is I throw myself into those things and I begin to really believe that those are going to be the things that fill my life. Paul has warned us against that. May we hear the warning and hear it clearly. Not only hear it, but now act upon it. I ask these things in your name. Amen. Amen.
