Galatians chapter 5 verse 16. We're continuing study in this book. Galatians chapter 5 starting in verse 16. In fact, let's start in verse 13 to get the context of this. You really get a better flow when you do that. Starting in verse 13, For you were called to freedom, brethren. But here's the clarification. Don't turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh. But through love serve one another, for the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement you shall love your neighbor as yourself. But if you bite and devour one another, take care, lest you be consumed by one another. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. For these things are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law. Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you before that those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God, but the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law. Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. Let's pray together. Jesus again we would come and ask you to be our teacher I feel Father that this walk of the Spirit this walking by the Spirit is the crucial element in our living in unleashing power in unleashing glory in unleashing consistency in unleashing love, joy, peace we work so hard to understand and explain with words but father we are overwhelmed again with the fact that your spirit does indeed need to open eyes and soften hearts give us eyes to see and ears to hear as you speak to us this morning in jesus name amen Paul not only spoke of freedom for the believer, but he was militant about it when he did. A legalistic Christian to the apostle Paul made about as much sense as a carnal Christian. They just didn't go together. Freedom was the thing that Paul talked about that the believer had in Christ. But he had a problem, and it hounded him all his life, and that was this. When Paul spoke of freedom, he got misunderstood. It was something that just happened. Whenever you speak of freedom, what people would begin to hear is, I guess that means we can do whatever we want. And especially for the Jew. For the Jew, the law was to him, and for many of us, the external law was for him the only restrainer that there was for sin. And so when Paul came along and spoke of freedom in Jesus, what that Jew would hear very often was that you are taking away the restrainer and sin is just going to run amok. What they didn't understand was that the restrainer is no longer external. It is now internal because the Spirit comes and takes His residence in our lives and brings power and glory and holiness that is real. But Paul, understanding that there was misunderstanding, worked very hard to make his doctrine clear. That's why verse 13 through 15 he says, Listen, you were called to freedom. I will not back off of that ever. But understand this about freedom. Freedom is not license to do whatever you want. It never has been. It never will be. What we are talking about is not abolishing the moral law of God. We are talking now of fulfilling the moral law of God, not by the external pressure of a law, but an internal transformation by the Spirit. Big difference. But even after that clarification, the question still stands, if I am not under law and if you are calling me to freedom in Jesus, What really does restrain me? What controls me? What is going to unleash Christ-likeness in me? You see, when you talk about freedom, no matter how hard you explain it or how hard you try to explain it, when I hear freedom, something loosens up in me. And I do get this impression that I can just kind of float along, make my own rules, kind of just do whatever I feel like doing. Paul says, listen, you are not under law. You are no longer a slave. You are free in Christ, but freedom is not license. Here is your restrainer. I say this. I say this. Don't give yourself a whole lot of external rules. I say this. Walk by the Spirit, and you won't fulfill. You won't carry out the desire of the flesh. That is the secret. Last week, we broke this down into four sections. I want to give them to you again very quickly. We have four parts in this text. First of all, the command. That is verse 16. Then we went into the conflict, verse 17 and 18. Verse 19 through 23 is the contrast and finally the conquest. We are just going to tip the iceberg of the conflict this morning. First of all, the command, verse 16, walk by the Spirit. You want something to do? That's what you do. This is the only imperative, remember, in this entire text. He does not come to verse 23 and say, Be loving, be joyful, be forgiving, be patient. No, those are fruits. Those are results of one who has done the imperative, and that is walk by the Spirit. That is the command. We are commanded to walk by the Spirit. What does that mean? Discovered last week, some of the things it does not mean. It does not mean walk next to the Spirit. Like I put my hand in the hand of the man who stole the waters, and I walk with Christ. I walk with God. It doesn't mean I walk with God. It doesn't mean I walk next to the Spirit. It doesn't even mean I walk in the Spirit. Some of the translations have that. You walk in the Spirit. In the Greek, it is the instrumental case, and it means to walk by the means of the Spirit, according to the Spirit, on the basis of the Spirit. And you know, you hear that and you think, Dave, what are you making such a big deal of that? It's just a word game you're playing. You just want to make sure we say it right. And I'm not going to say walk in the Spirit. I'll say walk by the Spirit. I want to tell you something. It's more important than just a word game. The reason it is important to understand that my walking by the Spirit is indeed not walking in the Spirit or walking with the Spirit, because the essence of Christianity, beloved, is not God with me. It is not God next to me. The essence of Christianity is not me living in some spirit sphere or some cloud that is the Spirit and kind of comes around me and envelops me. The essence of Christianity, the definition of Christianity, The distinctive, that which sets it apart, is the indwelling Christ. That is not a new concept to most of you, but many of us have not let the power of that dawn on us. 2 Corinthians 6.16 says, You are the temple of God. Means God lives in you, just as God said. That verse goes on to say, I will dwell in them, and I will walk in them. The essence, the definition of Christianity is not me walking next to God and staying as close to Him as I can. The essence of Christianity is that when by faith I receive the gift of His grace, of His free gift, what happened was the Spirit of God came and indwelt me, took His presence in me. That is what the prophets looked and hoped for. Ezekiel 36, verse 27. I will put my spirit in you. And Ezekiel the prophet heard that promise and said, Thank you, Lord. Bring your Messiah. Because that's what we're lacking now. We try as hard as we can to keep your law under the old covenant. But we can't. The promise was, I will send my spirit one day. Then you'll be able to. That was what the prophets looked for. That was what Jesus promised. Acts chapter 1, verse 8. You shall receive power. When will you receive power? When the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you shall be my witnesses. The essence of Christianity, the definition, the distinction is indwelling Christ to empower me. That is also what the first believers experienced. I think this is an exciting text. The Holy Spirit came for the first time at Pentecost. You're aware of that. Some strange things began to happen. And people did indeed begin to do all the things that they were trying so hard to do before. Powerful living. Experiencing the presence of God. And what people were seeing in these people in whom the Spirit came was something they'd never seen before. It needed an explanation. Peter gave it to them in chapter 2, verse 14 of the book of Acts. Peter, taking a stand with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them, Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words. These men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only the third hour of the day. But this is what happened. This is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel. Remember the prophets? What did they look for? What was the thing that they were being promised? It was the indwelling spirit. It was the thing spoken of through the prophet Joel, and it shall be, it says, in those days God says that I will pour forth my spirit upon all mankind. And your sons and daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams, even upon my bond slaves, both men and women. I will in those days pour forth my Spirit. If you are a believer, what marks you as a believer is not that you just believe that Jesus rose from the dead. That is a belief that energizes the power of God in you, but that is not what sets you apart. What sets you apart is that by placing your faith in Christ's atoning work, the Spirit of God has taken His residence in you. If that has not happened, you are none of His. that's the essence that's why it's important to say walk by the spirit walk according to what you already have two possible reasons we indicated that you might not experience that one is that you don't have the spirit you don't have the spirit you're a naturally born son of abraham and everything you do in terms of a religious thing is simply your effort the other reason you might not experience that is this that you are not walking by means of what you have You are not walking according to the Spirit that is in you, on the basis of God's life in you. You have never tapped it. You have never understood it. It has never been unleashed in you. You may be a believer and the power of God is in you, but you've never had it expressed out of you because you've lived your whole life according to, by the means of, not the Spirit, but according to, by the means of, your own effort. You have been controlled. You have been governed. You have let your life be controlled by external rules, little codes, little formulas. And the power of God has never been unleashed in you. The flesh we were very careful to define as well. And it even helps this whole concept come a little bit clearer. When we see the spirit, the concept of the spirit walk and the flesh walk contrasted. What is the flesh? The flesh we discovered last week is not being referred to here in this text as my physical body. Very often when we think of flesh, we think of something that is scummy, something that is dirty, something that makes me do bad things. Okay, that's the flesh. What is the flesh? It makes you do the bad thing. Romans 7, 18. Romans 6, 19 say this, in my flesh is no good thing. The infirmity of the flesh is spoken of in Romans 6. And so we discovered that the flesh, whatever it is, is weak. It is infirmed. But we were very careful to understand that while those are characteristics of the flesh, that is not a definition of the flesh. That's simply what the flesh does. Romans 7 was our key. Romans 7, 5 was the thing that opened the door, at least for me. I hope it helped you. And that was when Paul used the term flesh in this sense. He was saying these words, for while we were in the flesh. He was speaking in that place of a time in his life when he was not a born-again Christian, When he did not have that born-again, new life experience in Christ, the Spirit did not live in him. He was what we would call the natural man. He is without the Spirit, and he is living his life according to, by the means of, that which is natural. Life for him, therefore, if he is a natural man without the Spirit of God, life for him is limited to what is natural. He can't even tap the supernatural because he doesn't have it. Life for him is what he sees. Life for him is what he tastes, touches, feels, possesses, and acquires. That is what is real for him. That is what is truth for him. That's all there is for him. The desire of the flesh, therefore, when we come to this thing and it says, it will not carry out the desire of the flesh. What is the desire of the flesh? The desire of the flesh, if you want a definition, is simply this. The desire of the flesh is to find life, to find meaning, to find fulfillment in physical things, in things that I can taste, touch, feel, possess, and acquire for myself. That is the desire of the flesh. That is the pulling of the flesh to find life in those things. The problem is this. It's real simple. And that is that those things that I see, touch, taste, feel, and want to acquire for myself that will give me life can't do it. They can't do it. whether it be money, status, position, power, a nice house, a bigger house, a nice car, a pretty wife, good grades. If I am looking to those things to be the source of my life, they might all be good things, but they can't give me life. What's going to happen is I'm going to get frustrated. Because if life for me is money, if life for me is status, power, reputation, looking good, then my joy and my fulfillment and my peace is going to be dependent on having all those things. But I want to tell you, you lose either way. Because if my joy is dependent on having those things and I don't have them, I'm not going to have peace. I'm not going to have joy. I'm not going to have fulfillment. On the other hand, the other way you lose is finding my joy and peace in things that I see and touch and feel. Let's say you're in the position to really get it all. You have the money and you have the status and you have the position. The other problem you run into then is this. Those things can't give life. So you're frustrated on that end too. The works of the flesh then come from a basis of operation that says I am living my life according to what I taste, feel, touch. It is simply the natural result of seeking life in the natural realm of life. You will be frustrated, and you will have to protect everything you have. Strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger will flow from that. When your life is threatened, there can be no love, joy, peace, because life is in that. It operates like this. If life for me is in the natural, what I taste, touch, feel, on and on and on, then it follows that my joy and my peace and my patience is in having all those things. And if those things are not in order, I go berserk. You know why? Because life for me is in those things. And I spend my life working and striving and fretting and fighting to get what I can't have. Now, we see those patterns in the life of the unbeliever, don't you? I mean, we can hear pastors always talking about, you know, the billboards tell you that it's in sex, and it's in heaven this and heaven that, and it isn't true, is it? And we look at the unbelieving world and we go, aha, I see that in the unbelieving world. What we need to understand is Paul is speaking here to believers. Paul is addressing this, and he is saying a lot of Christians who have the Spirit of God and should be walking according to the Spirit of God that is in them are not walking at all according to the Spirit of God that is in them. They are instead walking according to what they taste, touch, feel, possess, and can acquire for themselves. They are therefore, in terms of victory and in terms of powerful living, not a whole lot different than the world. They do better behavior. Sometimes they keep in line and they're not blowing buildings up. But in terms of powerful, spirit-induced life, it is still all up to them. They're not tapping the power. They are living by the means of. Not what the spirit is leading them to do, but they are living by means of what they can achieve, what they can do, how they can perform, what they taste, touch, feel, possess. And life for them is trying hard. Life for them is trying hard. And with a natural control, with an external control, with a flesh control, they even are able sometimes to maintain or present a very Christian presentation. They look like good little Christians, but very often while they are kind of under control, there isn't any power. There isn't any glory. there's a tremendous lack of peace. There's a tremendous lack of joy. And we wonder why. David Needham in his book, Birthright, our young marriage, are studying this book in Sunday school, and I found it very, very helpful in my own study of the book of Galatians. Talks at one point in his book of what he calls carport Christianity. Very interesting illustration, and I think it helps us here. He says basically this, that many Christians are living their lives and the power provided by the battery. And he likens the battery to my will. My, I will do it. I will live the Christian life, you know. And all the imperatives of the Christian life are sitting before the believer. Be like God, be like Christ, be loving, be joyful. And I engage my will, which is the battery of my car, and I will be loving, and I will be joyful, and I will do it. You know, there are certain things you can do with a battery. Think about your car. There are certain things you can do with a battery. I think of when I was a little kid, I used to love cars. Couldn't wait until I turned 16. I remember the whole year before, my dad would let me drive up and down in the driveway, you know, and it was just great, you know. But before that, I could just sit in there, and I used to just like to play with all the gadgets. All sorts of things can run off the battery. You can turn your windshield wipers on. You can even get it to clean it, you know, provide it. It's a real function. I have a real ministry with the car here because it's going, and I clean the windows, and you can flash your lights on and off. You can put your blinkers and they blink. You can turn your radio on. If you've got a good stereo, you can really blast and edify the whole neighborhood. It's wonderful. But the thing is, and where this illustration goes, is that cars were not made just to wipe their wipers and to flash their lights and to play their radio. The car was made to move. And very often as Christians, we live like that little car in the carport. And we have our little things that we do. And we wipe our wipers and we flash our lights. And then we go to seminars, you know, and we find out how to play our radio better. High fidelity sound and all these kinds of things. But you know what? The scenery never changes. And we never move. And God is glorified in us not when we wipe our wipers and flash our lights and do little Christian things. God is glorified when we move. sometimes there are Christians and we begin to understand and we look at the Christian life and we go you know Christianity is more than just doing little religious things and I realized that God has called me to move in power and get somewhere and do something do something with my life and so we knowing that I was made to move, I begin to move. I start to move. But still, I start to do or try to do all the things that I'm called to do in the Word of God on the power of my battery. Some of you have stick shift cars. Now, they don't do this anymore. I think that when you have a stick shift now, if the clutch is up, you can't turn it on. Okay, but some of the older cars, some of these old pickups, you turn the ignition on, and if you don't, you can just make it lurch. Okay, on the power of the battery, you can make that car go, and you can move a little bit. You can move. Incredible illustration. I hope this is working for you. It helped me. I'm wasting a lot of time if it's not working. We can actually move, and we can begin to do some of the powerful things, but guess what? After a while, my battery sounds like this. You go about a block. Then you've got to get recharged. That's what church is for, right? Come back here. Dave will get me going. And you start going out, and you start running and living the Christian life on the power of that little battery you got, something's missing. Something's missing. It's called ignition. When the contact comes between the act of my will that would desire what God wants and the power of the Spirit, there is ignition, and I begin to move. The question comes, and I think it's a good one. David, you give that illustration, and I understand that it's the power of the Spirit, and Paul says, walk by the Spirit as if it's so simple. If it is so simple, then why is it so hard to live there? Why is it so hard? Because I find myself constantly finding periods in my life where I understand this. I find myself, maybe I go to a retreat or maybe I hear a specific sermon or I hear a song and all of a sudden it comes clear. I'm doing this whole thing in the flesh. I'm doing this whole thing just on the power of my own trying, and I'm worn out, and I'm tired, and I begin to move, and it's exciting and thrilling, but after a while, I go back to the same old thing. And it just creeps up on me, and it just works like this. Before I know it, I'm doing all this work, and I'm doing all these things, and I'm tired, I'm exhausted, the glory is gone. Why? I'll tell you why. There's a conflict. That's why. Verse 17, The flesh sets its desire against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh. The flesh sets its desire against the spirit. It means simply this. It means simply this. The flesh's function in my life is to get me to function according to that which is natural. It is to get me to function and draw my life from that which I see, taste, touch, feel, acquire, and possess. Life for me is this. Life for me is this church. That is flesh. Life for me is all the things I do. That is flesh. And that's going to wear you out faster than anything I know. By the way, I want you to know something about the flesh. The flesh does not whisper. The flesh does not whisper. This flesh is, again, it's a principle. It's a principle. It's saying, where is your life drawn from? What is life for you? It is what I see and what I taste and what I touch and what I do. Ah, that is life for me. What I accomplish. That is life. It doesn't whisper. Every billboard you go by, every advertisement you see, every TV show you watch says basically this. It gives you a philosophy of life. The philosophy is this. This is living. This is life. If you could have her, you'd be okay. If you could go there, you'd be okay. If you could accomplish this, you'd be okay. This is life. If you believe that, you will spend everything you have, every ounce of energy going after that to possess it, to have it, to acquire it. And from that will begin to flow the works of the flesh, which are enmities and strife and anger and lack of joy. Because if your life is in all these things, first, they can't give life. Secondly, it'll never happen. to the Christian the flesh comes and says this life for you is all you do life for you is all the ministries you have all you do for God not just God anymore but all you do for God the flesh comes and says it's up to you pal you better just grit your teeth and do it you want to know something we, people who fall into this trap of even trying to do things God's called us to do, good things, according to or by means of the flesh, people who fall into that trap are generally people who really care about the things of the Lord. Happens to pastors. I shared with you last week how it happened to me. Life for me very subtly became the church, became the goals I had, it became the money that was coming in, it became all these external things. And the way I knew that those things had become life for me was because I had a lack of joy, a lack of peace, a lack of love. Because when those things that had become life for me became threatened, I had to have them. What we need to know is that when we begin to move on the power of my battery, it is sin. And I'll tell you something else. It is not only sin, it is sin. It is sin. in the work of the flesh. No joy, no peace. I don't have time to go into this real heavily, but in Romans 7, we have a real clear testimony from the Apostle Paul concerning what this whole thing is, what this struggle, this conflict is all about. I would like you to turn in your Bibles after the sermon. I don't have time to go into it now. You're going to have to trust me, okay? Verses 15 through 19, verses 22 through 23 describes Paul's struggle. You're pretty familiar with it. He says things like this, that which I would not, that do I do. And the very thing I want to do, I don't do. And the wishing is in me. And I joyfully concur with the law of God. In my heart, I want to do what God wants me to do. But I constantly find myself not doing the very thing that I want to do. What's his problem? What's his problem? He's not trying hard enough. The wishing is in me, he says. The very thing I want to do, I don't do. It's not about trying hard. He doesn't really mean it. It's not about not really meaning it. This is a man. He calls himself at the end of that chapter, Oh, wretched man that I am. The thing I want to do more than anything in the world is do what God called me to do. And I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying. I can't do it. You know where it breaks open? It breaks open in Romans chapter 8. Oh, I have to read it. Romans chapter 8, verses 3 and 4. and you know what he realizes here? He realizes that he wasn't working hard enough. No. He doesn't realize that. He realizes this, that everything he was working to achieve, God already did. Get it? He realized that everything he was working to achieve, God already did. That was a song that Mike sang. Where he had failed was not in not trying hard enough. He just didn't believe God. Read this, verse 3 and 4. For what the law could not do, weak as it was, through the flesh, my trying hard, big words, God did, done. How? Sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and as an offering for sin he condemned sin in the flesh. In order that the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, here's this, who do not walk according to the flesh, what I taste, touch, feel, possess, acquire for myself, but according to the Spirit, tapping the power of God in me. Then it says in verse 18, but if you're led by the Spirit, you're not under law. You know what that means? I don't have time to go into that either, deeply. Maybe we'll hit that Wednesday night a little bit. Simply means this, if the Spirit of God is leading you, if the Spirit of God is the one who's in control of your life, what in the world would you need a law for? What in the world would you need some external code telling you to not do that? That is not the control of your life anymore. Colossians 2 says this. Why have you subjected yourselves to decrees such as do not handle, do not touch? If the Spirit is leading you, you don't need those things. The Spirit of God will lead you into freedom. He will lead you into holiness. He will lead you into truth. He will lead you into fruit. He will lead you into prayer. He will lead you into assurance of your salvation. He will lead you into witnessing. He will lead you into submission. If He is really indeed doing those things, why would you need a law? You don't. That's the point. Then we get to the contrast. You get to the contrast, verses 19 through 23, and this is where it gets practical, and all God's people said, whew, it's about time. Face it, listen, this has been the struggle I've had with this whole thing. You see, no matter how hard you try to explain it, no matter how hard you search for illustrations that will crystallize it, concepts like flesh and spirit are abstract concepts. They are hard to grasp. The best way to grasp them, even Paul understands, is by an illustration. And what he does is he looks at behavior. He says it's almost as if, wake up everybody. Okay, forget everything I just said. Here's a way to help you. The best way to know in your own spirit, whether you are walking indeed by the indwelling spirit, or you are walking indeed by everything you see outside of yourself, even trying to do good things, is this. Look inside of yourself and ask yourself, is the characteristic of my life an abiding peace? If it isn't, you're not walking by the Spirit. It is the characteristic of my life in abiding joy, even in circumstances that are negative. If it isn't, the reason you are lacking joy is because life for you is in what is external, what is outside of yourself that is now being threatened. Real concrete terms. Real concrete terms. If life for you is in the natural realm, you will evidence it by the works of the flesh. If life for you is in the supernatural realm, if it is in the Spirit, if life for you is God, it will evidence itself by the fruit of the Spirit. It's very revealing because it exposes to me where I really do put my life, what I really do draw my life from. It exposes me every time. Let's look at it real quickly. We're going to hit the flesh today. We're not going to get to the fruit at all. The deeds of the flesh are evident. It means this. They are open. They are obvious. They are well known to everyone. Comes in four categories and I think they're very interesting. Comes in the category of sex. Comes in the category of religion. Comes in the category of relationships. And it comes in the category of an outlook of life. An outlook on life. First of all, sex. The work of the flesh is evidenced in sex. Sexual behavior. Very interesting to me that it starts with sex. And I'll tell you why. And I'm talking to believers right now. And I have dealt with so many people in this particular area that I really believe that what I'm saying is true. I believe that for many people in this place right now, the problem of sex specifically, let's talk about lust. The problem of lust is that little secret problem that nobody even knows about in your family, among your friends. It is locked away and you have, many of you, have even given up hope of ever having victory here. It's that little secret thing. never to be revealed. But here today, you're going to know the answer. You'll leave with victory. We'll see. Deeds of the flesh, first of all, the area of sex. Verse 19. Real specific. Now the deeds of the flesh are evident. They're obvious. They're open to all. Immorality, impurity, sensuality. Let me define the words real quickly. Immorality, pornea. Simply, we get our word pornography. It means sexual sin. Okay? Leave it at that. Let your mind wander. You know what that means. Impurity. Impurity is not the activity of immorality. Impurity deals more with the attitude than the deed. Impurity is the lust. Impurity is the obsession with those things. Immorality speaks of the deed. Impurity speaks of the heart. Impurity speaks of the attitude behind the deed. Sensuality is simply literally this. You kind of get the wrong idea with sensuality. It's lasciviousness is what it means. Looseness without restraint in terms of sexual things. Work of the flesh is that. It is without restraint. It is pornography, it is perversion of sex, and it is impurity in my thinking. Ask you, why are sexual things so gripping? Even for a Christian, you know? Christians aren't supposed to have sexual thoughts, right? Right. Good, I'm going to go talk to another group. I'll tell you why I think it has such a grip. First of all, it is physical. It is a tangible thing. you know we talk about these flesh principles and there are these abstract thoughts that I got to try to work on to get sexual drives and things like that I don't have to work up some idea about what that means they're in me they're tangible second reason it's good what? yeah it's good we're going to move into Proverbs in a couple weeks and we're going to do two or three weeks on sexual things in terms of where Proverbs gives us some tremendous instruction in that area One of the dimensions of love is the eros love. Eros love. Erotic love. And when it is directed by the Spirit, when it is in the confines of marriage, eros love is absolutely delightful and fulfilling and a gift from God. So I have this in me, and it's something that God has given to me. And in certain parameters, it is a good thing. but when it is applied to that which is outside the confines that God has intended fulfillment to be I run into all sorts of problems third problem, third reason it has such a pull on me is that it is absolutely everywhere it is absolutely everywhere, I cannot get away from it I don't have to seek that out, I don't have to seek out anything that will pull on that eros in me I don't have to, it comes at me, I drive home, I see billboards It sells toothpaste. It sells blue jeans. It sells cars. Everything. It pulls on that eros in you, that good thing that is in you, but it twists it. It can be a powerful thing. How do you beat it? How do you beat it? How do you defeat this thing? Make a rule. No hanky-panky. It is a no-no. no fornication thou shalt not you know when i say that some of you think he's saying that that doesn't matter yes i am it does matter it is the law of god do thou shalt not commit adultery fornication okay what we need to realize and open our eyes to is this that because there is a rule that does not restrain me. It never did. Old Testament it never did. David when he looked at Bathsheba thou shalt not. He knew the problem in sin is not often knowledge. It is something inside me that I can't control that takes possession of me and the law doesn't keep me from doing it. I know it's wrong. It is wrong. It's a good rule. It doesn't help me not do it. I talk to people often who struggle in this area and they come to me and the problem that they have is not at all that the law is not clear to them they know it is they know what is right and what is wrong in this area what they don't have is any power to control it try hard that's the advice you'll get from the pastor try hard not to lust ready get set go you got a lustful thought don't think that thought okay you try hard the harder you try, the worse it gets. You know, the Bible confirms that. The power of sin is the law. The power of sin is the law. As soon as you say, don't do it, I want to do it. That's the power of the law. As soon as you say, don't do it, I go, oh boy, that might be good. Okay, trying hard doesn't work. Make them feel guilty. It's dirty, it's rotten, it's scummy. and I just load you with all sorts of guilt so that whenever you are confronted with an erotic situation that you have an opportunity to move into, I just have this overwhelming sense of guilt and I go, no, no, I won't do it. Some of you that works. Some of you it doesn't. You still feel guilty, you do it anyway. And the guilt is overwhelming. But that power of guilt for some of you is enough. The problem is this, I'm afraid, And again, what I'm going to say here, I'm going to throw this out, I can't deal with it anymore, and I'm just throwing it out with the knowledge that we're going to deal with it extensively when we go to Proverbs in a couple weeks with this. I'm afraid that some Christians have used this approach, make them feel guilty, and that'll kind of keep them chaste until they get married. They have done that so well and made them have a perception of sex that it is so yucky that it does indeed keep them chaste and proper before marriage. It also keeps them that way after marriage. and when it comes time to express fully that which God has given to them as an expression of love and something that is to be enjoyed and wonderful they are literally incapable of doing it the word is impotent dysfunctional and beloved that is very sad that is very sad so what do you do about sex what do you do about the lust of sex. Paul says, walk by the Spirit and you won't carry out. Desire is lust. Simple. See ya. We try. That won't work. That won't work. That is a namby-pamby answer and it's just a little band-aid and it doesn't work in real life, Dave. Give me a break. I'm going to tell you this. You're absolutely right. If what you mean by walking by the Spirit means some floaty, sentimental feeling and you're relying on some floaty, sentimental feeling about really thinking God's a neat guy and I ought to do what he says, if that's what you're relying on to defeat this kind of thing, you're going to get blown out of the water. I think, beloved, that walking by the Spirit in this particular situation comes down to a matter of what you believe. That's simple. What you believe. Let me explain. The flesh says, natural thinking says, life for you is found in pleasure, in power, in gratification of your senses and gratification of your physical glands. That is where life is. So if I could possess her or if I could possess him or if I could experience that experience, then I'll be okay. Then I'll be full. That's life. You want to know something? It comes down to what you believe. If you believe that, if you believe that life and fulfillment is found in the simple gratification of everything you feel, then there is no law that will keep you from doing it. Think on that. There is no rule that will keep you from seeking what you believe life to be. No law will do it. Nothing will restrain you. And you could have had the best home and you could have heard the principles all your life, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it and you'll have them ringing in your brain while you're doing it. Because life for me is what I taste and what I touch and what I feel, what I possess and what I have. And the Spirit at the same time says, David, it's a lie. It's a lie. Life for you is not there. You can go and get it and you can have it and every one of you know it is available to you in some way or another, even in the thoughts. But that is not life. In fact, that will be destruction for you. and it comes down to what you think life really is. What is life for me? When I look at that erotic thing, I'm no different than you. Those things pull on me just like you and they have a pull in me and a question comes to me when I see that or have opportunity for that. The question is simply this. What is life for me? Is life what I taste, touch, feel, possess? If it is, then nothing could stop me. If life for me is God and my relationship to Him and He says to me, thou shalt not life for me my meat is to do the will of the one in whom I find my life and the one from whom I draw my life that doesn't even appeal to me it's a lie it's a lie that life is there in this physical thing but you know what, want to know something? if you don't believe it's a lie nothing will keep you from going that way for life if life for you is pleasure there's no rule that's going to hold you back But I say walk by the Spirit and you won't fulfill the lesson. Let's look at religion. Okay? You understand that? Here's another application. That's all this is another application. Religion. Idolatry, sorcery. Idolatry. Idolatry is simply this. Finding my life in what I have erected for myself. Okay? Idolatry is... You know, I preached a sermon on this a few weeks ago, so I don't want to go into this in real depth. But idolatry is not some guy going in a temple, biting off the tongue of a lizard, sprinkling the blood, and going, how do you know about it? You know, those pagans, idolatry is giving to some object or some work that I have done or something that I have created or something that I'm doing and thinking that that is what is life for me. And I believe it fits into this religious section because very often it is just those religious kinds of things that we do that are good things on the outside but they become for me my life. They become for me an idol. Again, I would refer to the ministry, because this is my perspective. All of a sudden, I'm walking by the Spirit, and the Spirit is producing in me love, joy, peace. He is also producing a work of the ministry, which is affecting the body of Christ, and it is building it up, and there's something glorious. Okay? Something begins to happen, and it's good. And it gets to be built. Huh? And it's good. But all of a sudden, without my even knowing it, my focus changes. Rather than life for me being God, ignoring everything else, even though things are building, my life turns over here to all these things that are being built. Wow, this is great. More people every Sunday. Offering is getting better. We're moving on in faith. Isn't that great? Before I know it, life for me becomes all the good things I'm doing. Idolatry. And if that is for me life, I will lose my joy, I will lose my peace, I will lose my love because if people begin to threaten what I have erected and I'm doing for myself, if they begin to threaten what I am doing, I'll hate them. I'll hate them. Relationships. Life for you, let's say, is status. Sports. Some of you find life in sports. Isn't that neat? Nothing wrong with sports. Some of you find life in status. Some of you find life in what people think of you. And if that is true, you'll do whatever it takes to get it. when we walk according to the flesh when we walk according to what is natural I'll fight to keep that when you threaten it therefore what is the result? the result is all sorts of hatreds, enmities strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger hatreds are internal strife is external, it's the expression of my hatred jealousy, you know what jealousy simply is? jealousy is simply looking at someone who has achieved what I think life is and I don't have it. They have achieved all the things that I think life holds, and I don't have it, and I am jealous. Some people have jealousy stirred up in them when they see somebody who does indeed have peace and joy and patience and love, and it stirs up in them because they know that even though they're doing all these things, they don't have any of those things. Outbursts of anger, and on and on and on. outlook on life that was simply the best way I could deal with drunkenness and carousing I believe that a way to look at that is simply this it is when I discover that all the things I thought were life weren't that it was a lie and you know what I say I say basically this it's all vanity vanity, vanity all is vanity there is no life, there is no fulfillment eat, drink and be merry drunkenness and carousing but I say walk by the spirit and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh this is not a sermon that says don't do those things I'm not saying don't be immoral because if your life if life for you is in physical things there's no rule that's going to stop you from going for it what I want to ask you this morning every one of you is this, what is life for you? that's the question, what is life for you? is it in what you taste and touch and feel and possess and are acquiring? if it is, it will be evidenced with lack of fruit and presence of the work of the flesh anger if you are perpetually angry would you take that as a signal from God that you're getting life from something that can't give it? I don't even know where it is for you. But you're getting life. If you are constantly plagued by a lack of peace, would you take that as a clue that you are getting your life from something that cannot give it? If you are perpetually plagued with a lack of joy and all of these things that were supposed to come to me when I was a Christian, would you just take that as a gentle nudge from the Spirit of God that says, you are not drawing your life from me. You're drawing it from something you see, from something you taste, from what people think. the question is this what is life for you I don't know what the spirit is saying to you this morning I have two concerns in my heart and that is this for those of us for those of you in our congregation this morning who don't even have the presence of the spirit who have never asked Jesus to come into their heart and I would ask I would have an invitation that is just open to you that if you would make that commitment and receive Jesus as your savior and place your trust in him the spirit will come and indwell you and you will be able to begin to live this kind of life. But also to those of you who are indeed believers and have never tapped a resource, this morning you may need to let go of all those things that are life for you. And if you need help to do that and pray about it, would you just come and we'll pray. Thank you.
