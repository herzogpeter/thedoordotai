For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray as we go to the Word. Now, God, as we sit at your feet, make our hearts soft places for your words to land. Make our hearts soft places for your words to land and give us what we need. Amen? All right, turn your Bibles, if you have them, or your iPhones, or your Droids, or your iPads, or whatever you have, turn then them to Colossians chapter 3, starting in verse 12. where we continue our study in Colossians. I want to read these verses to you. Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, lest we forget that, clothe yourselves with compassion and kindness and humility and gentleness and patience and bear with each other. and forgive one another. If any of you has a grievance against someone and forgive as the Lord forgave you and over all these virtues, put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. Now in a wedding or at a church service, those words sound beautiful, don't they? Put on compassion. put on kindness bear with each other forgive each other and over all those things love each other at a wedding or in a church service we look at each other when we hear those words and we smile and oh man they sound so sweet but if all they do is sound sweet we've missed their message entirely this Tuesday morning as I was sitting in my study reading the next few verses in our in our study I read those words and when I got to the words bear with each other honestly the first reaction I had and it wasn't the first reaction just the first reaction it was the second one and the third one and the 50th one and the 51st one was no. It was, I don't know that I can do that. If I'm really honest, to bear with someone else. See, to be compassionate or kind or patient is the kind of thing you can do like in a grocery line. Like, you know, oh, you only have one item. I have 75. Go ahead. I am compassionate I am kind I put them on but when it comes to bearing with one another it speaks to a kind of long term looking at someone in the face and saying I see every ugly part of you and I've experienced it and it's hurt me but I'm bearing with you. So, understanding that that's probably what it meant, I decided to do some language study because, you know, every once in a while you look in the Greek and that gives you a parachute because what you thought it meant it really didn't mean. It kind of lets you off the hook, right? Well, what bearing with one another means in this sense is to stand up as straight as you can and hold someone else up. It means to endure someone. When do you have to endure someone? When they're at their worst moment. It means to delay punishment. It means even when the perfect opportunity to say that thing that will put them in their place and they deserve it and they need to hear it, when that thing happens, you go, oh, I'm going to bear with you. Doesn't mean you don't say the hard thing, doesn't mean you don't say the straight truth, but when it means when it comes from a place in you that would punish them, and you know exactly what I mean, right? You instead bear with them. So to all of that emotion, what rose up in me was, I am empty of some things I need. if I'm going to bear with people. I am empty of the kind of compassion I would need to really do that day after day after day. And I'm empty of the kind of kindness that I really need to do that moment after moment after moment, not just in the grocery store, but with the people I love the most, which ironically are the hardest people to love. Amen? Well, so, I also thought, and I am so full of the kinds of things that are going to kill me and kill any chance I have to bear with someone else. Things like slander and malice and rage. The things I read just a few verses ago that we were to put off. Which, and also made me think in my Tuesday morning little office over my coffee and staring at a blank wall where post-it notes should start filling it, which would fill out my talk, but it was empty. I thought, man, we have been drinking from a fire hose in Colossians 3. Haven't we? I mean, all that stuff, put off this, put on this, death to life, it has been intense. So what I want to do this morning is teach you a word that any student of Jesus needs to take seriously. Any student that wants to grow spiritually needs to learn this word, and the word is pause. Pause. When you're called to love someone, and when you look down into the reservoir of love, and it's like you yell down there, and it echoes back at you with emptiness. Any love in there? And you say, I have no love to give. Instead of charging forward and doing it more and faking it till you make it and keeping pressing on and putting your head down and making sure it's gonna work, maybe it's time to pause and say to God, oh God, I am so empty of that which I need right now. Oh God, I am so full of that which will never help me right now. And if you don't give me something at this intersection of my life, I am done. If you do not know how to do that, if you don't give yourself the courage, if you don't give yourself the freedom to stop and say, oh God, then it's going to be a long road. Because I think this is true, that Jesus meets us at the intersection of empty and full with an invitation. If we're full of the things that are never gonna help us learn to love and be compassionate and bear with one another, then Jesus will meet us there and he will give us an invitation that helps us become empty of those things. And if we are empty of the things that we really need, things like courage and Jesus, Jesus will meet us there at that empty place and will invite us into fullness. I want to tell you a story about how that happens. A story is found in Mark chapter 6. It's a story that you're all very familiar of. It's a story of the feeding of the 5,000. But I'll read it to you because I want to pull out some thoughts that perhaps will help. So Mark chapter 6, verse 30 and 31, we read this. The apostles, or disciples, at this particular stage in their journey, gathered around Jesus, and they reported to him all that they had done and taught. And then we read, then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some what? Rest. Now, this is a really interesting thing, because what they're saying basically is this. Jesus, look at all we've done! And I don't think this is coming from a weird, prideful place. I think it's coming from an excited place. Peter's like, you know how Jesus normally, I just talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and people don't really listen to me? Like, I taught and people listened. And they were helped. And then one of the other disciples said, yeah, and I healed this guy. This guy was blind and I prayed for his eyes and all of a sudden he opened them up and he could see. It was amazing. Look at all that we've done. We are the center of activity. And there's still people gathering around so much so that we didn't have time to eat. I mean, it's like, I wasn't even hungry. It's amazing. I'm just doing all this stuff. Jesus, it's so awesome. To which Jesus doesn't say, well, what are you doing? Hanging out here for? Get back out there. He says this very interesting thing. He says, oh, you guys, it's time to come away with me. so that you can rest. Oh, you guys. It's time to pause. Oh, you guys, bless you. But it's time to stop. The invitation that we receive is this. From Jesus, in the middle of our success, in the middle of our activity, in the middle of our striving and trying and going and running and doing is this, come away with me. Now this makes no sense, especially to those of us who are really good at getting things done. To those of us who just are good at doing and achieving and bottom lines, making sure the graph goes up and to the right, hearing this message, come away with me. stop what you're doing, the good things that you're doing, so that you can rest is absolutely crazy, right? Why would we do that? I'm doing good things. I'm not doing all these bad things. I mean, what? To you, person who's getting it all right and achieving so much, Jesus has an invitation for you today. and I think this is a word for some of you right now and the word is pause and come away with me to rest. There's another group of people I think that aren't very good at achieving but you're really good at trying hard. You're trying so hard to get it right, whatever it is. Loving your spouse well, raising your kids well, doing a good job at your job, being a good roommate, being someone who makes sure they're compassionate and kind and patient with every single person that you run across. And you're so tired, and all you hear is keep going and keep charging and keep moving. But what you end up needing is the thing that you never are invited into, and that is rest. Am I speaking to anyone? And the word for you this morning, this invitation from Jesus is come away with me so that you can rest. You ever notice even that word sounds restful? You can't say rest and have it sound like violent. Rest! It doesn't work. Rest. And by rest, I really think Jesus means come away with me. Not so that you can read 17 chapters in your Bible, now that might be a really good idea for a different time but if you really need rest what you need is rest you need to come to Jesus and rest with no agenda and no resources and nothing else except for you and Jesus and you guys the times that I've tried to do this he's gotten away from things and sat in a comfortable chair my mind starts thinking what am I going to have for dinner? Oh, I'm hungry. Oh, how long do you think it's okay until I eat? Oh, I think it's okay if I have that donut? Oh, probably not okay. I'm resting here. Is resting a part of eating? You know, that's where I go. And then you know what happens? After just a little while I start getting really tired. And then you know what I do? I sleep for like three hours at like 10 in the morning. That's awesome. He's like, I would never sleep at 10 in the morning. What are you doing, bro? I sleep because I need rest. Most of us, the most spiritual thing that you can do is turn it off and sleep. Turn it off. It doesn't mean that what you leave won't be in shambles when you get back. You might leave a thing, even for a couple of hours, and come back and it's in chaos. Moses leaves for 40 days, a month, his community, to receive from God the Ten Commandments. When he walks down that mountain, what does he find? These guys are worshiping a golden calf. I mean, Moses wasn't going like, I leave you guys for five minutes. You're worshiping an animal. It's not even an animal. You may need to leave and come back and find things broken down, but you still need to leave. and rest. Some of you need to rest right now. I mean right now. Is that a snore? I think that was. For some of you, the most spiritual thing you could do right now is fall asleep. And I'm not kidding. Well, the story goes on. Mark 6, verse 32. We read this. So they went by themselves. They took the invitation. They went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. Notice the word solitary. What does that mean? It should mean quiet, right? Alone. But, worst word in the English language, but, many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. Unbelievable, right? You finally carved out space. You're going to rest. You're going to get away from all the craziness. And these crazy people beat you there. They're like, unbelievable. Well, when Jesus sees them, because he is full of compassion, his response is that he has compassion on them because they were so lost. They're like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach them many things. And then between many things and by this time, there's like many hours that pass, and the disciples are sitting there, having gotten away, being really hungry, because remember, they hadn't gotten anything to eat, sitting around thinking, oh, Jesus, he's going to give a talk. They're pretty short, you know. I mean, blessed are the poor. That's kind of one talk. Blah, blah, blah. But it goes on and on and on all day, and then they're like, who's going to go tell him and send these people away from here? John, you do it. He loves you, right? So one of them walks up and goes, Jesus, this is a remote place. It's already super late. Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and pubs and whatever, wherever it is they might find something to buy, to eat. Send them out of here. This is our time. This is our rest. This is for us. Send them away. And that's a legitimate request, right? Jesus invited them to a solitary place. My voice is doing solitary place. Okay, solitary place. Jesus says to them this sentence, which is unbelievable, right? He looks at them and goes, well, these people are hungry. You give them something to eat. Now, if you're the disciples, you're like, are you kidding me? And you would think there's a small problem here. We don't have enough. There's like 10,000 people out there. We have a little bit of food for us, maybe. There is not enough. Now, I think that little phrase up there on the screen, there is not enough, is the primary phrase that goes through our minds most of the day. There's not enough time. There's not enough money. there's not enough energy there's not enough love there's not enough there's not enough there is not enough and so our response is either to give up or to crank it out there's not enough well I'm going to make enough I'm going to crank it out I'm going to keep I'm going to do it more I'm going to be the hero here I'm going to make it happen I will make there be enough I will do it I always have I always will. I'm the person to do it. I can do it. I will do it. I can control it. Anyone in this room like that? Yeah, thank you for being honest. Well, what Jesus invites us into in those moments where we say, I can do it, or this thing that I thought I needed, I'm not going to get right now, this place that I've carved out for rest. I'm not getting. Jesus invites us to let go of that thing that we thought we needed. Now, what I'm not saying is that your needs don't matter. Sometimes you need rest, and you need to get it, and it needs to happen. But many times in life, the thing that you carve out time for and space for, when you get there, you find out it's no longer available to you in the way that you thought it would be, and you don't get what you need. Anyone ever been on vacation? Then the first day you get back, you're like, I feel like I never, I feel like I didn't even leave. Oh my gosh, that was a week, and now it's gone. I don't feel rested. I don't feel ready to come back. Jesus invites us to wonder if maybe we needed something else. Maybe what we really needed, we haven't even voiced yet. Maybe what we need, we're afraid to voice because we're afraid it'll never come. Maybe what we need the most, we're afraid to voice because maybe it'll never come. Mark 6, 37. To this response that Jesus issued to them, you feed them. They said, well we could but it would take almost a year's wages are we to go and spend that much money on bread and give it to them to eat we'll do it judas has probably you know stolen half the money already anyway he's our treasurer but whatever's left we'll buy bread for him we will well then jesus asked them this amazing question and it's the question for all of humanity it's the question that we fight wars over it's the question that we break up families over it's the question that friendships dissolve over, and the question is this, how many loaves do you have? And we look down on our hands, and our answer is, not enough. Not enough. How many loaves do you have? Not enough. If I give you my loaf, I won't have a loaf. I'm not giving you my loaf, or I'll give you my loaf, and then I'll traipse through life as a victim. I have no loaf. That's not funny, actually. right? That wasn't supposed to be funny. You heartless, uncompassionate people. Well, the problem that we identify when we are asked that question, how many loaves do you have, is this. If I give away my loaf, it'll cost me way too much. I don't, I can't, I can't do it. Bear with one another? No. I can't do it. I don't have it in me. I don't have enough. there's not enough loaves what's in my hands is not going to suffice and the invitation that Jesus gives is this believe that you have more than you think now that sounds very ethereal until you read the end of the story Mark 6 41 and 43 Jesus takes the five loaves which is what they had which is awesome they gave them him what they had not much five loaves two fish and looking up to the heaven he gave thanks and he broke the loaves and he gave them to his disciples to set before the people and he also divided the two fish among them all and they all ate and were satisfied and the disciples picked up 12 basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish and the thing i want you to see in this story is when Jesus broke that bread and broke those fish apart and he gave them to his disciples to hand out, he put them in their hands. And those disciples look down in their own hands and their thought was, this is not enough. Because it had not multiplied yet. Think about it. I mean, it wasn't like the moment Jesus broke it, it was like this Mario Brothers, you know, and this mountain of bread and fish was just gathering speed and, oh my gosh, overtaking us. If it would have, then people would have just clamored. They would have forgot about sitting down in 50s and 100s. They would have just gone to the pile. Really, Jesus gave them a little tiny bit of bread and said, now go feed people. And so they walked away going, this isn't going to be enough. But here you go. And they looked down on their hands, and there was more. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. And no matter how much they gave, there was always enough. You guys. When it comes to Jesus, no matter how much you give, there is always enough for you. So to those of you who are wondering, how could I possibly give this away? The mystery of the gospel says this, I will fill you up with what you need, every crevice of your being. And the more you give away, the more you have, because that's how it works in my kingdom. It doesn't multiply until it gets given away. now when we're empty of what we need Jesus provides us a way to be full and when we're full of what we don't need Jesus provides us a way to be empty for in him we live and move and have our being and that's not poetry that's the greediest reality for those of us who call ourselves Jesus followers in him we live and give and cry and succeed and fail and we move and our whole being is caught up in this person named Jesus who gives us all that we need. And apart from him, we can do nothing. Nothing. Not one thing. 2 Corinthians 9, 8, Paul writes this. It's a great way to wrap this whole teaching up. And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over. No matter how many times you give it away, you'll look down on your hands and you'll go, oh, there's more. There's more, there's more. Plenty to share with others. So when you have the courage to stop and be honest about what you are empty of and what you are full of and what you need. Jesus meets you there and says, I have enough for you. Yes, you. Amen. Amen.
