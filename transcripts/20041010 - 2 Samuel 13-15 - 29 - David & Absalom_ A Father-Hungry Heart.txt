Amen. Richard Rohr in his book Wild Man's Journey says, most men and women too, grow up with an emptiness inside of them. Call it father hunger. Call it male deprivation. Call it lack of fathering. No matter, it's the same emptiness. When positive masculine energy, an energy that can be trusted and relied upon, is not shared from father to son, from father to daughter, even broaden the paradigm out beyond that. from generation to the next generation, when that does not happen, it creates a vacuum in the soul and into that vacuum, demons rush. Demons of self-doubt, fear, mistrust, cynicism, and rage. End quote. I want you to open your Bibles, if you have them with you, to 2 Samuel 15 as we continue what we have been calling for over a year now, a journey of the heart using the life of David is found in 1 and 2 Samuel as the guide to our journey. We come today to the story of David and Absalom, a story of father hunger, if there ever was one. I've entitled this sermon and probably what will turn out to be a series of sermons, David and Absalom, a father hungry heart. We've already met David. I'd like to introduce you, therefore, to Absalom first this morning. He was one of David's sons. At one time regarded as one of his favorite sons, he is known most widely for his angry rebellion against his father, the king. A rebellion that began to manifest itself in 2 Samuel 15 verse 1. Let's kind of just jump into the story by the reading of the text. If you don't have your Bibles, the verses will be on the screen for you to follow. Now it came about after this that Absalom provided for himself a chariot and horses and 50 men as runners before him. And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way to the gate. And it happened that when any man had a suit to come to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, from what city are you? And he would say, your servant, me, I am from one of the tribes of Israel. Then Absalom would say to him, see, your claims are good and right, but no one listens to you on the part of the king, do they? Moreover, Absalom would say, oh, that one would appoint me to judge the land. Then every man who has a suit or cause could come to me and I would do the right thing. I would give him justice. Well, I think it's pretty obvious what Absalom is doing here. He is using people's general discontent to draw them to himself to slowly but surely undermine David's authority by questioning David's heart to people who kind of had questions anyway, saying your claims are right and good, but no one will listen to you on behalf of the king. He doesn't care about you. He won't listen to you. Oh, but if I were king, things would be different. You would be heard there. There would be justice. Now, Absalom, according to chapter 14, verse 25, was exceedingly handsome and highly praised. I don't know why that verse would be in there except to get the understanding or the picture of Absalom in symbol that he was an attractive person to whom people were attractive. He was charismatic, what I think was probably a born leader, just like his dad. And I promise you, he was working all of that when in chapter 15, verse 5, a man came to him and bowed down to him because he was the son of the king. But Absalom wouldn't let him bow down to him. It says in verse 5, he picked him up, embraced him, and kissed him, kind of treating him like an equal. And you just look at the picture on the surface and you think of Absalom, how humble, how gentle. Problem is that guy he's hung, hugging and kissing there is being played like a violin. Verse six, it says, so in this manner, in this same way of being by the gate and undermining the king and hugging people, I'm for you. In that manner, Absalom dealt with all of Israel, with everyone who came to the king for judgment of some kind. With open arms and slippery words, he sympathized. With open arms and slippery words, he understood. He was the understanding one. Your claims are right and good. You've been mistreated. No one will listen to you, certainly not the king, because he just doesn't care. Oh, but if I were king, things would be difference. I wish I could help. My hands are tied. I'm not the king, but give me a hug and a kiss. Give me a hug and a kiss. That's verse 5. Verse 6, so Absalom, or in that way, Absalom stole away the hearts of the people. That's not very deep into the story, but I already want you to stop and notice something right here about which we cannot afford to be naive. It's this. That while Absalom is functioning here in physical ways, we can see and discern there is, I believe, a spirit functioning here or spirits, plural, functioning here. I'm talking principalities and powers here that are landing on, involved in, and all around what Absalom is doing by the city gates. The most obvious spirit or spirits that are at work in this scene through Absalom is a spirit of division and a spirit of control. I am not talking about a divisive attitude. I am not talking about a controlling personality. I am talking about a divisive spirit, a controlling spirit. It is a spirit that functions to usurp, to bring down rightfully God-ordained authority by means of manipulation. Where do you see the manipulation in the story? Absalom, by the gate, behind the scenes, with pretense of concern. There's nothing direct about this. It's all behind the back. It's manipulation. Function to usurp by means of manipulation for the purpose of control, controlling spirit. Where do you see that? If I were king, Absalom wanted to be king. He wanted control. and the only way to get that control is to usurp by means of manipulation through the back door at the gate by their forming alliances with people who would maybe believe what Absalom said about the king who really didn't know the king but say, well, if Absalom says that, it must be true forming alliances with people who maybe had little grievances of their own against the king but wouldn't go directly to the king because Absalom intercepted them before they got there, saying, your grievances are right and good. You've been mistreated. The king will never listen to you. You don't even guard the king. Just come to me if I were king. It is a spirit, beloved, that almost always operates from a place of perceived powerlessness. In other words, the person who falls victim to this, the Absalom, is a person who sees himself as being powerless. That's why they're not direct. It is a spirit that will land on, be around, and easily use people who do not have a strong sense of self. They feel powerless. They are internally weak people. But what's confusing about that revelation is that very often these people do not look weak at all. Absalom was exceedingly handsome and highly praised. To look at him, he was the picture of virile strength. He was internally weak, which is precisely why he was incapable of being direct. When this spirit of control, when a spirit of divisiveness is in control, that spirit is incapable of being direct, the spirit went functioning. And Absalom, when he was doing what he was doing, did what he did at the gate. behind the scenes. They do their usurping by means of manipulation, but it's all about control. I want to be king. Oh, if I were king, things would be different. Now, hear me on this. The ultimate expression and embodiment of this spirit, while it could be named many things, the ultimate expression and embodiment of this spirit is Satan himself. Lucifer, who is known as being among other things, primarily the what? Usurper. Who was cast from heaven because he sought first of all to usurp who? God. And when he fell, he brought with him a host of angels with him. I don't know if you remember the story in scripture as it's given account. Lucifer was seen to be the most beautiful of all the angels. He was exceedingly handsome and full of favor from whoever was there. It's a type of Absalom is what we've got here. And Lucifer in heaven, if you will, fell with other angels who then became demons, but it was an alliance that was formed even there. And those who went with Lucifer went with Lucifer. ultimately getting what he got. And when Satan fell from hell, he, like Absalom, stood by the gate, as it were, in the Garden of Eden, and said to even effect, your claims are right and good. You've been mistreated. God's holding out on you. Not eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Oh, man, God's holding out on you. He's afraid of what you're going to know if you take that. God doesn't care about you. He won't listen to you, but if I were king, If I were the prince and the power of the air, if I were the God of this world, if you would bow down to me and people did and people have and we are living in the result of an Absalom rebellion in heaven on earth, this is huge what I'm talking about. And wherever it is you see this, you are dealing with a very powerful spirit. Oh, it's just Bob. No, it's not just Bob. Any more than it's just Absalom. Something bigger is going on when you are around someone who sits by the gate, talks about somebody else, indirect, run for your life. I'm not kidding. This spirit of division and control that functions to usurp by means of manipulation for the purpose of control manifests itself in a variety of places in a variety of ways every day. It's an everyday occurrence. As I'm talking about heaven and falling from heaven and Absalom and all these cosmic things, well, you go, whoa, man, yeah, that's really wild. Let me tell you, this dynamic I am describing that began in some of those cosmic places and cosmic ways happens every day. They are everyday events in families and churches and governments and workplaces and kingdoms of every sort. Let me put it in the context of the most everyday thing that most of us know, a family. A family, a husband and a wife, and the two become one flesh. And in this little microcosm of how the world is supposed to work, a man and a woman comes together, and in their femininity and masculinity coming together is the image of God and that thing together. And from this union, they bring children into the world, and they bless them, and they nurture them and they correct them and they release them. But what if mom and dad aren't together? Suddenly, one of the parents becomes very understanding. Suddenly, one of the parents becomes very sympathetic. And the kids go to that parent, and the parent says, oh, your claims are right and good. You've been mistreated. But dad won't listen to you. Mom will never understand. They don't care about you, but if I were, your favorite parent. If I were king, if I were the one you came to, you can come to me. Here's the deal. Doesn't that look nice? Don't you feel like you're being sweet when you do? Do not wonder what spirit is involved in that. Don't wonder. At least not anymore, don't wonder. Gangs are formed like this. Your parents don't care about you. They won't listen to you. Your claims are right and good. You've been mistreated. So come over here, and we will be your friend, and we will care for you. And born of this divisive spirit that functions to usurp by means of manipulation for the purpose of control, alliances are formed. We call them gangs. And they form in places like North Minneapolis, don't they? Oh, yeah, they've got gangs in North Minneapolis. It's really bad down there, so stay away. be afraid, be very afraid. Oh, they are scary. Let me tell you, the gangs that I'm describing form in families, maybe in yours. The gangs, these alliances, born of a divisive spirit that usurp and manipulate for the purpose of control take over churches and governments and workplaces and kingdoms of every kind. And when they do, they destroy families. and churches and governments and workplaces and kingdoms of every kind. Back to the story. Pick it up in chapter 15, verse 13. It says this. Then a messenger came to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom. We've lost them, David. David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Rise and let us flee, for otherwise none of us shall escape from Absalom. Go in haste, lest he overtake us quickly. and bring calamity on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword. And the king's servants said to the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses. So the king went out, and all his household with him. Same chapter, 23rd verse says this, And while all the country was weeping with a loud voice, all the people passed over, and the king also passed over to the brook Kidron toward the way of the wilderness. And the reason I read that verse is it's very interesting, compelling to me that David started out in the wilderness. Remember when Saul was chasing him? Now his son is chasing him. He's in the same place, this wilderness place. The rebellion is successful. Chapter 16, verse 5. Then Absalom and all the people who had made alliances with him, the men of Israel, entered in Jerusalem where Absalom then began his rule. But keep in mind, the authority he is now going to move with is an illegitimate authority. He has usurped the king. He has done to David what David refused years ago to do to Saul. One of the reasons David came to the throne was because he refused to usurp even a bad king. Well, there's a... When there's a bad king, then you have a right. This story over the next few weeks is going to, in the analogy I've been living with, mess up our hair, folks. It's gonna. The kingdom is divided. The rebellion is successful. The God-ordained authority that was given to David and not to Absalom. He could have had it if it had been usurped. If this happens in a family, the family is splintered. If it happens in a church, the church is destroyed. If it happens in a kingdom, the kingdom is divided, but not for long in the story. In chapter 18, a battle ensues in which Absalom is killed. He is running for his life. One of the features of Absalom is he grew his hair long. Once a year, he would cut it. Evidently, this happened at a time when the length of his hair was at full length. He was riding under a tree. His hair got caught in a tree. Hanging by his hair from a tree, three spears were driven into his heart. Cool movie. Actually, it's kind of gross. No, man, hanging by your hair from, you know, from a tree with three spears in your heart. Not, you know, normal Sunday morning fare. But I'll tell you what, it's a picture I want you to see. I will never forget. Because I believe this is a picture of God's judgment toward. I believe it is a picture, one that we need to see, of God's attitude toward this spirit of division, this Lucifer spirit. It is the same spirit that is on Lucifer. He is the usurper. It's what he does. It is the spirit that functions to usurp authentic authority by means of manipulation behind the scenes for the purpose of illegitimate control. You don't always get to see God's attitude toward that because sometimes these dramas take a while to play out. You don't always get to see it this clear. But there it is. Never forget it. hanging by his hair from a tree with three spears in his heart. Don't wonder what God thinks about a divisive, controlling spirit. At least don't wonder about it again, because now you know. In addition to that, many of those who made alliances with Absalom, who agreed with him at the gate, who had their little grievances with David and found in Absalom an ally, Many of them fell under the same judgment that Absalom fell under. 20,000 people died in verse 7, which means, be really careful, beloved, of aligning yourself with a divisive, usurping, manipulative spirit. Be very careful. Be very nervous even about the neediness in your own heart that would quickly go to someone and say, Oh, I understand. No, the king will never hear you. Oh, yeah. Be very, very careful. Because a divisive spirit is opposed to God. A usurping spirit is the spirit of Satan. Eventually, eventually, it may take a while, but that spirit will go down, and when it does, you will go with it. Oh, Dave, this doesn't sound very graceful. Here's the deal about that. I am never more graceful as your pastor than when I am telling you the truth, and I am telling you the truth. Now, all of this raises a number of questions for me, disturbing questions. All of them are disturbing questions. The two I want to deal with quickly today are these. Number one, where was David in all of this? Number two, what does any of this have to do with the father hungry heart that you said, Dave, was what this sermon was all about at the beginning of the sermon? Well, to answer that, I need to tell you the rest of the story. I need to give you the context of the story within which Absalom's rebellion takes place. But before I do that, let me just say this about where David was in all of this. For where David was in all of this was passive. let this in where David was in all of this was disengaged uninvolved and absent creating in Absalom his son what Richard Rohr called in that quote I started the sermon with a vacuum in his soul and into that vacuum demons rushed which by the way does not mean because David had a peace in this creating this vacuum into which demons rush. That does not mean that Absalom was not responsible for his rebellion or the damage that it did. He was responsible. The Absaloms of the world are responsible for their own rebellion and pay a very high price for it, hanging from a tree by his hair with three spears in his heart. But David had a piece in this, and we can't be naive about that either. it's a peace that I believe has incredible implications for us on a number of levels not the least of which is this that as a church we have embraced and believe that we have heard from God about a part of our vision that is calling us to bless call out and release the next generation to call out and call into the fullness of their destiny the sons and the daughters in our church, in our community, to call them out. And I think this story speaks to our ability or inability. You know, you can say, well, we're going to call the next generation. Well, that sounds really good on your piece of paper. But if that's going to happen, you're going to have to deal with the passivity spirit of David. You're going to have to deal with the usurping spirit of Absalom's. see while this imagery the imagery and symbolism of the story we're going to be dealing with for the next couple of weeks comes in the context of a father-son dynamic this word I'm bringing this warning I'm bringing speaks to men and women it speaks to sons and daughters it speaks to families and churches and governments workplaces and kingdoms of every sort The story actually begins in chapter 13. So turn back to that. We started in 15. The story actually starts in 13. 2 Samuel 13, verse 1. We discover this, that Absalom, the son of David, had a beautiful sister, Tamar. And Amnon, another son of David, by another wife, loved her. But here's the deal. It wasn't love. It was lust. Verse 2. And Amnon was so frustrated sexually because of his sister Tamar that he made himself physically ill. He was obsessed with this. Frustrated because he couldn't have her. A little side note here on Amnon. Amnon was David's firstborn son. He was the heir to the throne, the crown prince. And as the crown prince, he was not used to being frustrated. As the heir apparent, he was usually getting what he wanted when he wanted it. So maybe I will take what I want. he thought. Sound familiar? It's what his father did, David, with who? Bathsheba. I will take what I want. Spirit of entitlement is all over Amnon. Got it from his dad. So he brings Tamar to himself, but Tamar didn't cooperate with this little plan, so he raped her in verse 14. And after he did, the text says he hated her. Verse 15, then Amnon hated Tamar with a very great hatred for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, get up and go away. Verse 17, then he called his young man who attended him and said, now throw this woman out of my presence and lock the door behind her. You need to understand, just lock the door behind. This is not just the Bible writer making sure we get the facts right. This is speaking of incredible, symbolic, emotional realities. The door locked behind. Kick her out. She's the bad. She has done nothing wrong. Text goes to great lengths. She was a virgin. She was pure. This was all about Amnon's sin. Then he hates her, kicks her out, closes the door, and there she is alone. Devast. Picture her. The door is behind her. She is on her own. Her life is destroyed. In this culture, she's dead. Not knowing what to do or where to go, she goes to the house of her brother, where maybe I can get some help, at least some shelter, her brother named who? Absalom. Where both of them would wait. Tamar will wait for her father to rise up and do what fathers do when daughters are devastated. Dad, I just, I can't make you. I'm not even going to tell you. She just waited. Dad, would you rise up? She waited for her father to rise up and do what fathers do and defend her and protect her and restore her honor and bring justice. And Absalom waited as well. for his father to show him how to use rightly ordered strength. The kind of rightly ordered strength that would make what is wrong right. The kind of rightly ordered strength that would fight for justice and do mercy and protect Tamar and hold Amnon accountable. Dad, show me how, because I don't know. I got all this anger. I got all this energy. I don't know where to put it. Dad, show me how. He waited for that. Absalom needed that. I'll say it this way, deserved that. How do you do it, dad? I don't know. Again, I have all this juice in me. I have all this anger in me. I don't know where to put it. The young sons, the young daughters, they don't know where to put it. Doesn't make them bad, makes them young. Richard Rohr, again in the book, The Wild Man's Journey, I quoted earlier, says this, the vast majority of young men, like Absalom, are first fascinated by and drawn into the archetype of the warrior. In youth, that's what most men want to be, a warrior. The warrior is that part of a man who has focused determination and energy. It's that I can, I will bring it on spirit that is wonderful in youth. But that energy lacks the breadth of a king. In other words, that youthful energy, while it is very good, doesn't always know where to put the energy. The warrior doesn't always know what they're supposed to be determined about. They're very determined, but they're not sure what they're supposed to be determined about. And they might get very determined about something stupid, unless they have a good king. The warrior, therefore, the warrior goes on to say, must find, be in relationship and in submission to a good king. The king here is an archetype. The warrior is an archetype. The king as well. The archetype is an archetype for wisdom or father. We need to be submissive to a good king because if the warrior isn't submissive to a good king, he'll be a loose cannon, end quote. Shooting everywhere. Does it sound like, I don't know, where we live in this culture? If he's right about that, it means this, that we need two things. Number one, good kings. who are willing to step into the realities of their own woundings and face down their own demons and come by God's grace into their own healing so they can rise up with a deeper kind of wisdom and serve as some protection for the young warriors that are coming. We need good kings. The other thing we need, if this is going to work, we would need submissive warriors who would recognize a good king and say things like this, you know, I've got all sorts of muscle, I've got all sorts of juice, but I need some wisdom as to know where to put all this juice and all this energy because I don't know, and I'm going to submit to this guy. We live in a culture. You know, I don't want to go goofy. I think our country, our country was founded on a spirit that said, I don't even want to listen to anybody. It's a spirit of rebellion. I think this is huge. It's bigger than I... It's big. you know I think of David when he was young remember the David and Goliath story I think I'm going to touch on this in weeks to come a little more because it talks to us it'll speak to us about some of David's wounds but when David was young and he was anointed to be king he knew he was going to be king Saul his king was not a good king David was determined to be a submissive warrior remember that it's one of the reasons he ascended to the throne and have the authentic anointing of God. Some of you have good kings. Some of you have good kings. You have good parental wisdom strength. But you're not a submissive warrior. You know what? You're dangerous. You're dangerous. So some of you... I lost my train of thought. I think this is big. I've made the point. I will say this. This is bigger than our church. In our church, it's bigger than our church. Can you tell that? This issue of good kings and submissive warriors is, I don't know, does it explain everything? Probably not. It sure does explain something to me. It's not good. Absalom right here needs his father to be a king. He needs his king to be a father. Show me how, Dad, because I don't know how. Chapter 13, verse 21 says this. Now, when King David heard of all these matters being the rape of Tamar, his daughter, he was very angry. Stop right there. That's a good sign, isn't it? He's filling up with the kind of energy as a father would feel for his daughter. He's going to protect her. This is good. I'm angry too. So what are we going to do, Dad? Turns out David did nothing. Verse 23 says, for two full years, David was silent, passive, uninvolved. Let me ask you a question. What do you suppose Absalom was doing for two years? Well, I know what he was doing for two years, and so do you. He was getting angrier and angrier. As he waited for justice that never came till one day, he brought the justice, and the desire for justice is a God-placed thing. He brought the justice himself. He did it himself. But he brought the justice the way a loose cannon would bring the justice. He brought the justice the way a warrior who doesn't have a king would bring the justice. He murdered Amnon, which, by the way, is what justice might have done to Amnon. Wouldn't have murdered Amnon, but in that culture, I promise you, Amnon, do you remember the law in those days? If you committed adultery, you'd get stoned. Rape, you're toast. and it would be just. The way Amnon did it, like a loose cannon without a king, it was murder. So Absalom fled, verse 34. And when he did, it says this about David, verse 37. David mourned for his son Absalom every single day. He wept, he was, I want my kid. Verse 39, and he longed to go out to him. Absalom was in exile, and David wanted to go out to him and find him and love him and bring him back, but he never did for three more years. I want to give you a picture of this spirit of passivity that's on David. You know, it's, you know, oh, David, he's so weird. Why didn't he do something? Let me tell you where the spirit of passivity, the same thing works here. It's when we come to church, and we sing the songs, and we start to get moved, and oh, I want to, and the word comes, and we go, yes, I want to follow, I want to do this, and we get moved, and we even think we have a good heart because we've responded with a tear in our eye, and we do absolutely nothing. There's your passive spirit right there. That's it. It's all over David. And with David's uninvolvement and passive response to Absalom, this critical time in his life, he is saying to Absalom essentially this, you're on your own, kid. But even in his saying to that, saying that to him, he's saying that to him without words. He never says, Absalom, you're on your own. It's just his passivity says that to him. There's no one in your corner, kid. There's no one who's got your back, kid. No one even said that to him. Absalom was just kind of left to figure that out, and he did figure it out. And that's when he took control. Spirit of control, right there. John Eldridge, in the book Wild at Heart, speaking of the father wound, says, the wounds of assault are obvious, but the passive wounds inflicted by the absent, silent, remote father are not as obvious. They are pernicious like a cancer, and because they are subtle, they often go unrecognized as wounds and are therefore much harder to heal, end quote. you know wasn't it just a couple minutes ago that Absalom was the bad guy in the story you know I mean just a couple minutes ago as I was doing this and you were feeling it and going for it everything was black and white cut and dry everything was clear and in fact as I was preaching and even writing the picture of Absalom hanging by his hair from his from a tree I'm thinking and three spears in his eye I'm going yeah well of the spirit of division. You got what you deserve. And now it's not as clear now, is it? Who the bad guy is. I need to say something again. Make no mistake, Absalom is responsible for his rebellion. And we'll pay for it dearly. But there's more going on here and we need to see it. Absalom is responsible. You know, everything I've read, most of what you have ever read about men who are in prison, there's this overwhelming father wound that brings them there. And guess what? They are paying for their rebellion. But there's a reason for it. We need to understand. Eventually in chapter 14, Joab, through a parable much like Nathan's parable that he brought to David, delivered this time by a wise woman from Tekoa in chapter 14, verse 2, persuaded David to allow Solomon to return to Jerusalem. Chapter 14, 20, Three job arose, therefore, and went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem. Imagine the trip. Coming back to the city gates, be Absalom for a moment, and wonder what he was thinking. It's been three years. What's my dad going to do? Will he be harsh? Will he be tender? Will he forgive? I don't know. The answer comes in verse 24. So the king said, let Absalom go to his own house and let him not see the face of the king. So Absalom turned to his own house and did not see the face of the king. Do you notice that it says the king and not the face of his father? I mean, all the commentaries notice this. They keep referring to David as the king and not the father. Not the father. Why? Why the king? In fact, the only time that David in this story refers to Absalom as his son, refers to Absalom even by name, is at the end when he gets news that Absalom is hanging from a tree by his hair with three spears in his heart. Then David says, Oh, Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son. And now it's too late. And he's full of regret. He did not see the face of the king for two more years. He's in Jerusalem now. And I just think, what's up with that? Honestly, when I'm doing this story and writing this out, I'm going, I don't get this. I just don't get this. At this point, Absalom's going a little crazy, like you would be and maybe are because I am telling the story that many of you have lived. Now he's in Jerusalem. His dad won't talk to him. His dad won't see him. And he's basically saying, I got to see my dad. I've got to talk to my dad. So he sends for Joab in verse 29, but Joab won't return his call. So he sends again, and Joab still won't come. So then Absalom does something that I think is pretty creative. In chapter 14, verse 30, it says, Therefore Absalom said to his servants, See, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go set it on fire. Then he'll talk to me. And it is true. Then Joab, it says in the next verse, Then Joab arose and came to Absalom at his house. Came to his house with the police. Got his attention, didn't he? You've never seen that before, have you? Holy moly. Can you say holy moly here? Yeah. Yeah, he's laughing because he's going, holy moly ain't nothing. Anyway. I know how you talk. set your fields on fire. Kids will do that. Kids will do that, you know. See, they'd really like your loving attention and your willing involvement, but if they can't get it, they'll set your fields on fire. They'll flunk out of school when they are very bright. They'll get involved with drugs. They'll get arrested on Saturday night. They'll get their girlfriend pregnant. And I'm not saying everybody who does that is doing it for these reasons, but I'm telling you, there are some huge connections here. well joab finally goes to king king david and says you got to see this kid verse 33 so joab went and to the king and told him and david finally did call for absalom face to face thus he that is absalom came to the king and prostrated himself that means he bowed down to him on his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed absalom and on the surface it looks like reconciliation doesn't it oh they're kissing you need to understand do you have every commentary once again indicated, do you see that he calls him, he's still the king, he's not the dad. See, this prostrating yourself, anybody would do that coming into the presence of the king who's been in exile. I'm not sure I'm going to live or die. So you bow down to the king. It's like David's still functioning like a CEO, not a dad. And then David lifts him up and kisses him. He would do that to anybody. It's like saying, I'm going to let you live. So on the surface, it looks like reconciliation. There is no reconciliation. Two verses later, we read this. Then Absalom used to rise up early and stand beside the way of the gates, saying, your claims are right and good. The king doesn't care about you. He doesn't love you. He won't hear you. And the rebellion is underway. And by this time in the story, I'm pretty sure that even if David had authentically repented, it would be too late. The rebellion is going to happen. Because into the vacuum of Absalom's soul, created by what Richard Rohr calls father hunger, demons had rushed. Demons of fear, mistrust, cynicism, and rage. One final question. how do you suppose we wrap this sermon up maybe by first telling you that I can't wrap this sermon up not today I do not have any pretty little ribbons and I do not have any fancy little bows to tie this up in a nice little package and say now go it's wonderful we need to spend some time on this we need to unpack this much like we did when we got into the story of David and Bathsheba this story, I haven't even told all the elements of it yet it stirs up lots of questions most of them are disturbing questions like what's up with David's passivity why does he shut down like this where did that passivity come from was he always like that was he passive in certain areas of his life but not passive in others and if he was, why? And what's up with this pattern among men, quite frankly, of violence on one hand, as we see embodied in Absalom, and passivity on the other hand, as we see embodied in David, and you may not have ever put it together quite that way, but passive men and violent men, it's where we live. Where do you see violent men? Where do you see violence in men? Read the paper, pick a page. violence in men, passivity in men, disengaged, uninvolved, leave their family. We are getting into something. I want to say this. People who pray, you need to pray as we go into this, because we need healing here. We need spirits cast out here. We're in over our head. God help us. But we're going here. Bigger question than all the questions we're going to mess around with over the next couple of weeks might be this. Is there hope? I mean, if David couldn't get it right, how am I going to get it right? Is there healing for this? If you're an Absalom or if you're David, stuck in passivity, men who are stuck in passivity hate it. Is there healing? Is there hope? I think the answer is yes. And Jesus gave us just a hint as to where that hope and healing might be found when he taught us how to pray, when he said, pray this way our what? Father. Oh, by the way, the one who is in heaven. God is calling forth kings, okay? God is calling forth fathers, men and women, who will step into the deep places of the wisdom to call out the next generation. But I don't care how much we step into the fullness of our destiny as fathers and mothers and wise people calling out the next generation. We are not the father. We have one father. We are not the king. We have one king. And that is our hope. And we have to unpack that as well over the next couple of weeks. Maybe the best place to start and most honest place to start might be to acknowledge that in some way we are all like Absalom and we are all like David. We are all victims of sin. We are all perpetrators of sin. We all have rebellion in us. We all have passivity in us. So maybe the best way to respond today to the weight of this is just to say, God, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. We need your help. We need your heart. We need your healing. And in order for us to corporately even enter into that desire for mercy and help, I've asked Joel to come and lead us in a song and sing it if you can. You can listen to it if you want, but I want you to stand just as we're doing this together and close with this. King, Father eternal Have mercy on us Fount of light Creator of all Have mercy on us The Lord who offers amazing grace Have mercy on us Breath of the Father, Spirit and Son Have mercy on us Lord, hear my cry for mercy For only you can help me Lord, take my sin and cleanse me As I reach out in my hands to you Christ, true God and true men Have mercy on us Christ, bright and rising sun Have mercy on us You are the Lord who purges our sin Have mercy on us Consoler of the sorrowing soul Have mercy on us Lord, hear my cry for mercy For only you can help me Lord, take my sin and cleanse me As I reach out in my hands to you Lord, hear my cry for mercy for only you can help me. Lord, take my sin and cleanse me as I reach out in my hands to you. We pray for mercy. We pray for grace. We acknowledge that in all of us is the spirit of Absalom, is the spirit of David. I pray that in the acknowledgement of that we would not fall into despair, but something in us would begin to rise. As we do indeed reach out to you, our Father, for the healing that we need to bring life to generations who need to know how to live and love and walk and give the life of your kingdom to others. Raise up kings, raise up warriors, raise up young men and women, wise men and women who can move in the fullness of your kingdom out of our healing, into our strength. I pray these things in Jesus' name be true and growing among us and all God's people said in agreement, it's what we want. Amen. Amen. You are dismissed. God bless you. Go in peace. you
