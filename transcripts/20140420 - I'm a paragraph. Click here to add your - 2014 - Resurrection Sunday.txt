Remember Christ, who, although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a bondservant and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. For this reason also, God highly exalted him and bestowed upon him the name, which is above every name so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. This is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. I love preaching on Easter. You have no idea. Because while people argue about what actually happened and how it happened and even whether it happened, 2,000 years ago, something happened. Something that had never happened before in the course of human history when a few brokenhearted people went to the tomb of a man that they loved to pay their respects, maybe to deal one more time with their grief, but were told when they arrived that the tomb where their friend had been laid was empty now because something had happened. It was pretty confusing on the front end. They weren't sure what, but something had happened, and it turns out it was something so significant and so much more important than anything else that had ever happened before this or since this, that all of human history, actually, is divided into two parts. Don't think about this very often. The first being everything that happened B.C., before what? Christ. And everything that happened A.D., after what? Death. But that's when it got crazy, because it was after his death that something happened. And the something that happened changed everything. It was the Christ. They called him Jesus Christ, born more than 20 centuries ago to an impoverished young couple in an obscure little village in an insignificant little corner of the world that no one had heard of before. Maybe a few hundred people actually ever met him. A few thousand people actually ever heard him. He never traveled outside his region. He never wrote a book. He never held an office. He never led an army. He never governed a nation. He didn't even have his own home. The Romans didn't consider him significant enough, at least at the time, to even record his execution so far as we know. And yet, over the last 2,000 years, this one man, whose name we know as Jesus, would inspire the founding of more universities, the creation of more hospitals, the launching of more charities, the writing of more books, expression of more great art than any other name under heaven ever. Indeed, the power of that one name would eventually move more people to sacrifice their finances, their possessions, their safety, their careers, sometimes even their lives, and any other name under heaven ever. Even the instrument of death upon which his body was broken, the Roman cross that in the day symbolized nothing but suffering and death and fear, stirring up nothing in the hearts of men and women and children to nothing but terror and fear has since become the most recognizable symbol in the world, stirring now in the hearts of men and women and children to not suffering, death, and fear, but worship, and gratitude, and love, and hope. And all of that is because 2,000 years ago, something happened. And the something that happened changed everything, particularly for a few broken-hearted people. Two women were the first, actually, to get there, who'd gone to the tomb of this man that they had loved to pay their respects, to maybe deal with their grief. But when they arrived, something had happened, and it changed everything, including them. A ragtag group, were they? These followers of Jesus, you know it's true ordinary at best, some of them fishermen and the like, undesirable, actually. At worst, some of them were publicans and prostitutes. They were drunkards and sinners, a skittish group. Were they fearful too? Dull of hearing. Even when Jesus was there, they didn't quite get it. None of them, quite frankly, possessed the kind of pedigree or capacity, morally or intellectually, that you would want to be looking for if you were thinking about or looking to start a movement of any kind, certainly one that would change the world. Indeed, when Jesus needed them the most, they were often at their worst, because at crunch time, when the heat really got turned up, Judas betrayed him. Peter denied him. All of them left him and fled like frightened little sheep, just like he said they would. They did. But then something happened, And the something that happened changed everyone and everything, including this ragtag, weak-kneed, skittish group of followers, because whatever it was that happened, if something happened, it changed them. It changed their despair into hope, their fear into faith, their cowardice into courage. Peter would be a prime example of this change, maybe exhibit A, so full of fear, was Peter that day. You remember that day, that crucifixion day. A servant girl, a servant girl confronted him. You knew him, didn't you? I never knew him. I swear to God I didn't know him three times. He swore three times. He denied. But then something happened. And the something that happened changed everything, including Peter, the guy who was scared in front of a servant girl, because actually just a few weeks later in Acts chapter 2, the same Peter standing before a hostile crowd in the middle of Jerusalem took his stand to say these words beginning in verse 22 of Acts chapter 2. Men of Israel, listen to me. Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know this man was delivered up by predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God and then nailed to the cross by the hands of sinful men and by that was put to death. But then something happened. That was his sermon, something that had never happened before, something so significant and so important that it changed everything because God, says Peter in verse 24, raised him up again, putting an end to the agony of his death since it was impossible for him to be held by death's power. Therefore, says Peter, the guy who was timid in front of a servant girl, says this, let all of Israel know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus who was crucified because God raised him up again. And when he did raise him up again, he gave to him the name. And now I'm quoting Paul in Philippians chapter 2 from the text Vicki read. But here's a guy who went through a change as well. His name used to be Saul. He hated this name, ravaging the churches. But something changed, and all of a sudden he's talking about the name. Indeed, he gave to him, that is, Jesus, the name. which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, of those in heaven and on the earth and under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of the Father. And that is the something that changed everything, including a guy like Peter and a guy like Saul, who became Paul in this ragtag group of followers 2,000 years ago because it changed their despair into hope, their fear into faith, their cowardliness into courage, but it raises a question. In the context of all this rah, rah, rah, he rose stuff, there is a question. The question is this, why? Seriously, why does the resurrection of Christ change everything? Make it more personal. Why did it change Peter? Why did it change Saul, who became Paul. Let's talk about Paul. The apostle Paul. 1 Corinthians 15, he's finding himself there in a fight. Now, 1 Corinthians 15, for those, many of you know, this is kind of this treatise on the resurrection of Christ and this powerful exposition of the history of that event. But actually, what's going on in 1 Corinthians 15 is he's in a fight. And I like knowing that because it makes it a little more interesting to read for me. He's in a fight with some people in Corinth who were doing two things, both of them designed to undermine Paul's authority and the authority, actually, of the gospel. They were trying on one hand to question Paul's motives for doing what he was doing, that he actually was kind of a show-off and looking for attention, maybe for a following, for people to kind of come around him and he could have a crowd. And they were wanting to undermine him because he actually wanted the people, these people wanted the people in Corinth to follow them. And the second thing they were doing was undermining confidence in the resurrection and they were doing this in the context of claiming themselves to be intellectually superior. They were actually a group of people, kind of an off-branch of the Sadducees who saw themselves as the intellectually elite in Corinth and therefore above the fray of the common person too intelligent. They thought themselves to believe in such nonsense as rising from the dead which clearly implies that those who do believe that people can rise from the dead, that Jesus rose from the dead aren't very smart. Indeed, look at who does believe this nonsense. Would they say they're idiots? Hayseeds from Galilee are his followers, fishermen. You kidding? Publicans and prostitutes, seriously. Who would seriously take them seriously? But Paul was none of that, and that's part of what makes this interesting, because Paul was not a hayseed from Galilee. They couldn't put him in this category. Indeed, before Paul came to faith, you know his name was Saul. He was widely known as a brilliant scholar, an accomplished Pharisee, the student of Gamaliel, who was one of the most famous rabbis of the day from the city of Tarsus. Tarsus, which was known most for its university. Indeed, in the day, there was Athens, Alexandria, and Tarsus. It would be like Princeton, Harvard, and Yale is what that was like. So when Paul responds to these people in Corinth who'd infiltrated the church there with their arrogant attitude, we're the intelligent ones, and we're just above the fray of you common people, and their poisonous views, he's more than a little angry. There's a protective thing in him. It's kind of feisty what's coming along here. He's actually getting in their face, first century version of trash talking here. I really like that. Helps me read the Bible. Anyway, we went in verse 32, 1 Corinthians 15. He asked them this question, and there's an edge on this question. He says this, why do you think I do what I do? Why do you think I do it? Well, and as we're thinking here, I know you're the thinkers here. Why do you think I fought wild beasts in Ephesus? He says in verse 32, why do you think I allowed myself to be in danger every hour? He says in verse 30. You think I like it. You think it's fun. You think I'm showing off. Okay. Verse 31, I protest, brethren. By the way, you see it. I protest. He didn't say it like that. I know it's just written, I protest, brethren, verse 31, by the arrogance I see in you toward me. I'm not happy with this because the truth about this is I die every day. If you see it in that verse, and that sounds real spiritual, what he means is this, I give it away every day. I pour out what God has given me to give every day. I die every day. So think about it. As long as you're thinkers. I know you're the smart ones. If from human motives, look at verse 32. If from human motives I fought wild beasts at Ephesus. Let me break that down. In other words, if I do the things I do, which sometimes means fighting wild beasts at Ephesus, but always it means pouring it out and continuing to care and dying every day and giving it away again. If I live that way from human motives. And a human motive would be to get attention. If I do this to get a crowd, to make a name for myself, to somehow get famous, at the end of the verse is this question to them, what would profit me? What good would that do me seriously? Because the truth about me is this, says Paul, if Christ is not raised and dead men don't rise, I would never do any of that. Fight wild beasts? For what? Because it draws a crowd. I don't care about the crowd. I would never pour it out. I would never really care. I would never take a chance. I would never say, I'm sorry. I never promise, especially to you. I would never love another. I would never give away. I would ever play it safe. Indeed, if Christ is not raised, then here's my advice. In fact, I would change my whole message. Verse 32, if Christ is not raised, here's my message. Eat and drink. Live for today. Tomorrow you die. And when you die, you're done. Better grab it now when you can. Because this life is all there is to life. But now, see, I saw something, and I know something that I can't unsee and can't unknow. Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who sleep, and that is the something that changes everything. And that is why. It's the only why. I would fight wild beasts in Ephesus. I'm not trying to get a crowd. I'm not trying to get famous. Don't care. That is why I pour it out, and that is why I keep on caring and keep on giving, and that is why I stick around, and that is why I say I'm sorry. And that is why I love another, and that is why it's worth it all, because something happened that changed everything and everyone, including a guy like Peter, who denied him, and Thomas, who doubted him, and Paul who persecuted him, a ragtag group of followers 2,000 years ago, whose despair was turned to hope, whose fear was turned to faith, whose cowardice was turned to courage, because what they saw when they were finally able to see, because they didn't all see, at least not at first, think about that, a little piece of the story when Mary and Mary, remember this? They came to the tomb. It was opened. And then Mary starts talking to who she thought was the gardener. And it wasn't the gardener. It was the resurrected Christ. And then her eyes were opened. And then she saw, but she didn't see right away, just like you don't always see. And just like I don't always see. And then those two disciples on the road to Emmaus, they were talking to the resurrected Christ. And they're saying to Christ, are you the only one in all of Israel who doesn't know about what happened in Jerusalem? He's the one, whatever. They couldn't see. They couldn't see. And then their eyes were opened. And then they saw. And what they saw changed everything. Just like you and just like me, we don't always see. Even now it's hard to see. But when they were finally able to see, what they saw provided for them two things. That were secured forever in their minds and in their hearts by the resurrection of Christ. The first was this, the promise of future hope. But more the promise of present life. The future hope was this, that because he lives, so will I. And when they saw the resurrected with the physical eyes, with the eyes of their spirit, the eyes of their heart, they were able to see the reality of that. They knew that his resurrection was just the first fruits of many to follow. Those are Paul's words. But my favorite picture of this is actually found in Acts chapter 5, verse 31. We've spoken of this before, but it fits here really well. Again, Peter, picture him, the denier before the servant girl, just a few weeks later, is standing before the council, the same council that rendered the verdict on Jesus to have him crucified. And they want Peter dead as well. And what they're troubled with is what Peter is saying about Jesus. So renounce all the stuff about Jesus. Instead, Peter says this in verse 31, describing Jesus as the one whom God exalted to his right hand. He is our prince and savior. And so what Peter is saying in effect is this, so you can kill me. I don't care. If you want, you can do that. But here's the deal. Jesus is the one whom God exalted at his right hand, and he is now my prince. Prince. That's the word I want to unpack here quick. It means trailblazer, forerunner, waymaker on a ship. They would have someone often called an archagos, a trailblazer, forerunner, waymaker. when the ship was in a place where it was incapable of coming to the shore without being dashed on the rocks, they would tie a rope, literally, around one of the crewmen. And he would usually be the best swimmer. He was their archegos, their trailblazer, their way maker to the shore. And with this rope tied around his neck and still fastened to the ship, he would dive in alone into these waters of death for anybody else. And if he made it through those waters to the shore on the other side alive, everyone on board would begin to cheer. He made it. But the cheering, and this is significant, wasn't just because he made it. Like you and I might cheer for someone scoring the touchdown at the end of the game. He won. We win. It's up. Now, there was more going on than that because when he got to shore, he'd take the rope from around his waist, untie it, then tie it to a tree or to a rock, turning then to the crew, effectively saying to the rest of the crew, here's the deal. Here's what my making it means. It means this, that because I made it, you will too grab the rope, your home picture. Now Peter, the denier, before the servant girl, standing now before the council, who want him dead, and they can do it, but this time Peter stands and says, I don't care. Take your best shot. you can do what you want because I got me a prince and a savior my prince dove head first into the waters of death waters that if I or you ever dove into by ourselves we would never be able to come out alive but he dove head first and he did it for joy for the joy set before him he endured the cross. He dove head first into these waters, which means he humbled himself, becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross, a cross, where according to the book of Hebrews, he tasted death for every man, and when he died, the book of Ephesians says he descended. Remember this? Into the lower parts of the earth, but Ephesians 4 verse 10 says the one who descended is also the one who ascended, resurrection, far above all the heavens. And when he did ascend, having descended, when he ascended, he made a proclamation, says Peter in 1 Peter 3. The proclamation was this. It's kind of an Easter staple around here. What you meant for evil, he's saying this to Satan and all the demons of hell. What you thought was your greatest victory is actually your biggest defeat. What you meant for evil, God meant for good. I win, you lose. Bye-bye. And he blew open the gates of hell, led captive. A host of captives gave gifts to men. Amen. And then Peter says, that's what I mean when I say I got me a prince. Dove into the waters of death with a rope around his waist, as it were, went right through the water, came out the other side alive, turned around, and proclaimed as he did that because I live, so will you, because I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. Just grab a rope, your home, and that is the something that changed everything for Peter and for Saul, who became Paul and Mary and Martha and that ragtag group of followers 2,000 years ago because when they saw the resurrected one, what they saw secured in their minds and their hearts forever two things, one future hope, which made them fearless when they faced death. Well, actually not fearless. It made them unwavering because they were afraid. When you die, you could be afraid. But their spirit now was this, death can hurt me. Death can scare me. What I know now is it'll never keep me. Because he rose, so will I. Second thing was this, present life. It wasn't just heaven when you die. When they saw the resurrected one, it was more than that. Ephesians 2 verse 1 says this, that we were dead, all of us, in our sin. which means it's worse than we thought. We're not just sinners who need forgiveness. We are sinners who need forgiveness, but it's worse than that. It says we were dead people spiritually. What you needed wasn't just forgiveness. You needed life. You needed a resurrection of sorts. So God, it says in Ephesians 4, 2, 4, being rich in mercy because of the great love with which He loved us even when we were dead in our transgressions and in our sins, God made us alive. He didn't to just forgive us. He resurrected us spiritually together with Christ, which is not just future hope of heaven when you died, speaking of present life and eternal kind of life right here, right now, which is really good news. Because sometimes, like the prophet Ezekiel, remember that scripture that Vicki read at the very beginning of the service, looking out on the valley. In Ezekiel, he was looking out a valley that kind of was symbolic of the nation. Sometimes we can look at the church. You could look over the valley of my life or yours. Sometimes looking out over the valley of my life, all I can see is bones. And they're very dry, which means not only are there dead places in my life or yours, but they've been dead for a very long time. And so you wonder, like Ezekiel, Can these bones live? Can these dead places in me ever come to life? And so the Spirit of the Lord said to Ezekiel, prophesy, I want you to speak to the bones, and when you do, I will cause breath to come into you, verse 5, and you will come to life, and then you will see. Then you will know, verse 13, that I am the Lord your God when I have opened your graves, brought those dead places to life, caused you to come out of your graves, and you will be my people, and I will put my spirit within you, and you will come to life. Indeed, more and more and more you will come to life. So, beloved, the message of Easter, and the gospel that we preach is this, springing forth from that which is dead life can come. What we refer to around here is an eternal kind of life that isn't just heaven when you die. It's right here right now being made alive, more and more and more alive. And it's yours for the asking. Because you can't achieve it. You can only receive it. But you need to believe it to somehow see it. And so we pray, Lord, help us see you. Amen. you
