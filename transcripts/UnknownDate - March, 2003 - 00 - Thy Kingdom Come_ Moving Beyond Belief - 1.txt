Let's pray together as we move to the ministry of the Word. Father, I'm asking for the same thing I've been asking for, we've been asking for for weeks. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, right here, right now, by the power of your Spirit through this Word. We ask that this be done in Jesus' name. Amen. A couple of weeks ago, in the context of our ongoing study of the Thy Kingdom Come portion of the Lord's Prayer, we noted that a good number of Christians these days are engaging in what I referred to as Star Trek praying. Where they basically pray this way, Lord, get us out of here so we can go up there and be with you. In other words, just beam us up, Scotty. The thinking behind that kind of praying goes something like this. The world is in an awful mess and getting messier every day. But we're going to heaven when we die. And since we couldn't possibly make a difference in the way the world is going, we will pine for heaven and wait for the rapture when we will be ejected from this place and Jesus will return to torch what's left. And so we pray, Lord, get us out of here so we can go up there and be with you. But what we've been discovering in the last several weeks, among other things, is this, that there's a very serious problem with praying that way. Chief among them is this, that Jesus never, ever taught us to pray that way. In fact, quite the opposite. He said, when you pray, pray instead this way. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven, which means, among other things, that our prayer is not to be, Lord, get us out of here so we can go up there and be with you, but rather, Lord, help us to become the kind of people who, even though it is dark and getting darker, help us become the kind of people who are bringing down here on earth what is going on up there in heaven. For God has been and continues to be looking for and calling out a people who are alive to God and to his reign and rule, his kingdom in such a way that they will become partners with him in bringing what's going on up there down here. Because here's the deal, regardless of how dark and scary things in this world really do get, and they really are right now dark and scary, God has not given up on this earth. the kingdom of God is still breaking through and God is still looking for and desiring to partner with kingdom bringers men and women young and old rich and poor every possible ethnicity every possible shape and size who are willing to follow him into the adventure of a lifetime into the workings of God on earth in this generation right here and right now where dead men and women are coming alive to God, where people are beginning to exchange their plant-like existence for life in the kingdom of God, where lame men and women are beginning to walk, where rich men and women are beginning to share what they have with the poor, and where powerful men and women are beginning to see that the best possible way they can use their power is to pick up a basin and a towel and to serve those who are weak. In other words, when the kingdom of God comes to earth, it makes a real difference in the real world. And so we pray, thy kingdom come. Right here, right now. Now, here at Open Door, we are taking the charge to become kingdom bringers just as seriously as we know how to take it. And it's why today and for actually the next couple of weeks, we want to talk about right in the middle of our series on the kingdom of God, how it is that we as a church specifically plan to, in practical, tangible, and visible ways, actually implement what we are calling kingdom initiatives that can give legs to what in a sermon may be stirring and lofty, but still leaves us wondering, well, that was a good sermon, but how do you actually accomplish that? What kinds of things are we actually going to do, the operative word there being, do? The fact is, in what we may rightly call today a state of the church address, I want to acknowledge and introduce to you a statement of ministry focus and direction that we think embodies what God is saying to us as a church these days, where God is calling us to as a church these days. The statement may best be referred to as the theme. I suppose the theme for this season in our church's life, you saw it on the screen when you came in this morning, you saw it on the screen when we just participated in the offertory. The theme is this, Thy kingdom come, moving beyond belief. Because we believe. That it's one thing to pray, Thy kingdom come, and to believe that that's an important thing to do and that things might happen when you pray that way, but it is quite another to move beyond what we believe in our heads to where we actually begin to act, to where we actually begin to do things that are consistent with the kingdom values and virtues that we say we believe. For it is, beloved, in the actual doing that we begin to see the supernatural inbreaking of God's kingdom in our ordinary lives in ways that really are beyond belief. I don't know if you can tell, but I really like that phrase, beyond belief, moving beyond belief, as the expression of our ministry focus and direction these days. I hope you like it too, because you're going to hear it a lot, and you're going to see it a lot. As I said, it was on the screen. It's going to appear on a lot of literature that we are passing out and trying to use to capture your imagination. And I hope it does do that. I hope it captures your imagination. What does it mean to move beyond belief? See, I simply think it speaks to the fact that as we become more and more a people who are indeed moving beyond what we say we believe into action, into doing, that it is then we will see the workings of God among us that are in fact beyond belief. Things that maybe we have never seen before. Empowering us not only to be a people who are experiencing the kingdom of God, but empowering us to be a people who are bringing the kingdom of God right here, right now. But here's the million dollar question around all this energy. How do you do that? How do we do that? How do we specifically as a church, There's certain ways that as individuals we respond at our own personal level. But how do you literally mobilize a church to move beyond belief as a people? What's the plan? Well, I need more than one week to tell you that. I usually need more than one week to tell you anything. So let me start with this, this week. The philosophical theological foundation, the underpinnings, if you will, on which our plan is built, from which our plan to move beyond belief will flow. I want you to know what drives this, because that makes all the difference in my mind. The risk of oversimplifying, there are two things, two pillars on which this thing is built, to aspects of truth from which all of this activity will flow, to things that we are absolutely committed to, that our plan is driven by this belief, that if we are a church that is not providing, that if we are not providing ways for people to enter into and authentically experience the transformation of their heart, their character, their everyday lives, more and more into the likeness of Christ. If we are not providing experiences for you that make a difference in how you love people and how you treat your husband or your wife or your children or your parents or your neighbors, we may be putting on a good show on the weekends and we may be drawing a big crowd, but we are not accomplishing anything of substantial eternal kingdom value. Therefore, foundational underpinning number one is this, that it is, we believe, our responsibility to provide not only an environment, but mechanisms of training and support whereby authentic transformation can take place in your life and in my life. Key word here, if you're looking for one word to hang all of this on, is this, transformation. Transformation. Religious entertainment so that people fill the seats on Saturday night and Sunday morning is absolutely not our concern or aim as a church. A few weeks ago, I bumped into an acquaintance of mine that I see from time to time at the athletic club where I work out. He's a guy who goes to another church. He's a really good guy, and he knows about Open Door, and he knows that I'm the pastor at Open Door. And so when we talk, we talk about church a little bit. He asks me questions. And on this particular occasion, he asked me how things were going with the new building and the move, what's going on. As I tried to answer his question, I could tell that my answers were not satisfying him. What I was saying wasn't what he wanted to know. I know that because he finally said, that's not what I want to know. So I was able to kind of, whoa, okay. What I want to know is how many new people have begun to go to Open Door since you moved in September? because to him and a lot of people, and it doesn't make him a bad person, but to him and a lot of people like him, how many new people we have had at Open Door since September answers the question how things are going. I mean, I really don't need to know anything else. If I know what the numbers are, then I know how things are going at Open Door. The assumption is this. If the numbers are up things are going well. If the numbers are down, things are not going so well. So I told him, and this is just because he wanted to know the answer to the question. I told him, well, in the five months we've been there, we've increased 50%. Big smile he had. Because now he knew how we were doing. And because I don't think that's necessarily the measure of how we're doing, I kind of felt this edgy thing rise up in me. And you know how well I hide my emotions, so I don't know if he saw that or not. But I just, I could feel this edgy thing when I said these words, but I don't really care about the numbers. I don't really care about the numbers, which is, by the way, a big fat lie. Yes, I do. If nobody showed up next week, I'd... I don't care about the numbers, you know? You know, saying you don't care about the numbers when your church has just grown by 50% in five months. It's like some millionaire who lives on Lake Minnetonka saying, I really don't care about the money. It's the work. You know, it's like, you know, if you don't care, you really don't care about the money, okay, fine. Give it to me, give it to me. You liar. You know, anyway. Here's the deal. I care, we care that people show up I'm excited when they do I'd be discouraged if they didn't numbers, this is the truth numbers mean something if this place were in fact empty next week it wouldn't mean something if I showed up next week and no one was here it wouldn't mean something hopefully it wouldn't mean I'm here on the wrong day but it would mean If next week all three services were packed to the gills, there wasn't a place to sit. That would mean something. Here's the rub, however, folks. I don't always know what that means. See, we've grown 50% in five months. What does that mean? Why have we grown 50% in five months? Is it because there's a great move of God in Maple Grove? Is that why? Well, yes. Well, no. Maybe. I don't know. Is it because we've got a new building and people are curious? Well, yes. No. Maybe. I don't know. Is it because people are hungry for God and they find it here? yes no maybe I don't know is it because people want religious entertainment and they find that here laughter laughter evidently laughter you just ruined my point laughing laughter That was supposed to have a big edge to it. You know I'm driving that, don't you? I don't know what the numbers mean. Here's what I do know. I do know this. That while the numbers mean, they mean something. The numbers matter. Here's the deal, beloved. They cannot be, they cannot be the measure. They cannot be the goal. See, just because the numbers are up does not necessarily mean we are doing a kingdom thing. Now, I think we're doing a kingdom thing, but the measure of that is not, cannot be the numbers. A number of our staff went to a conference last week in San Diego, came back with a report, and we were talking about all sorts of things. It was all over the map. It was very energetic and very exciting. And one of the things back was, you know, and it was talking about the church is losing some grip and ground in terms of its effectiveness in the culture. The number one growing religion in the Western world right now is Buddhism. Well, they got the numbers. Well, that doesn't mean they're doing a kingdom thing. And just because the numbers would go down does not necessarily mean you're not doing a kingdom thing. We need to look for a different measure. We need to be shooting for a different goal. Numbers do mean something, but we better be careful what we decide they mean. Now, it's not just me, but we. We have a lot of energy around this issue. And for you to understand why we do, I need to tell some story. I need to share some things that involve our journey, kind of the story of God among us. And if you're new, this would be, I think, very helpful for you to know who we are. If you've been with us for a long, long time and on this journey, some of these stories you've heard before. But hearing the story of God over and over, especially as it relates to how the story of God has been unfolding among us, is a thing we need to hear over and over again. Tell me the story. It was about six years ago that, as it relates to my own personal journey, I got a picture, what some might call a vision or a word, relative to what the second half of my ministry was to be about. The picture was this, that in the first half of my ministry life, I had kind of been the leader of a parade, kind of a Pied Piper is the picture I had in this picture I got, who was blowing the trumpet of amazing grace as loudly and as clearly as I knew how to do to an ever-increasing crowd of people, numbering, we thought, around 5,000 people. I mean, we kind of thought, how many people? well, I think we're around 5,000 people. How did you know this? It's really interesting to kind of contrast how we determined what our number was many, many years ago. And see, now we'd have this crazy thing of actually counting. It's very discouraging, by the way, to actually know. I have a tendency of looking like if you were to ask me how many are here today, I would say this. It's packed. This place is packed. And then they count. In those days, some janitor, I think, came up to us in Robbinsdale one day and said, well, I don't know for sure, but I think, you know, if that gym is full. It's like 2,000 people. Okay. And then we would have a service and it would look full and we'd go, there must have been 2,000 people times. We have a church of 6,000. We had no idea how many we had. Here's the deal. We had a lot. It was big. We really didn't know who they were. We really didn't know why they were there. But bigger is better. And it was good. And it was even God. But in this picture I got about six years ago, it was very clear to me, and this picture wasn't just mine, it became ours. It was very clear that the second half of my ministry life, of our open doors ministry life, was to be different than the first in this way, That instead of leading a parade to an ever-increasing crowd, we were, not just me, but we were to stop, turn around, and call out the life of God in people to what may be a smaller, a much smaller crowd. Now, six years ago, six, a much smaller, that's a very difficult, there's a hairball in my throat on that one. I don't like swallowing that one. Well, it did get smaller. If you've been on the journey with us, you've known that it got smaller. Some of it even had to do with physical things. I mean, when we got pressed out of Robbinsdale High School, we went to Earl Brown. Wasn't it fun at Earl Brown? I don't know how many we have. It's packed. We must have thousands. It was a much smaller room. It was packed. But we went significantly down in numbers when we went to Earl Brown. Standing room only. Significantly fewer people. We moved from Robbinsdale on Saturday night gym to the Crystal Building. We couldn't fit anybody in that crazy place, Crystal Building. Well, we filled a few people. The truth is we talked about the possibility that the Saturday night service was dead. We were wondering what it was going to be an experiment to even have the Saturday night service because the size that we had in terms of the building we could meet in was so much smaller. During that season of our church's life, there were a lot of people that I trust in the prophetic realm who were coming to us with words, and it helped us. It helped me through that season where God was speaking to us some very serious words about Gideon, about a smaller group of people who were going to have a much clearer idea of why it is we are here in preparation for a new moving of God's Spirit among us that we would not see until we went through this season. And some of you who are on the journey with us know exactly what I'm talking about. You remember these things, I'm sure, very well. It was during that season of our church's life, about six years ago, that we began to talk in earnest about things like transformation. It's kind of the first time we began to hear those kinds of words, spiritual formation, and how does that happen? Paul's passion in Galatians 4, till Christ be formed in you, became our mantra for ministry and the focus of our vision. We found ourselves drawn to voices of people like Leanne Payne and Dallas Willard, and then of late, people like John Ortberg and N.T. Wright. Men and women who I believe are pioneers in this movement of the Spirit of God in the church, particularly in the American church of authentic transformation and how it actually happens in people's life, how people actually begin to become different kind of people, a more loving kind of person. Because all too often, authentic transformation doesn't seem to happen. Have you noticed that? Yeah, you have, and we talk about it here all the time. Christians who in the actual living of their actual lives and arenas of life, kind of important like love and joy and peace, kind of important like relationships and how you treat your wife and your husband and how you treat your kids and how you treat your parents and how you handle your money. kind of important, things like character and compassion. We discovered an awful lot of Christians in those pretty important arenas of life who are not a whole lot different than unbelievers. But hey, we're all going to heaven when we die because we said the magic words, we prayed the magic prayer. Let's just wait for the rapture now. See, part of why we at Open Door have the energy around this issue that we do. Part of why this issue of transformation has so taken root and become so central to the ministry focus here is because the seeds of it were planted in the soil of our own personal disillusionment around what the ministry of Church of the Open Door itself was actually producing in the lives of people, particularly what it was producing in the crowd of people. Thus, The ambivalence around how big, how big. To say how big doesn't matter isn't true. To say that's the measure, it isn't true. Dallas Willard in his book Divine Conspiracy makes it clear that this is not just an open door problem. It's not like open door has some unique, awful disease. Well, that's a church problem. Quoting a recent Gallup poll, he says this. In fact, it's a fairly uniquely American church problem. Here's what he quotes. 94% of all Americans believe in God. 74% claim to have made a personal commitment to Jesus Christ. And about 34% confess to a new birth experience. These figures are shocking, says Willard, when thoughtfully compared to statistics on that same group of people for unethical behavior, crime, mental disorder, family failure, addictions, financial misleadings and the like. Could such a combination of profession of faith and failure in life really be the life and life abundantly that Jesus came to give? Or have we somehow developed an understanding of commitment to Christ that does not break through into the living, transforming power and presence of Christ in our lives? Without question, says Willard, it is the latter that has occurred and with devastating consequences in the church, end quote. Then Willard challenges people like me, pastors of churches, and churches like ours with this question. And this is like an irritating question, but it's an incredibly important question. He says this, is this failure in the church to bring authentic life-giving change to people's real lives happening in spite of what we are teaching and focusing on? In other words, the teaching is great. If we would just do it. Or is the failure of the church to bring authentic life-giving change to people's real lives precisely because of what we're teaching and focusing on? Meaning that maybe there's something radically wrong with our understanding of the gospel Jesus came to preach with what it even means to be a kingdom person so he set the bar really low. Here's the deal. Pray the prayer. Sign the card. Now you're done. One of the things I hear on a fairly regular basis, primarily because of the circles I run in with pastors and people who are just trying to figure out how to do church and stuff like that, is this, that the kind of transformation I'm talking about this morning and that we talk about here at Open Door, I think on a fairly regular basis, that that kind of transformation cannot actually happen at a church-wide level in a megachurch. In fact, there are some significant movements right now in the culture that say big is bad and small is good because it just can't happen, well-intended you might be, it just can't happen in what's called a megachurch. And if megachurch is big, we're one of those. Why can't it happen? Well, one of the things that's absolutely necessary, transformation, authentic transformation, does not happen outside community. And it's very hard sometimes for large churches. Have we experienced that? Oh, boy, we sure have. There's also an assumption that if it's big, it's got to be superficial. If you're going to draw a crowd, you kind of have to be vanilla. Don't do anything edgy. Don't call people to anything profound or sacrificial because if you want to keep the crowd, you've got to keep it. There's some assumptions. There's some thinking about that around the crowd. Another thing is this, that in the megachurch, the primary focus is all about the crowd. And often, not in every megachurch, but often success in the megachurch is measured by the size of the crowd. Assuming things like this, that if people are coming to the service and filling the seats, listening to the sermon, and singing the songs, they must, just by virtue of the fact that they're around all that, they must be changing. They must be growing. Well, it was about six years ago. We quit making that assumption. I think what happens in this room on Sunday morning and Saturday is really important. And there are ways it's hard to duplicate in any other place. But to assume that just because people participate in this, automatically they're growing. Don't make that assumption. And we quit making that assumption some time ago so that now I can tell you in absolute truth that in the heart of every single staff person here at Open Door and that at the root of every single ministry we have, be it children's ministry or our membership process or pre-marriage courses or weekend services or small groups or training center or missions projects or men's ministry, women's ministry, youth ministry, whatever. Driving every one of those things behind every one of those things is a passionate intent to do everything we can to help people understand and then to experience the real gospel of the kingdom of God in such a way that it begins to create a real difference in your real life, thereby making a real impact in the real world. Now, how we're doing at all of that is another story. And that could be up for debate. I can tell you this, again, in all truth, that behind the scenes, when it comes to this issue of how we're doing at that, we are constantly wondering about that. we're constantly examining that we're constantly tweaking it and changing it and we're not going to do that thing anymore it's just not accomplishing we're going to start doing it try to do that i don't know if it's going to work but we're going to because moving toward sometimes we even argue and we have wonderfully heated arguments sometimes it's a wonderful thing to argue about it's not about whether the core value is around creating a transforming environment and mechanisms that bring people into transformation. The arguments about this is working, this ain't working. And are we fooling ourselves to think that this is working? Do you think the church is capable of fooling itself? Does any church go, well, I think we're doing a marvelous work for God. How do you know? Well, a lot of people are there. A lot of people are there. So how we're doing at this is something you need to be, we need to be, all the time, examining, but, but, but, make no mistake about one thing, about one thing. This issue of authentic transformation and trying to figure out how it actually happens so that you and I can become a different kind of person, primarily a more loving kind of person, so that I and you can be in an environment and in a community and have access to teaching and whatever kind of mechanisms are necessary that I can learn how to love my wife and love my kids and my wife loved me. That's the big one. And that's the miracle. Hallelujah. And make no mistake that that is what we're aiming at and that that is what we desire and that is what we're programming and planning for at every, every single level of ministry in this church. And that is why when I hear that we've grown 50% in the last five months, I don't automatically do cartwheels because I'm not entirely sure what it means. that we've grown 50% in five months. But when my friend Duane comes up to me and says, Dave, we've been here at Open Door for 10 years and we've grown in just a whole number of ways, but we just went through that membership process. And you know what? It changed my life. Those four words, it changed my life. I know what those words mean. See, I know what that means. You know what that means? That means in some small way in his life, the kingdom has come. And that's why we're here. And that's why we're here. But that's not the only reason we're here. That leads me to the second foundational pillar that I believe will help us move beyond belief as a church, as a people, not just as individuals, but God's calling out a church here, a group of people. It's this. Here's the second pillar. That this transformation we are talking about and trying to figure out how it actually happens and then actually experiencing this transformation that we're actually beginning to experience that it would begin to intentionally spill over and rub off on the community we live in and the city we share with hundreds of thousands of people. Now, when I get a picture of what I just said actually happened, the second pillar, that a significant number of people are authentically experiencing the kind of transformation into the life and character of Christ, that would make them more loving people spilling off into the culture, now I do get excited about numbers. Because if what you have is 50 people who really are looking and living more and more like the life and the love of Christ is the center of their lives and it's really spilling out, you have an impact. But what if you have 500 of those? What if you had 5,000 where the authentic transformation was taking place and that authentic life of God, kingdom of God was spilling out. Now you've got the potential to affect the city, to change the city. And the city we affect might never ever come here. It's not about coming here. It was a delightful experience last Sunday morning. Early in the morning, I get the paper, I throw it down, and I got to preach. So I just, I wanted to get over my notes, and I'll read the paper in the afternoon, and I just needed to get quiet and be with God and pull out my notes, and my eyes glanced down, and I saw the word evangelical on the front page of the paper. Evangelical front page, that's where they picked it up. I saw a picture, and it looked like our church. It was Jeannie Barlowski and her husband Tim, and there they were on the front page, so I read the article instead of studying my sermon. That's why I was so bad last week. Anyway, and I was, it was, One of the things I loved about the article was they didn't interview any staff. It was just some people from our church. Stick a microphone in their face and see what they say. Here's what she said. A couple of the quotes. We're ordinary people. She said, lives have been touched by something extraordinary. She did not mean open door. She meant God. And my heart went, no. And then she said this. If the power and presence of God is really as wonderful as we say it is, It should be spilling out the front door of your house and changing the world. It should be spilling out the front door of your house. And I'm thinking, preach it, preach it. She's preaching better than I do. Get that? This is real life, real people doing their real life in the real world. And if there's one, that's incredible. If there's 50, that's better. What if there were 5,000 people? See, then that's the only time I can get excited about numbers, if it's really happening. people are coming under really coming under the rule and reign of God and then it spills off on their wife and their husband remember the kingdom of God right here right now starts with my heart I'm not doing the world we get to the world after it starts in my heart like a mustard seed my heart, my marriage, my life my love into my kids and into my wife and her into me and then from there we'll go to friends and then from there we'll go to church and then from there we'll go to a neighborhood and then from there we'll go, and it starts to ripple out. And so we pray that kingdom come. Pillar number one, transformation. Pillar number two, reaching out to serve. And like the issue of transformation, this thing of reaching out to serve, spilling over into the culture has taken root among us by way of story as well, by way of our journey. The reason this is so important to us, and I think you picked this up, is not because we went to a conference and came back with a new idea. These are things that God has been birthing in us for years. Truth is that this issue of reaching out and giving away what God has given us has not always marked this church. I think a defining moment for us, at least symbolically, was September 2, 2002. was the last weekend at the Crystal Building Saturday night at Earl Brown Center on Sunday morning we were concluding our series of sermons on money, sex, and power if you were there I'm sure you remember it was a service of consecration consecrating that weekend our power by embracing the symbol of the basin and the towel remember that? It was a communion service and people came first to the table and we partook of the bread and the cup and basically that was about remembering how Jesus has given to us. And from that station, we went to another station right next to it where you put your hands together and someone wrapped a towel around you and said these words as they looked you in the eye and they said, as you have been given to, now give. As Jesus has served you, now serve. Because we believe that rightly ordered power is most clearly revealed when we use our power, when we use our resources and our strength to lift and to serve and to help and to heal. And we came to Maple Grove to occupy this building, I believe, a different kind of people than we were two years ago. It wasn't just all about that. That consecration service symbolically spoke to something that I believe, and I think you do too if you've been with us, it spoke symbolically to something that God really was doing among us and is doing among us. We came here at different people than we were two years ago, with a different kind of spirit than we had two years ago, in fact, than I have ever seen here at Open Door. They were marked by an eagerness to serve, marked by an eagerness to really be, to really be a city set on a hill that can't be hid, to let our light shine in such a way that we win the argument now. No! To let our light shine in such a way that people would just see. They're doing good things. They seem to love people. They're not just trying to win the argument. They came here to serve. And by them seeing those good things, they would begin to almost inadvertently glorify our Father who is in heaven. I think Tom Johnson said it best, and I think he may have said it first when he said, Wouldn't it be something? Wouldn't it just be something? If someday the most hardened cynic in Maple Grove would really be glad this church is here because what we did when we came was not to throw our weight around and conquer, win the argument as it were. But we came and when we did, we stooped to serve invisible, practical, and tangible ways because we have come to believe, beloved, that it is as we do, as we do those kinds of things that we will begin to see the inbreakings of the kingdom of God on earth right here and right now for it is in the doing that we will move beyond belief. And so we pray, thy kingdom come. Next week, I want to talk some more about what we think it means to move beyond belief as a church. And even more practically, nuts and bolts, we want to share with you and reveal to you not just where we think we are as a church, but where it is we think we are to go and what it is we think we are to do as God calls us to move beyond belief. Beyond belief. To move beyond belief in how we spend our time. To move beyond belief in how we spend our money and move beyond belief and how we spend our lives. Move beyond belief in involvements in Maple Grove, but to move beyond Maple Grove. To take care of what's going on in here, spread it out to Maple Grove, but beyond Maple Grove, to move into Minneapolis with a kingdom endeavor. Next week, in fact, we're going to begin to introduce to you two bold kingdom moves that we feel led by God to make. And so we pray that kingdom come. Let me close with this. we are living these days as you know in very dark uncertain times it's a very strange thing to wake up every morning i told my wife this yesterday strange thing to wake up every morning and one of the first things i want to do before i do anything is find out if we've gone to war or not that's a strange time to live it's a time we live in because of that kind of darkness and uncertainty there's a tendency on a part of everyone and certainly on the part of the church from time to time historically to when things are dark and uncertain, you want to dig a hole and climb in it. You want to build a wall and hide behind it. But I just couldn't be more convinced of anything than what Jesus is saying to his church in these days is this, do not dig a hole and climb in it. In fact, if you're in a hole, climb out of it. Do not build a wall and hide behind it. In fact, if you're behind a wall, get out from it. For when the times are dark, and the times are uncertain, it is the most incredible opportunity for the church to be the church. To come out and to be a people who are experiencing the amazing grace of God, the life of the kingdom of God, and then to go out and give it away. So we come back to this locker room every weekend and for a variety of things and we come back and we get reminded of why we do what we do. And sometimes as we use that locker room analogy in the past, we come back here and you've been out there in battle and you're worn out and maybe you failed and you didn't do real well and you come back in here and you get healed. But the point is to come back here so we can go out there and spill out on the culture for such a time as this. Never has it been more important for us to be who God's called us to be as his people bringing the kingdom right here, right now. And all God's people said, Amen. Father, we thank you for, I thank you for the workings of your Spirit in this church. It is an overwhelming thing for me even to go back into the story a bit and just remember. It encourages me for where we're going. And I confess, Father, and maybe we could do this together, the times I want to dig a hole and climb in it and build a wall and hide behind it. I confess the ways I wanted to do that this week. And I thank you that you won't let us do it. You just keep calling us out, and you keep calling us out. And we want to say that today we believe you, and we're going to trust you, and we're going to come out of our holes, and we're going to come from behind our walls. And we want to be your people, living in a big story of the kingdom of God. We pray these things be real among us, In Jesus' name, amen.
