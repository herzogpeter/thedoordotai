A voice of one calling. In the desert, prepare the way of the Lord. Make straight. In the wilderness, a highway for our God. Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low. The rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain. And the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all mankind will see it together. Then the desert and the dry land will be glad. The wilderness will rejoice and blossom. It will burst into bloom. It will rejoice greatly and shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness, and the streams in the desert. The burning sand will become a pool, and the thirsty ground a bubbling spring. There came a man sent from God, his name was John. And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you? And he confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, I am not the Christ. They asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the prophet? And he answered, No. Then they said to him, Who are you? So that we may give you an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself? He said, I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness. Make straight the way of the Lord, as Isaiah the prophet said. And so it is that John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And all the country of Judea was going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem, and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Fascinating text. It's hard to kind of connect all the dots, but in the Isaiah text that you heard, there was talk of a desert. John the Baptist is this desert wilderness guy, and back to the Isaiah picture, there's this time when water begins to flow in the desert, where the desert blooms. Wow, wow, the desert blooms. Is that pizza coming? Anyway, some of you are in a desert. I mean, you get the metaphor. And for water to come to that dry place, wow, what would that take? Fathers, we consider these things. In this Advent season, help this story, your story, the story that we are in, come alive to us. Help us see where we are in it. Amen. This week in the first, well actually the second week of Advent where the theme was prepare, we heard as it were a voice, the voice of one crying in the wilderness. And the voice was saying this, we need to get ready, we need to prepare for the coming of the King, for the arrival of this light. And the voice had a name, it was John. They called him the baptizer, John the Baptist actually. Some thought he was a prophet, the prophet. Some thought he was the prophet. Some thought he was Elijah, maybe even Elijah, maybe even the Christ, the anointed one. He was pretty good. Lots of stuff was happening. Maybe he is the one we're expecting, Messiah. But if the people were confused as to who John was, John wasn't, because he knew that he was not the light, that he was not Messiah, because he knew that he had come to bear witness to the light. talked about this last week, John 1 verse 8, I came to testify to be the one who would point to the light as if to say it's over there. It's not me, it's him. John 1 verse 9, because there is a true light, says John, this Baptist, baptizing guy. There is the true light come into the world, and when it does, it will enlighten every man, every woman, every one, because that's what lights do, but I am not the light, John said. I'm just the voice. Indeed, I am the voice, says John in John 1, 23, of one crying in the wilderness. So it's time, and this is what he's saying, to get ready. It's time to prepare. So prepare ye the way for the coming of the light, for the coming of the king. The text says that he came preaching. And the word there is heralding, and heralding is what heralds do. We said last week, indeed, heralds were actual people back in these days that had two responsibilities, particularly when something of significance was going to happen in a city. And a thing of significance would be when the king or someone of royalty was visiting. When that would happen, the herald's job was twofold. one, they would announce the coming of the king. That's clearly what John the Baptist is doing. But the other thing they would do would be to prepare the way. And the way for the coming of a physical king was the road, and literally a physical road. And this road would lead into the city, their job being this, to make sure it was clear, to prepare the way, to make ready the road by removing the obstacles, cleaning up the junk that might be in the road, thus preventing the king from having easy access into the city because sometimes there were things in the road like boulders we talked about, even trees that had fallen, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose because the enemy had kings and would want to block the king from coming into the city because if the king comes into the city, he will win the hearts of men and women and kids as well and the enemy would then lose power, so we need to prevent this. But sometimes what was blocking the entrance of the king into the city was just clutter that was collecting in the road, the kind of clutter that just accumulates over time slowly, so you don't really even notice that it's there. You just get used to it, so you don't really see it anymore, that the road is actually getting clogged. You don't notice anymore that your heart is actually getting cold and even hard. You don't even notice because it happened over time that your eyes have grown dim and your ears have grown dull. But then you hear this voice, this voice of one crying in the wilderness. And the wilderness is far away, but it's crying. It's a loud voice. So even with your ears having grown dull, it's loud enough to hear. And what the voice says is it's time to get ready. It's time to prepare for the coming of the king, for the shining of this light. But to prepare means we have some work to do, you guys. And the work we've got to do is hard work. Hard work. Hard work is heart work because we've got to get rid of the clutter. All this garbage in the road and boulders as well because they've accumulated over time. They've accumulated for years all this anger that is still right in the middle of this road. and your pride and your anxiety, your fear, your bitterness, your arrogance, and your blindness, too. You don't even know you're blind and deaf. And so the people came, which actually is kind of amazing that they began to come out to John, who was in the wilderness. They heard the voice in the wilderness, and so that's where they had to go. They had to go to the wilderness. And when they came, they came, it says, confessing their sin. As if to say, you know, I've heard this voice before, but this time, I don't know why, but this time I'm ready. I'm so sick of this junk. I'm just so tired of this stuff in the way. All this garbage in my proverbial road that keeps me from hearing the voice of God and experiencing the life of God. It's all this junk that's ruining my marriage and my family and on and on and on. We go, these people, these people. It's like, you're tired. I'm just tired of these boulders in the road. But again, it's not just some physical road we're talking about. It's my heart that's grown cold and my eyes that have grown dim and my ears that are dull. But then you hear, but then you hear this voice. This voice of one crying in the wilderness. and it's in the wilderness, so it's far away, but it's a loud voice, so even with your dull ears, you can still hear it, but then you recognize what's really going on here. It's a voice coming in the wilderness, and if I'm going to go toward that voice, it's a voice that's actually inviting me into the wilderness. And here's the truth about the wilderness. The wilderness is a place I don't want to go there, But the voice is out there, and so I heard the voice, and I went toward the voice, and there he was. His name is John. Isaiah the prophet spoke of him in Mark 1, verse 2. One of the texts we just heard says this, just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet. Isaiah spoke of this. Behold, I send a messenger ahead of you who will prepare the way. And this guy has a voice. Indeed, he is the voice. He's the voice of one crying in the wilderness. And what he will say is make ready the way, make straight the path. And then this voice appeared. It says in verse 4, John the Baptist appeared. There he was. And he appeared in the wilderness. Very significant. In the wilderness he appeared. And what he was doing was preaching, heralding a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. the strangest thing happened because when this voice began to be heard in the wilderness, all the country of Judea, are you kidding? All the country of Judea, everybody was going out to him, which is where in the wilderness, they went into the wilderness, and all the people of Jerusalem too were going toward that voice, which brought them into the wilderness. And I'm just telling you, the wilderness, you know this about yourself, is the place you do not want to go. but when they went to him they were being baptized by him. It says in the Jordan River which is powerfully symbolic. You know where the Jordan River is. The Jordan River is what the people one day cross from the wilderness into the promised land. They're being baptized in this place kind of between and they were confessing their sins all of which raises a number of questions. The first is this. What's all that about? The wilderness stuff. What's all that about? It's just everywhere in these texts. And what on earth can this wilderness thing have to do with Advent? Because Advent is joy and peace and love and hope. And this is depressing wilderness stuff. Well, as it turns out, this wilderness has a lot to do with all of that. Because the wilderness, as it turns out, is a uniquely suited place. actually, we know this, to prepare. The wilderness is a uniquely suited place to do the thing John says we need to do, get ready to repent. The wilderness is a uniquely suited place to learn how to wait for your deliverance, to feel actually the dryness that we're desperately trying to avoid. Go into the wilderness. You won't be able to hide anymore. There it is. Wilderness is an incredibly effective place to actually hear this voice. It's fascinating. In study this week, all four Gospels, when speaking of this voice, say it this way. The voice crying in the wilderness, get ready, prepare the way. And they're out quoting Isaiah 40. But when you go to Isaiah 40, this was weird. Isaiah 40 says it this way. the voice crying out saying this. The wilderness is where you prepare. The desert is where you make the path straight. I think you hear the difference. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, he's in the wilderness. Isaiah actually said it. A voice crying out in the wilderness is where you get ready. It's where you prepare. And all of that is Advent waiting for water to flow that you think will never come. So let's talk about the wilderness just a little bit. You know, when you think about wilderness, I don't know about you, but I grew up in church. So the first thing I think of when I think of a wilderness experience, kind of in the story of the people of God, I think of the wilderness wanderings. maybe you do too, of the people of God having just been delivered from slavery and Egypt and Pharaoh, they've crossed the Red Sea, which is a symbol of their redemption. And then after kind of getting saved, as it were, from Pharaoh and Egypt and the baptism is the Red Sea, they spend 40 years like, I don't know, a lot of people I know do, wandering. Saved. We're people of God, but they wander in the desert for 40 years. So right off the bat, we know some things though about the desert. it is for the people listening to these stories a physical reality. We know that deserts are physical realities but most of us don't spend a lot of time in them. You've maybe visited them. Deserts, physical deserts were very real to these people and people went to these places. Jesus went to a desert having been, I think it's Matthew 4, all the gospels speak of this, having been led by the Spirit into the, what, wilderness. He spent 40 days. What's this 40 number? That's for somebody smarter than me, but it keeps showing up. 40 days in a dry and barren place, which is a place you don't want to go. Moses went there too. This was part of their life. He physically went. In fact, before the 40 years of wandering in the desert with the people of God, he spent 40 years before that in the backside of a Midian desert. And that experience was, well, here's that preparation again for his ability to lead the people through the other long desert. And then there's Elijah who fled to the, guess what, desert, the wilderness, after he conquered the prophets of Baal and Jezebel, threatened him with his life. So he ran, like you do, to the dry place, to the barren place, to the place of desolation and isolation, to the wilderness where he just wanted to die because that's how you feel when you're in the desert. David went there too. You start getting the idea here. And they physically went there. David being tormented and hounded by Saul who in a jealous rage was hunting him down through deserts and caves. And David had 10 years. Wow, seriously? I love that. But beyond the physical reality of a desert Which we kind of got to dial into They didn't because they could feel the desert physically Beyond all the physical reality of the physical wilderness To which people physically went Is the obvious spiritual significance of the wilderness Indeed most of us think of the spiritual part of this I think first Because instinctively we kind of know that the desert is metaphor It is real, but not physical, but it's metaphor also for not just a physical dry place, but a spiritually dry place. Because when I'm in a dry place, emotionally or spiritually, I know it's a desert. In fact, that's how you would check in. How are you doing? I'm in a dry place. I'm in a desert place. And what I know about the desert is this. It's a place I hate going. The desert is a place we do not want to go Indeed I don't know anyone who would willingly go To the desert to get all thirsty And stuff because the desert is dry and barren It's a place of isolation and desolation It doesn't flow with milk and honey God's promise was milk and honey But I am not tasting it here And you even kind of get mad in the desert Because it's hot in the day and it's cold at night But then they heard this voice this voice of one crying in the wilderness. This wilderness I would avoid at all costs, but then I heard this voice out there, and this time all the country of Judea, and Jerusalem as well, was going out to this voice, to this guy named John. They were following that voice, but to follow the voice, you had to go into this yucky place because they were going into the wilderness. Again, very evocative, this image here, because those people knew about the desert. Not just emotionally, they knew about it physically. And that's sometimes a place you die. But it's also sometimes they knew a place God calls you to go. See, sometimes you end up in the desert because you lost your way. You know, how did I get here? But sometimes, I hate this too. The desert is the place that God invites you to, indeed Jesus himself. Here we go, Matthew 4, 1. I already said this. Jesus was led by the who? Oh, I hate that. Into the what? Oh, man. There was God who called him there, Exodus 13, same thing. At the beginning of their story. So rooted in their soul by now is this story. Here's the story, verse 17. It came about, Exodus 13, verse 17, came about that when Pharaoh had let the people go, God did the strangest thing, because God did not lead them, by the way, of the Philistines, even though it was near, which means if they would have gone that way, it would have been close. The promised land, if they would have gone the way God didn't let them go, would have been two weeks' journey, because it's straight. It's straight. We're going through the Philistines, but it's straight. It's right over. I can see it from here. but God instead led the people, look at the verse, around, by the way, of the wilderness. Because sometimes it's God who leads you there. God who calls you there. Sometimes it's God who meets you there. And the fact that sometimes it's God who calls you there is an important thing to know on your journey because we tend to think, maybe you don't, but I do, that if I'm in a dry place, if I'm in a wilderness, desert place, my first instinct around that whole thing is this. I must have done something wrong. How did I get here? I took a wrong turn. I must have taken a wrong turn. I thought I heard him say left, and here I am. Missed it completely. I must not be listening very closely, not following very well. Here I'm the pastor thinking I'm the follower. I'm not. How did I get here into this dry place, because I thought following God meant you'd be in milk and honey all the time, probably harboring some secret sin, so I start repenting of things and making them up, although actually I don't have to make things up. So it's Satan. Maybe it's Satan. After I get tired of beating myself up, it isn't me. It's Satan. I rebuke you in the name of whatever. And maybe maybe it's Moses. I mean, what kind of leader is he anyway? How does he know he's hearing from God? I think he's lost. I just wish he'd asked for directions because he's taking us with him because we should be in the promised land by now. I'm serious. Maybe we should be having milk and honey by now. But sometimes it's God who calls you there. And that's very irritating. See, one of the qualities of God that's very irritating to get it done, kind of people like you and me, is this, that God is never in a hurry. And that bugs me, but also this bugs me. He has an agenda. God has an agenda for me, for you, for us that's different than mine. My agenda is very clear. Milk and honey is what I want. It is. God promised it. You know, we can stand on the promises. That's what I want. Milk and honey, and I know how to get there. It's right there. Go straight. My agenda. Let's get there. Just do it. Solved a problem. Reached a goal. I want this way and fast. Right out of the chute, God says. That way and slow. Huh. Okay. Okay. Because his agenda is different than mine. I just want to get there. And his agenda is, I don't want to just deposit you, Dave, in the promised land. I actually want to transform you. So we're going to go on the roundabout way. I hate that. Because sometimes it's God who leads us there. Sometimes it's God who calls us into the wilderness, but it's God also who meets you there. So when they heard this voice, this voice of one crying in the wilderness, they followed, that is, the whole country of Judea, and all of Jerusalem too, they went out into the desert, Because sometimes there are things in the desert that you can't learn any other place. There are things in the wilderness that you won't be able to hear any other place. But in the wilderness, and in your mind, I think, you know that's true. I think. But even when you do know it's true, the desert is still a hard place to be. And it's an even harder place to stay, which is why I love this Advent prayer I discovered this week. I think I told you last week that I was, my wife and I are doing this, and a few of our staff, I think, are doing this as well, going through Ruth Haley Barton's Advent Reflections. And at the end of this particular week, she offered this prayer. I want to read it to you and just sit in it for a minute. Let's put it up on the screen. It says this, Holy one, and quiet your own heart here. There are barren places in my life. Some of you know that's true. There are barren places in my life that I'm avoiding by trying to find my own way out. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm in a desert, and I desperately want to get out, but I'm going to get my own way out. How do you get out of the desert your own way? Richard Rohr says about this kind of thing, that we who live in first world countries are at a disadvantage to knowing how to stay in these places and hear from God. Fourth world people know, because in their poverty, which we would want to cure them of, and we should, they don't have any way out of the desert. We have ways out. Go watch a movie. I mean, it just gives you a few minutes. Go buy a car. Go on vacation. Go have a drink. I know how I can get rid of this wilderness wife. I'll get a new one. That's how I'm out of the desert. I got my own way out. I got my own way out. A few people will stay and wait for the voice. I have a friend. His name is Steve. He will come back to this prayer. He grew up in this church, actually. He did some bad things. and he had some bad things done to him and putting those two together put him in a desert. And when you're in a desert, dry and barren place, you try to get out. Try to find your own way out and there's lots of ways to get out and he tried them, he tried them and so it's all the classic things you do to get out of the desert, you know, the booze, whatever, you know, drink a little bit more, do a little bit more. In fact, he even did religion. He even got religion to get out of the desert And that didn't help either. So he stayed, this guy I know, for 10 years. And he began to wait and say, God, okay, I'm going to stay here. And start really dealing with my clutter in the road. Really dealing with this stuff. And then the streams in the desert began to flow. We returned to the prayer. Holy one, there are barren places in my life that I'm avoiding by trying to find my own way out. Help me to trust. Next part of the prayer. That if I follow you into the wilderness of the Spirit and wait with you there, you will meet me with gifts I might never receive any other way. So when they heard this voice, this voice, when crying in the wilderness, they followed the voice. Indeed, all the country of Judea and even Jerusalem was going out to that voice in the wilderness. Fascinating story about the wilderness. In fact, Genesis 16 is the first example in Scripture of the wilderness. This is the first time anybody went into the wilderness. And I remember when I was hearing this from this dear man that a number of us were studying with the Scriptures. His name was Rabbi. He was a rabbi, Rabbi Allen. and he said this is the first example of a wilderness thing in the scriptures and the first example of anything is really kind of a big thing. But I was surprised to learn that the first example was Hagar because he asked the question, what was the first example of the wilderness? And I actually shut up when he's around because he knows way more than me. But it was Hagar. Hagar. Hagar, who in Genesis 16, you probably know the story, is running from Sarah, who is the wife of Abraham. You remember the story. the promise had come to Abraham and Sarah. You will be the father of many nations. You will have a son. And when Sarah heard that promise to Abraham and to herself, she laughed because she was looking at Abraham. It ain't gonna happen. Not with him and not with me, because her womb was barren. She was past, they were both past their age. So Sarah came up with a plan after they waited a while, because God wasn't showing up and doing what he said he would do, so we'll use Hagar to make this happen. So Abraham went into Hagar, and she conceived, and when she conceived, Sarah despised her, it says in Genesis 16, and that is why Hagar ran from her presence. In Genesis 16, verse 7 says this, that an angel of the Lord found Hagar sitting by a spring of water in the wilderness, in the dry place. So there's the first place. And he asked Hagar two questions. Fascinating, because it tells you something about the wilderness. The first question was this, Hagar, where have you come from? This is verse eight. It's the first question. Second question, where are you going? And Hagar answered the first question. Notice, she said, here's where I'm coming from. I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress, Sarah. But she didn't answer the second question. This is where I'm from. She doesn't answer where she's going. You know why? She doesn't know. And then the rabbi teaching this said, and that's how you know you're in the wilderness. Because you know where you come. You know what you've left, that relationship or that season or that way of thinking. I don't know. That job. You know what you've left, but you haven't arrived at the new. you're in, you're in the wilderness. And the wilderness is the place you don't want to go. But the wilderness is where, uh-oh, the wilderness is where you hear the voice. Indeed, verse 13 of Genesis 16 says this, that Hagar called upon the name of the Lord, and the Lord spoke to her. Huge, this is very powerful. In the wilderness, he spoke to her in the wilderness. Indeed, the wilderness comes from the root word in the Hebrew, which means to speak. So the wilderness, whatever else it is, it's a dry and barren place. It's a place of isolation. It's a place of desolation. It's the place where God speaks. Okay. And I hate that. Because I hate the wilderness. And so do you. Because the wilderness is scary and dark and unsettling, unknown. But all through the scriptures, beloved, you know it's true. These wilderness places are actually places of conversion. They are places of transformation. They are places of surrender and repentance, humility and grace. Richard Raw calls them liminal. It's liminal space. I love that word just because it sounds kind of, I have no idea what it means. Liminal space is sacred space. Liminal space is that space between. It's when you're in the wilderness. You've left something. You haven't come to the new. It's this place of unknowing. He calls it sacred space. And the reason this wilderness space is sacred space is because this is where God speaks. This is where people change. Think about it. It's very easy. Because if you're in the known, why would you change it? This is what I know. Even if it's sick, I know it. So I'll keep it. You know that. And then for whatever reason, God calls you out or you move out or you get kicked out of that safe place that was a dead place. but you never change in that place and then this is the place you change because it's often in the wilderness when you're feeling kind of lost that you finally, finally hear the voice, the voice of one crying in the wilderness and it's the voice of God saying, it's time to prepare, it's time to get ready, it's time to repent, It's time to lay down all that junk you're holding. It's time to let go. There's the question on the screen, remember? What do you need to let go of in the wilderness? It's time to let go of, I don't know, whatever you have to let go of. It's time to listen and it's time to wait. And if you wait there long enough and meet with God and hear his voice, that's when the streams begin to flow. I've heard these verses all my life. Isaiah 35, a desert will bloom. Oh, won't it be great someday? Water in the desert. It sounds like magic. And then I think of my friend. I think of times I have been invited even into the wilderness. And I went, and you've done it too. And it's dry and barren. And you wait, and you listen, and you hear. And before you know it, no, no, no. It sometimes takes longer than I want. Water. Waters break forth in the wilderness. Streams in the desert and the scorched land becomes a pool. Anything I told you about my friend, Steve? Streams of water. Not only to him, but everybody around him now gets wet from the water flowing from his life because he went. to the desert. Let me close with Ruth's prayer. In fact, let's, I don't know, stand or sit. Sit. Executive decision. And just, would you, you know, you don't have to, but this would be something to invite God into. Maybe holding your hands out. Holy One, Holy One, we know that there are barren places in our life. And we know that these barren places in our life and lives, We are avoiding. Because we're trying desperately to find our own way out. So Holy One. Help us to trust. That if we follow you into the wilderness. Of the Spirit and wait with you there. You will meet us with gifts that we might never receive any other way. So God revealed to us where in our lives are we resisting entering these wilderness places, places that require letting go of some things that we think we have to have. and then I heard this voice the voice of one crying in the wilderness and the voice cried out it is in the wilderness that you prepare it is in the desert place you clean the road so that streams of water can flow so that the desert can blossom so that Christmas can come and this is the spirit of Advent I pray in Jesus name help us enter in to these invitations that literally are invitations to life and I pray it in Jesus name and all God's people said, amen.
