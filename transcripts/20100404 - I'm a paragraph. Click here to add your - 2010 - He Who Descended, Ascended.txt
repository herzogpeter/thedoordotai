Some of you do. You could probably give me these lines and sing it like a song we've sung many times. To Satan and all the demons of hell, to the spirits now in prison, here is the proclamation. What you meant for evil, God meant for good. What you suppose was your greatest victory is in fact your ultimate defeat. I win, you lose, bye-bye. And he blew open the gates of hell because he who descended also ascended. boy you're easy took his right place at the right hand of the father sent his spirits establishing his church alive forevermore is he but all of that if you kind of keep on thinking raises another question that actually i've never heard anybody deal with um until i i read a book a few years ago entitled destined for the throne by a guy named Paul Bilheimer. And the question he raises, and it's a good question when you think about it, kind of hold all these facts together. The question was this. What was happening the rest of the time? From the time he descended after he physically died to that time he ascended on the resurrection the third day. What was happening in between those two events? Anything? Nothing? In the lower parts of the earth. What was he doing there? making a proclamation and just leaving? Was there more? Did he take a nap? What's going on? Well, the fact is, we don't know, actually, for sure. But again, we get some clues. And that's really all they are, and we kind of track them down and do some thinking. Hebrews 2, verse 9 brings one of those clues, I think, to us, where it says, in effect, here's what he was doing when he descended into the lower parts of the earth. It was in the lower parts of the earth. that he was tasting death for every man. He tasted death in hell. Think on that, he tasted death. Because what's weird about that, I've always assumed that he tasted death on the cross, and he did, but think a little further with this because the truth is, Jesus didn't actually taste death on the cross. You're talking like a heretic. No, no, he tasted the process of death on the cross. and it was an agonizing process. See, it wasn't until he actually died and descended into the lower parts of the earth, descended into hell, that he literally tasted death. When he was on the cross, he was tasting the process of death and then he breathed his laugh and then he died and when he died, he tasted death. He was forced as to when he died, he descended into the lower parts of the earth and there he tasted death and he tasted it in hell for three days. Whoa. Now, to really capture the scope of what I'm trying to describe here, this death that he tasted in the lower parts of the earth, or hell, if you will, I want to bring you back in your mind's eye just to kind of rewind the tape of this whole event just a little bit to Mark chapter 14 and Luke chapter 22. Jesus, just prior to the cross events, is preparing himself for the agony that's ahead in the Garden of Gethsemane. The Garden of Gethsemane. Picture it in your mind's eye. I think you probably have some sort of picture of that. He's speaking these words first to his disciples, and then he's speaking these words to the Father. Mark 14, verse 34. My soul is deeply grieved. Even to the point of death, remain here, he says to his friends, and keep watch with me in this agonizing time. Then he went a little beyond his disciples, fell to the ground, and began to pray that if it were possible, this cup might pass him by, saying, Abba, Father, all things are possible for thee. Remove this cup from me. I don't want to have to drink it. I don't want to have to taste what is in it. Luke 22, verse 43, then says that an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. And the reason the angel came to strengthen him was because, for among other reasons, the answer from the father was no. I love you dearly, but there is no other way. What is in the cup is something that you will have to drink, you will have to taste. And being in agony, he continued to pray fervently, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling down upon the ground. So here's my question about that. What was in that cup? The anticipation of which could cause such agony. What was he, by drinking this cup, about to taste? Well, part of the answer to that question, I think, is obvious. In the physical arena, it's what we all can see obvious. What he's anticipating is the physical agony that he's about to experience on the cross. That would certainly be enough for me to wreck my day really big. big historians tell us and i i think you know this that there are a few more painful ways to die than by crucifixion romans were really good at inflicting pain and and with that pain a kind of terror with that as well um so certainly it was anticipating the physical agony of the cross that was the cause for his agony the physical agony there therefore was part of what was in the cup, what he was about to drink, what he was about to taste. But you need to understand this, that there was more than that going on, that there was more than the physical pain of the cross in the spirit of Jesus, in the mind of Jesus, as he was sweating drops of blood, asking for this cup to be passed. Indeed, I believe there was so much more than what we physically see with the crucifixion, that the crucifixion, in my mind now, is actually kind of a picture of the things he actually suffered. Which may sound kind of strange to you. I see it this way, that his physical suffering is actually what we can see. And therefore that's what we can relate to. And it stirs up the kind of emotions that ought to be stirred up in terms of our thankfulness to him that he's willing to do that kind of thing for us. But the crucifixion was really only what we could see and relate to and understand. Consider now the suffering of his spirit, of his soul. And as you do know this, that this was in the cup as well, that this was the death he tasted for every man. The cross was the process of dying. When he died, he tasted death, and that was in the cup as well. Now, to picture the fullness of this thing I'm trying to describe, I understand it this way. As the physical body of Jesus is dying, unseen by physical eyes, a terrible, wonderful transaction is taking place in the spiritual realm. The Bible tells us that the sin of the world is coming upon his head. It's being laid upon him. It's staining, as it were, his very soul. So get the picture. In his body, though his body is dying, this is back at Good Friday, his body is dying, his spirit, his soul is very much alive, 1 Peter 3, 18. And as his body dies, he is in the process of becoming sin. Lots of theology here. 2 Corinthians 5, 21 says that he who knew no sin became sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Christ. 1 Peter 2, 24 says this. He himself bore our sin in his body and his spirit on the tree, on the cross. Galatians 3.13 says he became, while dying, a curse for us. But put all that together. While he is physically dying, he is spiritually becoming sin. Just before his physical death, having become sin, the Father turns his back. Oh. He is dying. Therefore, the worst possible way a human being can die. And I'm not talking anymore about the crucifixion alone. The crucifixion might be one of the worst ways you can physically die. But he is dying with a sin-stained soul. The sin of the world is on him. He became sin. And when he died, Isaiah 44, Psalm 63, 1 Peter 4, 19, Ephesians 4, 9, all indicate that with the sin of the world on him, he descended with that sin on him into hell, where because of the sin that was on him, hell had a legal right to do what hell does to sinners, to sin, to punish it. And that's where we get this picture of all hell's fury being unleashed on Jesus in payment for sin, but it wasn't his sin. It was yours and mine and ours and that, beloved, is the death he tasted for every man. And that is where, in the lower parts of the earth, Jesus paid the price for our sin, and that is where he died in my place and in your place. Somebody ask a question at this point. This would be a good question, especially if you kind of know the story. What about what Jesus says when he said on the cross, it is finished? Well, my question to that question would be, this question. Well, what was finished? When he says it is finished, what was finished? Because he's not risen yet, so that's not finished. And without the resurrection, though we might have great sympathy for someone who was crucified, the story really is meaningless. So clearly, even though he said on the cross it is finished, there is more to do. Among other things, there is the resurrection. So what did it mean when he said it is finished? Well, I believe that what's finished is the necessary physical sacrifice of the spotless lamb of God that once completed will set into motion events in the spirit realm that now cannot be stopped, that now cannot be reversed. It is finished means he crossed the threshold. No turning back. Think about it. Because until the moment that he actually died, on the cross he was in the process of dying, but it wasn't until the moment he died. When that happened, up until that moment, he could have called, the Bible says, he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the earth and set him free, but he, what? Didn't. Instead, having become sin, he who knew no sin became sin, breathed his last, then did this horrific, hard, he then descended into the lower parts of the earth and there tasted death, tasted not the process, but tasted death for every man. He paid the price for sin in hell. Here's the deal. While all of us fear the process of death, you know, we kind of fear the suffering. Nobody wants to do that. I think the biggest question, even beyond that, the biggest fear is not the event, but the after. What's going to happen to me after I die? Beloved, the grip of death begins. The strength of death is felt when you die. Therefore, to break that grip requires going into that grip, requires experiencing that grip, tasting, if you will, that death, and that's what Jesus did. Jesus did not just experience the process of dying. He experienced the grip of death, the fury of hell. He descended into the lower parts and tasted their death for every man. But now I've got some good news for you. This is the euangelion that we preach from this pulpit in a variety of ways every single week. The euangelion is simply this, that the one who descended also ascended. He broke the power of sin and death. He blew open the gates of hell. He ascended to the Father, saying essentially this, Father, the mission has been accomplished. He sent his Spirit to live in and transform the lives of men and women and he loves his bride. And oh, when I saw him, says the apostle John, when the revelation came to him in Revelation 1, 18, John says, I fell at his feet as a dead man and he laid his right hand upon me saying, John, don't be afraid, it's me. And I am the first and the last, the alpha and the omega. I am the beginning and the end. I am, John, I am the living one. For I was dead, I was dead. But behold, I was dead, but behold. And behold means take a real good look, John. I am alive forevermore, and I have in my hand the keys of death and hell. In fact, I went to hell to get those keys to set you free. And here's how it happens, I think. Here's how the tables in hell got turned. This Christ, see, here's the real truth. This lamb, this spotless lamb, who bore in his body all of our sin was in fact an innocence. He did become sin, but it wasn't his. And because he was in fact an innocent, God could go to work on his behalf. And go to work on his behalf, God did. For while Satan had a party with Jesus at Jesus' expense, This party he was having was illegal, if you will. Satan was actually off his ground. He had no authority because in the court of heaven, Jesus had been judged and innocent. The tables are turned and God goes to war. In Acts chapter 2, verse 24, it says it this way. Then God raised Jesus up again, putting an end to the agony of his death. Stop right there. He put an end to the agony of his death. The end of the agony of his physical dying on the cross ended when? He died. And then he descended into the lower parts where he experienced death, and then God raised him up again, putting an end to the agony of that death because it wasn't able to hold him, but he was held by that death three days. The grip of hell, the fury of hell, held him for three days, but he was an innocent. Colossians 2.15 says that when he burst forth, ascended. He disarmed the principalities and the powers. It was as if God showed up in hell. It's the ultimate sting. And with the blood of Jesus, as it were, dripping off the hands of demons, God said, you had no authority to do this. You have no rights. And that is when the blood that they so enjoyed spilling became the cleansing blood. Here's the deal. He who descended also ascended. And as he did, he made a proclamation. And the proclamation was this to Satan and all the demons of hell. What you meant for evil, God meant for good. What you suppose was your greatest victory is actually your ultimate defeat. I hope you enjoyed yourself these last three days, because here's the eternal truth. I win, you lose. Bye-bye. And he blew open the gates of hell. hell could not keep him all the resources of the underworld including the grip of death itself could not hold him Psalm 107 16 says he broke the gates of brass he cut the bars of iron asunder and then he said with a loud voice to the apostle John and now we get to hear it. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the, and I am the first and the last. I am the living one, for I was dead, but behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have in my hands the keys of death and hell. I went to hell to get them in order to set you free from sin and death and hell and fear. Somebody say amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota.

This is not your grandfather's Easter service. You know, I'm telling you, when you tell these guys to pull out all the stops, It's a little scary what actually happens. Last night after the end of the service, I saw a guy kind of helping out his mother, his grandmother. She was kind of walking like this out of the service, and I was hoping she came in that way. I don't know if she was okay or not. Ephesians 4, verses 9 and 10 is a passage that actually is often overlooked in the Easter context, but here at Open Door, it's become kind of one of our perennial favorites. as among other things, that the one who ascended, descended, also ascended. That the one who died also rose. Ephesians 4, verse 9. Now this expression, he ascended, what does that mean? Except that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth. But he who descended is himself also the one who ascended far above the heavens that he might fill all things. And that, beloved, is why we are here this weekend, this Easter weekend, to celebrate the fact that he who descended also ascended, that he who died also rose. But before we do all that, before we celebrate all that, although we've already been doing some of that, I want us to examine something in that text that I just read. Easy to kind of just skim over and assume we know what it means that I find quite intriguing. Actually, at the beginning of my thinking of this, I found it a bit disturbing, in the middle of that verse, verse 9, where it says that when he descended, he descended into the lower parts of the earth. And most scholars believe that's kind of interpreted this lower parts of the earth to be a reference to Hades, even more specifically to hell, seeming to indicate that after his death that we talk about on Good Friday and his resurrection that we talk about on Easter, Jesus went to hell. which, if you grew up in certain contexts, is not something maybe you think much about. But quite frankly, it sounds kind of weird to me, at least it did some years ago, because it's not something I grew up hearing a lot about. Quite frankly, I grew up in a really good church, but we didn't talk about this. We talked about the crucifixion and the price Jesus paid on the cross, and we talked about the resurrection, but this kind of place in the middle, not a lot about it. And so when I think about Easter, I don't think a lot about this idea that Jesus, after he died, before he rose, descended into hell. But if it's true that after he died, but before he raised, he in some way, for some purpose, actually did go to hell, then it kind of makes me wonder about some things. It makes me wonder if there was more than the things we could physically see going on. It makes me wonder if there was more to the things that he actually suffered, to the price that he actually paid more than the things that we are able to see with physical eyes. It raises for me some questions. So I start to think about this idea, not just the cross and not just the resurrection, but this place in between. And among the questions I have are these. If he did indeed descend into the lower parts, and that really is hell, what did he do when he went there? And more, why did he go in the first place if he did indeed go there? Is there more going on than what can be seen with physical eyes? Well, as it turns out, while there's a lot we don't know about that kind of period of time between his death and his resurrection, and a lot we can't know, quite frankly, because we weren't there and we can't see, in spite of that, there actually are a number of places in Scripture that actually do speak to this, providing snippets of information, little glimpses of revelation that help us to get a glimpse, to help us to see what only Jesus actually saw and experienced himself. And among the most familiar, little snippets or glimpses of this, at least it is to us familiar here at Open Door, because quite frankly, we can roll this one out just about every single Easter. It's found in 1 Peter 3.19, where it says this, that when Jesus died, still being alive in his spirit. According to 1 Peter 3.18, he descended alive in his spirit. He descended into the lower parts. He went to hell in order to, according to 1 Peter 3.19, do something, to make a proclamation to the spirits now in prison. And in my mind's eye, as I've told you this in the past, I see that happening, that transpiring something like this. That at the end of his time, in what Ephesians 4 calls the lower parts of the earth, or at the end of his time in hell, if you will, just prior to his resurrection. Indeed, I believe it was kind of just as the resurrection event is beginning, Jesus is rising up, and as he rises up, indeed, it's as he is beginning his ascent, having already descended, he makes this proclamation. Remember what it is?
