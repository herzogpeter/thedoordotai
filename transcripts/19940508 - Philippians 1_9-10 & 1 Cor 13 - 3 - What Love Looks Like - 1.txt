Open your Bibles with me this morning to the book of Philippians, chapter 1, picking our study up in verse 9, Philippians chapter 1, verse 9. I'd like to pray as we begin. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. I pray this morning, Jesus, in your name, that you would, by the power of your Spirit, be in the Word. I pray, Jesus, that you would incarnate yourself in the word. Be the Logos, the Rhema of God, this morning. In Jesus' name, amen. Sheldon Van Auken, in his book, A Severe Mercy, a book that is a compilation of letters between himself and C.S. Lewis, wrote to C.S. Lewis these words in reflecting on his search for truth that ultimately brought him life in Christ. I quote, The strongest argument I have found yet for Christianity is Christians. Their love most of all, their joy as well, their certainty of things to come. The strongest argument yet I have found against Christianity is also Christians. When they are somber and joyless, when they are self-righteous and smug in complacent consecration, when they are narrow and repressive, when they are lacking love, then in my mind and in my search, Christianity dies a thousand deaths. Jesus dealt with that same kind of thing, but taking a little bit different track, he said this of that, By this shall all men know, not that Christianity is real, by this shall all men know that you, in fact, are my disciples, if you have love one for another. Love finding itself in a place of high priority. During these weeks, in our study of Philippians chapter 1, and dwelling for some time now in verse 9 through 11, we're dealing with a prayer. by the Apostle Paul on behalf of some people that he dearly loved that powerfully reflects this priority of love. Beginning in verse 9, And this I pray, this I pray first of all, that your love for one another, I think you can insert there, but that your love in general would abound still more and more. And then he qualifies it. Maybe it's better to say he clarifies it. What I mean by that is not a naive, blind, gullible love, but I want a love, I'm praying that a love would abound in you more and more that is in real knowledge of at least two things. That it would be abounding in real knowledge of what love is, first of all, some deep understandings of what it is, and second of all, that your love would be abounding in real knowledge and all discernment of what people are like, and what their failings are like, and how they can disappoint you, and how they can hurt you, and even in real knowledge of what love is and what people are like, that your love even then would abound still more and more. The fact is this, that among the Philippians, there was already a very tangible, invisible expression of and experience of love. In our introductory sermons relative to Philippians, we found that in an unusual way, Paul had an affinity for these people, a very special relationship, and they were, in demonstrated ways, a loving people of whom it could be said, I think, abounded in love already. But Paul here is saying, I'm calling you further. I would like you to go deeper. I would like you to extend yourself higher, abounding more, abounding and more. I kind of hear it this way. Paul's saying to them, Open your hearts, Philippi, To the possibility that wherever you are in your understanding of and your capacity to love. Now get that. They might all be as individuals in different places of understanding love and their capacity to. Some understanding this much. Others this much. Others this much. Some having a capacity for this much. Others this much. Wherever you are, open your heart to the possibility that there's more. And after you discover that there's more and that you even have capacity for more. Understand this. Open your heart to this. There's more. I would say the same thing to us, Church of the Open Door. As we continue in this study, open your heart to the possibility that wherever you are in your understanding of love and your capacity to love, and admittedly, we are all in different places, some this much, some this much, some this much. Wherever you are, open your heart to the possibility that there's more. And when you understand there's more to understanding love and more to your capacity to love than you knew. Understand this, there's more after that. And this I pray that your love may abound. The question I promised you as it relates to this that we would have to get to would be this question, however. What is love? that we are supposed to abound in. Paul here prays for it. We are supposed to do it more. We are supposed to abound in it. In verse 10 it says, I pray this love would abound so that you would approve the things which are excellent. And we defined last time that what is the excellent thing is in fact the love that is to abound. And I pray that you would be able to discern that and choose that. So we're supposed to discern love and choose love. Not only that, in real knowledge of what love is, We're supposed to choose it and discern it and abound in it and do it. So what is it? And not just generally what is it, but I want to know, just for me specifically, I want to know specifically, Paul, what kind of love were you praying would abound? What did you have in your mind, Paul, when you wrote these words? And this I pray that your love, what kind of love were you praying would abound? for the fact is this there are different kinds of love and while on the front end that might strike you a bit odd if you think a little bit further of course there are different kinds of love and different levels of its expression for instance I love my wife and when I think of my love for my wife I can stir things in my spirit and see things in my mind relative to my love for my wife that are exclusive to that relationship. I love my wife. Ich lube spaghetti. But it's what? It's different. There are different kinds of love. Ich lube my children. Ich lube my children more than ich lube andere children. Und ich lube children. Aber ich lube meine children. Und ich lube meine children differently than ich lube meine wife. Und ich lube meine wife. Aber es ist anders. Es gibt die parts und components von meinem relationship mit meinem wife that sind nicht part of mein relationship mit meinem children. Part of my relationship with my children. Components there that are not part of this relationship. It's different. It's all love. It's all love. I love my dog. I like my dog. I love my car. No, I don't. I'm far too spiritual for that. I like my car. Just like it. Kind of like it. I love vacations. I loved my vacation. Love to fish. there's different kinds of love there is romantic love intoxicating and powerful so intoxicating and powerful is romantic love that it has the power to make wise and prudent people act really stupid one of the most exhilarating things any of us will ever experience is romantic love being born along by that amount of control. One of the most painful things some of us will ever experience in our whole lives is that same thing, romantic love. Sick with love. That's a real thing. That is a real thing. It's a wonderful thing. But there are different kinds of love. There is a committed love. And even as I say that word, I feel steel come into my spirit. That doesn't diminish the value and glory of romantic love, but it's a different kind of love, is committed love. There is a committed love that sticks around, that doesn't leave when the bloom is off the rose of romance. There is a love that sticks around. Two weeks ago I was speaking at a conference in New Mexico, and as I just kind of reflected of the people, There was one young couple there, couldn't have been older than their mid-20s, and she was in a wheelchair. Came to hear the story of the fact that one year ago at that very same conference, she had fallen ill with a disease that they still hadn't been able to identify, but her body was deteriorating and deteriorating, and now she was in a wheelchair, and I just watched them. I had a chance to talk to them, but I just watched them, And what I was moved by and affected by was how he served her. There is a love that serves people. There is a love that sticks around, that stays, that doesn't leave when the bloom is off the rose of romance. And I thought of all the people here I know just like that who demonstrate that kind of love. There's different kinds of love. There is a love that's marked by courage. There is a love that opposes evil. And I get an entirely different picture of that. But there is a love that stands up against that which is evil and that which is wrong and that which is destroying people's lives. There is a love that stands against. There is a love that tells the truth no matter what the cost. And sometimes people tell the truth because then they win and then they get to hurt. And there are people who tell the truth because it is the loving thing to do even though the truth might hurt. There is a love that tells the truth. there is a love that brings consequences to bear upon a person that you love there are people who bring consequences to bear because we love to give the consequences because we love to feel the power but there is a love that allows consequences there is a love that looks at a child and looks at a son and says son what you just did was wrong there is a love that intervenes and says stop that now there is a love that breaks the silence on hidden sin there is a hate that could break the silence on hidden sin I would like if I hated you wanted to humiliate you to expose you to everyone to humiliate there is a love that would deal with sin that would would break the silence. There is a love that says, no, not anymore. There is a love that to a sweetheart would say, what we're doing is wrong and we're going to stop. And we're not going to stop because we don't love one another. We're going to stop doing this because we do love one another. There is a love that says, no more. there is a love that serves there is a shade of love that gives and holds there is a love that comes around there is a love that affirms there is a love that builds up you've been around that kind of love you've been around a person who just loves and you feel built there is a love that encourages there is a love that looks at a 12 year old boy and says good job way to go Way to go, you did good. There is a love that lays down its life. For greater love has no man than this, but that he give his life for a friend. There is a love that forgives. How could we possibly talk about, as we are these weeks now, grappling with what it means to love and what love looks like. How could we possibly talk about the possibility of love without at some point talking about forgiveness? For the fact is this, forgiveness enables love. It makes love possible to exist and then to grow. Think on this, what relationship in this room right now would be if it were not for somewhere forgiveness? Dan Allender in his book Bold Love states as the premise of the book this We will not live with purpose or joy unless we love We will not love unless we forgive And we will not forgive unless our hatred is continually melted By the searing truth of the grace of the gospel End quote But what is forgiveness? And how do I do forgiveness? Even knowing forgiveness is what releases love. How do I do forgiveness if the behavior in the person I'm trying to deal with never changes? Does forgive mean don't hold people accountable? Does forgive mean there are no consequences? And all of a sudden I understand that my understanding of love can be twisted. My understanding of forgiveness can be twisted. And if either one of them get twisted, I'll never move into love. giving you all of these snapshots what I want to do as we begin this is have you enter into the struggle that we are going to have and we do have with understanding and having any attempt to define what love is for the fact is this the definition of love is not static there is no place we can go and say there it is, that is it, right there if you do identify something as love it will indeed be love I would imagine but it will be a shade of it an expression of it the fact is this love has nuances and shades and different applications in different contexts and life is very confusing and so is love and this loving thing is not for the faint of heart you are going to have to be engaged and think and struggle. What does it mean? How does it look? How would it look here? How would it look there? For some, love is but a warm and gooey feeling, saccharine sweet, and ironically, it is that. If love were not warm and gooey and saccharine sweet, we would not desire it as much as we do. It's one of the reasons we love it. It is that. Let that be one of the shades. But if it's the only shade you know, if it's the only shade you think love has, then your definition of love, being warm and gooey, will literally in your life be an enemy to love. And warm and gooey will in application and in reality end up draining away resolve from time to time. To in certain situations do the most loving thing. For sometimes the most loving thing in a family or in a church in a relationship is to say no. Stop. That's wrong. Here's the consequence. and let me tell you this even as I say those words I know that no can be said with no love stop can be said here's a consequence can be done with evil intent even beginning to grapple with what it means to love is not for the faint of heart and there are ways in which we'll never get there Jesus picking up a child placing this child on his knee looked then at the multitude and said suffer the little children to come unto me I receive the children I love the children and that scene in my mind is painted with pastel colors soft of hue and warm in feeling. Warm and gooey is that feeling. And by warm and gooey I do not mean unimportant and without power. Warm and gooey is great. It is part of love. Let the little children come. I feel then what I think love should feel like all the time. That's what love looks like. Let the children come. That same Jesus said to Peter who denied him three times, expecting probably, undoubtedly, to be eliminated from service, Peter, feed my sheep. Peter, grace to you. That's what love looks like. And there it is again, what I think it ought to always look like. And to disciples who were arrogant, arguing amongst themselves who would be the greatest, He stooped to them to serve their need and washed their feet. And that's what love looks like. And that's what it always looks like. But that same Jesus, that same Jesus who in love did and said those things, in love did and said these things, O you of little faith, O unbelieving generation and perverted generation, he said that to his disciples. It's not warm and gooey, but is it love? Well, it depends on how you view love, how you define love. So this business of defining love is, this is what it is. It's going to take some work and some fighting and some wrestling in our minds. Among the most loving things that Jesus ever did, I believe it could be argued, is seen in Matthew 23, where in the courtyard of the Gentiles, he stood against the religious system of the day that was shutting people out of the kingdom and exposed the falseness of their theology and the hypocrisy of their lifestyle and said, these are those who put heavy weights on the shoulders of men and women, do nothing to lift that load off, do nothing to extend a strong arm of grace. you are whited walls he said to them full of dead men's bones you polish the outside of the cup inwardly you're full of robbery and self-indulgence you're a brood of vipers and in our minds we reel we are grateful for the fact that he fought for those who were being shut out of the kingdom and maybe that's where we see love being expressed but certainly this wasn't love for the Pharisees I want you to consider the possibility that his words to the Pharisees was an example of supreme love. A confrontation upon them that he knew when he says this out loud, they will kill me for this. A confrontation he also knew would be their only possible hope of ever seeing their sin for no one ever had the courage to tell them the truth before. a confrontation he knew they would kill him for a confrontation he knew was their only hope to see their sin to repent of their sin therefore entering into life if they would see their sin and repent of their sin put all that together I'm back to my original question so what kind of love is it that Paul is praying would abound in them. Which shade? All of them? One of them? Warm and gooey feelings? Sentimental sweetness? If it were that, it's this. And this I pray that your warm and gooey feelings would abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment. I think we know that while warm and gooey feelings I think would be a wonderful thing and worthy of prayer and part of the prayer for love Paul is praying for it's not as if he's not praying for that that he is praying for that he's praying for more than that we have some help in discerning the kind of love he's praying for from at least two places the first place we're going to find some help is where we're going to look today and that is into the specific word in the text, the word love it is the word agape, we're going to work at that we're going to look at that and define it the second place we're going to find some help is in 1 Corinthians 13 where the same writer, that is Paul, who wrote Philippians 1.9 uses the very same word he uses in Philippians 1.9 in 1 Corinthians 13 but in 1 Corinthians 13 he takes that word and he spreads it out on a canvas showing us the shades of love. Love is patient, but it's not just patient. It's kind, but it's not just kind. It's not jealous. And on we go seeing the shades of love over the next couple of weeks. And like a picture, we watch under that fluid begin to develop. It comes into clearer and clearer focus what love really is and what love really is. But know this. even as I speak of that picture coming clearer and clearer as we get deeper into the study, after we are done with the study and maybe we do see some things a little more clearly, know this, that your understanding of love and your experience of love will still be seen and experienced through a glass darkly. Something else I want you to know as it relates to the work we're going to do around this topic. that in these two places, first of all, in defining agape in verse 9 and then in 1 Corinthians 13, in both of those places, I want to do two things. I want to ask two questions in both those places. The first is, what does it mean? What does agape mean today? Next week, what does patience mean? What does kindness mean? What does it look like that you're not jealous? What do those things look like? The second thing I want to ask, though, is this, how do I do that? How do I enter into an experience of that, even a little bit? So for several weeks, as we go through this, I'm going to do two things. Define the concept. Number two, ask the question, how do we do that? Let's begin today, as if we haven't begun. Let's define the word. What does it mean, agape? It's a word I'm going to assume that many of you have heard before, maybe more than you care. This is going to feel redundant. I hope it doesn't. I'm going to assume also that some of you haven't. To do that well, that is to define agape well, I think we need to see it in contrast to at least two other Greek words for love. There are four Greek words for love in all. Eros, phileo, storge, and agape. Three of them are used in Scripture. Those are the three I'll deal with. Eros speaks to what it sounds like. Eros, erotic. It is sexual love. This kind of love is valid, good, blessed by God, created by God, but it is not the love Paul is praying would abound in them. second greek word found often in scripture more often than eros is the greek word phileo love again i assume that you've had some understanding of what this is it is brotherly love and if you would allow anything to stir in yourself it's a warm thing it's an affectionate love philanthropic love friendship primary characteristic of phileo that i'd like you to have in terms of teaching here as it is distinguished from agape is that phileo love is built on and it feeds off of mutuality. In other words, the reason I am friends with the people I am friends with, the people I like, the people that I like are people that I like because, one, I like them, Two, they like me. That's how it works. I don't hang around a lot of people for very long who when I meet them go, it's mutual. Tendency of phileo love is that it, especially on the front end, escalates very rapidly. It can also de-escalate very rapidly. It works like this. I like you. I like you too. I like you a lot. I like you a lot too I like you like a real lot I'm flying I like you a real lot too we're in love this is great except for like there's one thing I don't like what? what? all of a sudden as fast as it escalates it can de-escalate now when I describe phileo that love it sounds shallow and superficial I want to put something in your mind around phileo that would affirm forever that though that is an aspect of phileo, it is not a shallow, superficial love. In fact, the most intimate relationships and most exhilarating, fulfilling relationships you have right now are characterized powerfully by phileo. In any friendship that is marked by intimacy, it is marked by this. I give myself to you. You open yourself to me. You give yourself to me. I open myself to you. It's called intimacy. And you want to know something? For most of us, there are very few people that you enter into that kind of full opening and full entering with. Phileo love is something you experience wonderfully. With some of your best friends. Your most trusted friends. they are your garden friends Jesus loved the multitude he felt compassion for them it was genuine, it was real it was from God, it was God and then he had twelve they had a different relationship of the twelve there were three of the three it says that there was one disciple that Jesus loved it doesn't mean he didn't love the others it doesn't mean he didn't love the multitude there was one, his name was John the word for love there was philel love. It's a powerful love. It's a godly love. It is not a shallow thing. 1 Peter 3.8, Romans 12.18, 1 Thessalonians 4.9, Hebrews 13.1, 1 Peter 1.22, speak of a sincere love of the brethren and calls for loving one another. That is back and forth, me loving you. Yes, you loving me. Back and forth from the heart to be spread out beyond the one, the three, the twelve. That phileo love spreads. Fervent love from the heart. I'm establishing that phileo love is a high value. A powerful virtue. Not a shallow thing. 1 Corinthians 16, 22 speaks of us loving Jesus with phileo. There are other passages that call us to love God with agape love, but there are passages that call for us or describe us loving Jesus. Phileo love, warmth, tenderness, fervency. John 16, 27, Daniel 1, 9 speaks of God loving me that way, God loving you that way with phileo, friendly, brotherly, tenderly, fervently. but it's not the word Paul uses in chapter 1, verse 9. The word he uses is agape. And as I say that, I want to clarify something that I think is extremely important that we have in our minds, clearly. Agape love includes all of the aspects of phileo, save one. The difference between agape love and phileo love is not that phileo love is warm and tender and gooey, and agape isn't. Agape love, one difference is this. It is not dependent on mutuality for it to exist. It does not depend on it coming back for me to extend it. Therefore, if you were to, in your mind, try to understand phileo love and agape love, You don't have phileo over here. And I say, that wasn't what he was praying for. He was praying for agape, which is different. Put phileo over here. Make a circle. That's phileo. Put a broader circle around phileo. That's agape. Within agape is phileo. Agape is more. Agape includes more people. Agape would include people who don't necessarily give it back. And this I pray, that your circle get bigger. Agape at the core is defined as a sacrificial love. It is a love that acts in the best interest of the person you are loving. It is a love that does things that is the best, does a thing that is the best for him or her, regardless of or without the promise of that activity or that movement towards you being received or appreciated. And by the way, as I say that, that allows me to understand agape love as being part of and maybe being exactly what Jesus did when he was in the courtyard of the Gentiles and told the truth about a whited wall and about a brood of vipers because at that particular moment in the life of the Pharisees, what in fact was the best thing in their best interest to hear and to know was about their sin. The standing and doing that was an expression of love, knowing that they might not understand. They might not reciprocate. They might not receive it. agape love is a love extended without promise of return without promise of relationship it is known universally as the supreme love it is the love that God has for the world John 3 16 says for God so loved the world that he gave his only son and he gave his only son without the promise that we would respond he gave his only son before he knew that we would say, thank you, Jesus. We receive your gift. We receive your life and light and grace. Before he knew we would do that, he acted. Agape love, add this to your understanding of what agape is relative to that. Agape makes the first move. Agape gave his son before we cared, made the first move. I think the best verse to illustrate that is Romans 5, 7 and eight. One would hardly die for a righteous man. Though for a good man, someone would dare even to die. But God demonstrated His love toward us, His agape toward us, in that while we were still sinners, while we were still rejecting, reviling, turning our back on and ignoring Him, while we were still doing that, He died for us. He made the sacrifice. what that means is this before I ever moved toward him he moved toward me before we ever responded to him he responded to us before we ever loved him he loved us and what that means about agape love is this again whatever else you understand agape love to mean or do it means this and it does this. Agape love makes the first move. And with that in mind, as I think of what that would look like in my life or anyone's life, I enter into the fact that not only is agape love sacrificial in some general way, it is enormously risky. What's the risk? The risk is this. If I move toward you first, As God moved toward us first, the enormous risk is this. You won't care. You won't respond. You won't hear. It won't matter. And I will take this incredible risk and do this incredibly hard thing for nothing. Know this, that's exactly what Jesus did. That's exactly the risk he took. I have to make things human. I have to put them in human terms to understand them at all. And so with that in mind, I want you to forgive me for a picture I have in my mind that I'm sure didn't happen. But it helps me enter into this picture. I have a picture of the Godhead in eternity past having this conversation that is bizarre. Considering humanity upon whom we have set our love. In order to have relationship back, we're going to have to make the first move. Not only won't they make the first move, there's nothing they could do that would bridge the chasm. So there's nothing they could do anyway. We have to make the first move. And then this bizarre conversation ensues in this crazy mind of mine. And the conversation is this, oh, but what if it doesn't work? What if they don't respond? Do you have any idea the risk you're taking to pour out your life for them and their back is to you? They may never turn around. God, we are putting our guard down for them. We are opening ourselves up to them, and they may never come back. And again, in this conversation, it could not have happened the way I'm saying it. Somewhere in the Godhead, in eternity past, the decision was made. The decision was this. It's worth the risk. even if they reject it we are going to give it I am going to give it and God acted first come back to Philippians 1.9 and this I pray that your agape would abound still more and more that more and more you would become a people who aren't waiting for everybody else to act that you would become a people more and more who would make the first step without the promise of return, without the promise of relationship, without the promise of reception. We are so scared of one another, aren't we? You know, in some of our ministry times afterwards, we've gone over that and prayed and talked over that. that we really are scared of each other because we have been wounded and we have been hurt. And we have our guard up, and for good reason. And sometimes I get this picture of us, not just us particularly open door, but people. It's like we're all waiting for, we all want this ache in our heart to enter in, to enter in, and we're all waiting for somebody else, oh, make the first move. I pray, this I pray, that more and more you'd be a people who you would be the one who would make the first move. and I think of that just think of that with me spreading through a church where the ripple effect of people who began to be empowered by the spirit and make the choice to say I'm going to allow that I'm going to enter into that and make the first move this kind of love will cost you more than anything on earth ever has. Because for some of you, in the context within which you may be called to love like this and make the first step, it might mean lowering your guard before the other person does. And to lower your guard before they do is not only a sacrificial thing, it's an enormously risky thing. You want to know something as, I don't know how this is sounding to you, but it occurs to me that it might sound just impossible. It just can't be done. I just can't do it. Do you know what? Do you want to know something? I think more than you even know, you've already experienced this. I'm going to make an assumption that at some level, and at some point, one time, you did make the first move. That you have something in the log of your experience where you made the first move. If you ever have made the first move without a promise that it would be returned, you have, even if it's a small way, you have entered into the wonder and the glory and the sheer terror of agape love. And I pray, I pray that more and more and more, says Paul, you would enter into that terror and that wonder and that glory. But I'll be rejected. You will probably be rejected. I see God in the Godhead again. I see it and they will. Thousands have not turned their back. have not come around, have continued to turn their back. The risk he took for thousands did not pay off. But you know what? I'm standing here, and many of you, most of you are in Christ, and I get to stand here and say to God, God, for me and on behalf of everyone here who names your name as the most precious name, we want to tell you it was worth the risk. We also want to tell you the reason we love you is because you took the first move. You made the first move, and we are really grateful you did it. You showed us how to do it. Empower us now to be people who make the first move. Who make the first move. cost us more than anything on earth will ever cost us. Because sometimes it will be the bringing of a consequence. Because sometimes it will mean the exposing of a sin. Because sometimes it will mean standing against and saying no. Sometimes it will mean bringing a cup of cold water in Jesus' name. Sometimes it will be wonderfully, gloriously simple. Cup of cold water. Other times there will be this sense, I have got to be as wise as a serpent, harmless as a dove. Wisdom beyond my capacity to love in this evil situation. But beloved, as well as being a kind of love that will cost you more than anything on earth ever has, this kind of love will bring you closer to the heart of God than anything on earth ever could. because this kind of love is the heart of God. Because this kind of love is God. Second question, where does this kind of love come from? How do I do it? What is the source? Well, the fact is this, and some of you may be ahead of me already. You've probably already even heard it in my speech here this morning. There is no way that love like this can come from any other source than God. and that is why Paul prayed that this love would abound because it's going to require supernatural empowerment a supernatural source Galatians 5 says this but I say this walk by means of the spirit in you and you will number one not fulfill the lust of the flesh if you walk by the spirit and the fruit of the spirit the result of walking by the spirit is first of all love so this love is going to be a work of the Spirit. It is a supernatural thing. It is Christ alive in you. It is Holy Spirit-empowered work. We have said that over and over again. And I say it again today. Walk by the Spirit by means of supernatural empowerment. But let me clarify something as well. Hear this as well. That walking by the Spirit does not mean, and being empowered by the Spirit does not mean we are in this passive. That we are in this uninvolved bystanders as if God magically sprinkles love dust on us even against our will. I don't want to love. I'm not going to love. I don't care about love. But he said love, so if it's the Spirit, he's just going to have, whoa, there I go loving. walk by the spirit it's the only way you're ever going to love fruit of the spirit is love you know it's interesting the same Paul that wrote those words same Paul that wrote Philippians 1.9 same Paul that wrote 1 Corinthians 13 which is going to have a list of attributes of love and by the way the fruit of the spirit love, joy, peace guess what? it's the same list almost as 1 Corinthians 13 love is go look at Galatians 5 he also wrote however Colossians 3 verse 12 hear these words put it in the pot of our understanding and how it is these things are experienced and lived out and so Paul says as though those who have already been chosen of God that's who you are holy and beloved that's who you are you are people who already have in them Jesus by his spirit now residing by that very presence in you, the incarnate one in you, by that very power in you, here's the words, put on you, put on compassion, put on kindness, put on humility, put on gentleness, put on patience, bearing with one another, forgiving one another. Later it will say putting aside or putting off evil. and the list goes on and it's interesting because the list is the same as in Galatians 5 walk by the spirit and you won't put and you won't do the lust of the flesh in Galatians 3 he says put off the lust you put it off and beyond all these things put on love I don't know if this is the best way to see it but I literally I see it like a coat it's like put on the coat of love. You'll wear it well. This coat is made for you. It will feel awkward from time to time. But Colossians 3, if you're going to enter into this, you're going to have to wear it. You're going to have to put it on, whatever that means. You're going to have to receive it. You're going to have to desire it. You're going to have to step into it. You're going to have to move your hand and move your heart. You're going to have to believe it and you're going to have to pray for it. in this I pray we say yes to this kind of love putting those two things by the way this dynamic of us putting it on but being empowered by the spirit this mystical marvelous union between my needing to move and his empowering me to move is seen later in Philippians 2.12. I'm so delighted that we're going to come to that. Philippians 2.12 says, work out your salvation with fear and trembling. You've heard that verse. Kind of scary verse. It's you do that. Work it out with fear and trembling. Flesh it out. Live it out. Next verse, however, says this. For it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. Do it. You can't do it without the empowerment of God to do it, but you do do it. You do wear it. You do put it on. You do receive it. You do say yes to it. And if you do say no to it, you won't get it. I would say it like this. Lord Jesus, when I look at this kind of love beyond me and beyond us, I pray that you empower me and you empower us to put it on and to put some things off, but put them off. I must, but I couldn't. Empower me to do it. You have one without the other. You have nothing. next week we are going to hear shades of love love is patient love is kind love is not jealous and somewhere in the teaching as I come to how do we do this I'm going to say these words put on patience put it on put on kindness love is not jealous put off jealousy and as you even attempt to begin to put that on and try to wear that thing there's something going to rise in you that says I don't know if I can well you can't do it move toward it get your nose in it put it on and the whole time understand that if there is not an empowerment a filling a walking by means of the spirit you can't wear this coat but put it on and put it off and walk by the Spirit sometimes we need to see concepts in a different context in a different way and I would bet that as I share this little story of mine with you that there will be places in your life where you will have seen already this dynamic of me having to move but it being empowered by the Spirit at the same time. Two years ago, and this came to my mind when I was doing this, and it's one of the places I've seen it most graphically. Two years ago, we as a church went through a crisis, but I went through one too, and I've shared many of the aspects of that with you already. One of the things I went through, and whether I said this out loud or not, I think it would be safe on your part to assume that I was struggling with this, was personally whether I would ever be in ministry again. I really struggled with that. And people who are friends of mine were part of my struggle and my sharing. And the other part was not just ministry in general, but quite whether I would be here. Whether I could come back to and wear the mantle, if you will, the coat, if you will, of whatever it feels like to do this here in this place. And as I was going through that time away from here, in the place I was at, exhausted and whatever else it was, I was in this wrestling match with God. And the wrestling match was this, God, if you want me to go back into ministry, and if you want me to do that, and if you want me to do it there, I want to know that you're going to empower me to do that. I want to know that I am going to have the anointing of your spirit that I've had in the years previous, I think, to do what I had to do. I want to know before I go that I'll have it. And I was just fighting with God. In fact, I didn't tell. I told God at one point I wanted a burning bush. You know, he did this Moses thing, and this is grandiose, but you talk to him real strong before he ever went. Give me a burning bush. We got hit by lightning. Anyway, I got to be real careful about that. Anyway, here's my struggle. You've had this struggle. I kept waiting for this feeling to come. I kept waiting for this assurance to kind of soothe over me like an ointment that said, you are now full. You are now ready. You have all sorts of new information and new insights. You are now ready to go. And I would, I'm back. I'm back. Remember how I came back? In the process I had in fighting through that whole thing, I remember I came to some understanding of this kind of dynamic. God didn't say these things in words to me, but through the counsel of friends, my own fight, my own prayer, wrestling with God. It was as if I heard God say to me, as I said to him, God, can I wear that coat? Can I do that thing? He said to me, do you want to? Do you want to? More, will you? Will you put it on? Will you walk up those steps? Even if you don't feel full, even if you don't feel like there's a new insight, will you walk up the steps? Will you do it? now I'm here so I obviously said yes but somewhere along the line in my interchange there I learned something that I wasn't always going to get the warm and gooey feeling before I made the move that I had to take the step that I had to say okay I don't feel like I can I don't feel like I can love like this it feels so beyond me but I'll wear that and I will put off that and I will however I don't even know how to do will you help me and as there was the obedience there came with it before it after it I don't know I don't know it was there sometimes I didn't feel it and this I pray that your love may abound how's that going to happen put on love how am I going to put it on? walk by the spirit you will be empowered by the spirit we are called beloved to a lifestyle that is beyond us it is beyond us and so we call in the spirit but that does not mean we are passive in it we say yes to it we put it on we put it off love is patient love is kind put it on love is not jealous put it off and walk by the spirit would you stand with me as we close describe this word about love that God is giving to us these weeks a couple of weeks ago as an egg remember that with like an egg, all the potential of life if it's left to run its course. And the word was, don't rush this, but don't crush this. Just allow this to keep on growing and keep on working and keep on doing in you and through you what God would have be done in you and through you. I would like to pray together right now for a kind of consecration around this, that we stay in this. thing, that we stay in this thing. Pray for one another. God be loved, that we be a people more and more taking the first step. Oh, it's so scary. You will be rejected, but you will find some who come back. Jesus, let's just pray together. Jesus, I thank you for your word. I thank you that you embody your word. That you are here in your word, active and alive and moving. And you are in us, stirring things. Some of it's confusing. Some of it's scary. But it has the smell to many of us of life. This feels like life. There's something right here. Jesus, in this church, we pray. In your spirit, if you can do this, pray this with me again. We, this, we pray. that our love may abound still more and more. And yes, Lord, in real knowledge of what love is and what it could cost, we put it on. Empower us by your spirit to live it out, to put it on, to wear the coat. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen
