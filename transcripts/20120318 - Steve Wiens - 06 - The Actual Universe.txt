Well, open your Bibles, if you have them, to Colossians chapter 3. If you have an electronic device that works a little better for you, that's fine. If you want to just look it up, look at it up on the screens, that's fine too. But I want to read it to you, this text that we've been in for many, many weeks now, and there's just more there. So Colossians 3, 17 through 24, we read this. And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them. Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, and do it not only when there are eyes on you to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. And whatever you do, work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you'll receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. Because it is the Lord Christ that you're serving. So we've been all over the map with this thing. We looked at men and women and husbands and wives and love and submission for a number of weeks. And then we moved into this three-week series on deliverance. Because when you walk into issues of marriage and pain and gender issues, you realize that there's stuff that only the power of God can deliver you from. There's pain that exists that only the power of God can set you free from. So we looked at that for a while. And then Dave and Jen jumped into this idea of someone's got to go first. That when it comes to relationships and loving and submitting, someone's got to go first. Someone has to be the one to sort of say, I'm going to be the one to go first. And I thought that little two-week thing was sweet. And what I want to do today, this morning, is in the spirit of expository preaching, where we go verse by verse and line by line, I want to focus on one word is all I'm going to focus on today. One word. So take that, Dave Johnson. I don't even think you could do better than that. The word I want to look at in this text is the word your. So like your actual wife. your actual husband, your actual child, your actual parent, your actual boss, your actual best friend who actually exists in the actual universe. This isn't a concept to think is interesting, and it's certainly not the ideal person that you're called to love and submit to. You know the difference between your ideal spouse and your actual spouse? The difference between your ideal roommate and your actual roommate? The difference between your ideal child and your actual child? Your ideal parent and your actual parent? In these verses, Paul is very explicit that we are called to love or submit to or obey your actual, the actual person that actually exists in the actual universe. So the question is this, what does it mean to do that? Because I think we all are familiar with the ideal world. You wake up in the morning, and you don't even know this, but you wake up in the morning with a picture of what your ideal day is going to look like. It involves no traffic jams, no spilled coffee. It involves parents who actually listen to you. It involves children who behave. It involves co-workers who behave. Supervisors who are kind and friendly. It involves friends who go out of their way to make sure you feel secure and comfortable in your world. That's the ideal universe, right? You've never lived one day in the ideal universe. Where we live is the actual universe, and you're married to an actual person who actually exists in the actual world. Amen? Well, here's the deal. We generally prefer the airbrushed version in ourselves and in others. So it's time for a mass confession. It's going to feel uncomfortable, but we're going to do it anyway. I want you to raise your right hand and confess this sin. I prefer the airbrushed version of myself and those I love. All right, you're absolved of that sin. No, it's good to say out loud. Now, this is what I mean by this. I was over at Dave's house. This was several years ago, and we were sitting. It was summertime. We were sitting under his deck. He's got a little patio down there, and he sits in a seat where he can look at you, but also through his sliding glass doors, look at his TV where the Cubs game is usually playing. Am I right, Greg? You know I'm right. And so I was in the middle of telling him this story that was pretty poignant and pretty tender. I mean, I was kind of pouring it out to him, showing up, being honest, talking. And right before I said the most poignant thing, he goes, yes, Cubs win! and I'm like are you kidding me so I said Dave I was right in the middle of telling you something really serious I mean this was a big deal for me and you're watching the Cubs and he goes you get the whole package now does he probably need to work on his listening probably but what he said was really true like we expect someone to be this boisterous energetic out loud great visionary leader as well as being like a therapist that will sit with you and oh yes um say more about that you know and the actual person who actually exists in the actual universe is a person that will never live up to your ideal. The actual person who actually exists in the actual universe is a person who will never live up to your ideal. Now, why do we think this way? Why do we generally prefer the airbrushed version of ourself and others? I think it's because of this dirty little word that is called shame. Now, I want to contrast shame with guilt. Guilt is, I made a mistake, and I need to fix it. Guilt is, I made a mistake. I did a wrong thing. I didn't listen to my friend as he was telling a very poignant story. Wait for it. Shame is, I'm a terrible person. I am a mistake. And nothing I can do will ever rectify that. And so I'm going to present to you a false self in the hopes that that will be a buffer between you and the actual person that actually exists in the actual universe that's living inside myself. Shame says the only way I will survive is if I put up a front. Thomas Merton wrote this about the false self. He wrote this, every one of us is shadowed by an illusory person, a false self. Illusory means dependent on an illusion. dependent on an illusion. This is the man I want myself to be, but who cannot exist, the ideal person, we would call it, because God does not know anything about him. Is that a newsflash for anyone? God doesn't know your false self. God doesn't know your shadow self. God doesn't know the ideal Steve. And to be unknown by God is altogether too much privacy. My false and private self is the one who wants to exist outside the reach of God's will and God's love, outside of reality and outside of life. And such a self cannot help but be an illusion. And that is the self that we present to each other in almost every environment that you're in. The self that God does not know, the self that is an illusion, the self that is based on making yourself look a little better in someone else's eye, and usually that's, you'll change into whatever you think they will want to see in order to be accepted. And where we see this played out in very tangible, practical ways is the picture that you choose to put on your Facebook profile. Now think about it. You are very careful in the picture that you choose to put on your Facebook profile. You do not want a picture that's taken from down below, you know, so it shows like six or seven of your chins. If you have a receding hairline, a really good move is to crop it right about here, you know. It's a good move to take, to use a picture that's in the summertime, you know, so you got a little color. Maybe after you've, your diet that worked, you know, I mean, this is what we do. And have you ever noticed, we kind of tend to pick the picture that was taken about 10 years ago. They'll never know. So I thought it'd be fun to look at some Facebook pictures now of some people. Now this, our beautiful friend Joel Hanson. And I hang out with Joel a lot. He's my brother-in-law, but he's also a really good friend. And this is what Joel looks like on a day-to-day basis. Now, Joel is also a very big deal. He's a rock star, you know? So he's been on records. He's been on TV. And so he's had occasion to do the hair and makeup thing, you know, where they kind of make you up. And so this is what Joel looks like after he's done someâ€” It's amazing, right? Okay, this is my son, Elijah. Now, this was a terrible, no good, very bad day that Elijah was having. So the sensitive, caring father that I am. I took a picture of that face because I was like, man, that is classic. I want that face. I want to remember that. But he was bummed out. And he was, and this is not all of who Elijah is, but this really was the actual Elijah that actually existed on this actual morning. Still got his jammies on. He's ticked off, ticked off at me. I think he was sick. But then, one of the, actually pretty recently, he was at my friend Dan in Aaron Bennett's house, and Dan is a great photographer, and Dan took this picture of Elijah. Right, you know, and that's the universal reaction. Anytime all around the world I could show that picture, that would be the reaction. Oh. He should use that as his Facebook profile picture for the next 40 years. I mean, this is a beautiful picture. Now, I want to show you my actual Facebook profile picture that actually exists on the actual internet. And because I've had some time to think about this, this has been what I've shown for the last, you know, few weeks. But here it is. This is it. That's Ben. I'm holding my son, Ben. He's Elijah's twin. And that is honestly how I feel about 50 to 60 percent of the time. It's not socially appropriate to suck your thumb, but I probably would if I could. my sister-in-law Kathy took that great picture just kind of snapped it and it was great so we have this propensity to use this illusory self this false self this self that acts as a buffer between our real self and the whole world with the hopes that people will come to accept and love that false self but the problem is that they never get to know the actual self and so we never get to feel actual love and we never get to experience actual acceptance does that make sense and so we're in this terrible bind. But the truth is that we've been trained to do this. So here's a picture of a beautiful woman, a model. But as I found this on the internet, I just, I looked at it and then I did a little, I did a little measuring here. So can you all see that yellow arrow? So what I did was I took the yellow arrow and I just copied it and I pasted it onto a different part of the picture which I'm about to show you. So you need to know I didn't enlarge the arrow. I just copied it and pasted it. So here it is. What this means is that this picture, in this picture, her waist is the same width as her head. Now, people! everybody knows that's not a real picture right i mean that's not a real person those aren't her real dimensions everybody knows that right like that's airbrushed and contoured and shaped everyone knows that, right? The problem is no. In fact, if you do studies on women who read these magazines and look at these pictures day after day after day, there's the direct correlation between looking at these pictures and eating disorders. Because you think you're looking at an actual person who actually exists in the actual universe, but you're not. You're looking at a fake, false identity. You and I live in the actual universe. Actual people with actual problems, actual sizes, actual faces, actual pain, actual joy. And the invitation in this text is to treat each other in the actual world. Actual people, your actual wife, your actual husband, your actual child, your actual roommate, not the idealized version that you would like them to be, no matter if you prefer it that way or not. Here's Thomas Merton's quote again. Because sometimes repetition is important. Every one of us is shadowed by an illusory person, a false self. this is the man I want myself to be but who cannot exist because God does not know anything about him. And to be unknown by God is altogether too much privacy. My false and private self is the one who wants to exist outside of the reach of God's will and God's love outside of reality and outside of life. And such a self cannot help but be an illusion. And we live our lives in the ideal world with our false self acting as a buffer that exists between our actual self and the actual person that we're sitting across the table from. And to the degree that we live in that way, we'll never be known, never be accepted, never be loved. And we'll never know how to love and accept and submit to and obey someone else. so the question is how do we become the kind of people who are willing and courageous enough to deal with the actual person that actually exists in the actual universe so jesus knew how to do this jesus was a master at doing this if you read the gospels with this as your lens how did jesus see the actual person who actually existed in the actual universe when he was interacting with that Pharisee, that tax collector, that prostitute, that child, that grandfather. It's fascinating what you'll see. So in Mark 10, 17 through 22, we see such an example. And so I want to read it to you. As Jesus started on his way, this is Mark chapter 10, starting verse 17, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him, which could have been awkward, I'm not sure. But he said, good teacher, he asked, what must I do to inherit eternal life? And then Jesus said this, says this really weird thing, which if you're not really paying attention, it kind of flows right by you. But he said, why do you call me good? Jesus answered, no one is good except God alone. To which you go, what? Moving on. Jesus says, you know the commandments. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall not defraud and honor your father and mother. Now remember, the question that he asked was, what must I do to inherit eternal life? Now we know the answer to that question, right? I mean, we're Christians. We live in the church. What must I do to be saved? How do I become a Christian? We know the answer to that. Why does Jesus give this answer? All these laws and rules and commandments. I mean, that's weird and bizarre and like even like wrong, isn't it? I think Jesus was looking at the actual person who actually existed in the actual universe, and that's found in his response. And you see, remember, he was on his knees. You can see him kind of maybe straightening up at that point a little bit and maybe with some, you know, pride even saying, teacher. All those commandments I've kept since I was a little boy. I mean, I got an A in that class. I got an A in that class seven years in a row. I passed that course. In fact, I mean, I don't want to brag or anything, but not only did I follow all those commandments, but like I followed some more too. Like you didn't even list the other four. Did you notice that? He only listed a few. He didn't even less ten. I mean, I've kept more. The buffer that existed between his actual self and the rest of the world was the fact that he had kept all these commandments. So what is, how does Jesus respond to this? Well, his response is beautiful. Jesus looked at him and what? Loved him. No condemnation, no guilt, no sarcasm, no, okay, buddy, you followed all the rules, all right? I'm pretty sure you didn't, because I saw you when you were in sixth grade. Anyway, whatever. No, Jesus looked at him and loved him. He said, one thing you lack. He said, now, the interesting thing is between Jesus looked at him and loved him. In the Greek, there's no period behind that sentence. In fact, there's this little conjunction, chi, which is used when you want to connect one thought to a following thought. So when the word chi is in there, it really means because this is true, this next thing is really true. So forgive me, but this is my version of how I would translate this particular paragraph. This is the Steve Ween's version up there. Again, forgive me, but I think it is better I read this. So Jesus looked at him and compelled by the great love that he felt for this man, He simply had to tell him one thing you lack. Motivated by love, one thing you lack. And then he says, go. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and then you will have treasure in heaven. And then come follow me. And what if we made a theology out of that? What must anyone do, any person on planet Earth, to inherit eternal life? That's the answer. for every single person who has ever existed on an entire planet. That's, well, what about people who don't have anything? What do they do? So Jesus was giving advice and an invitation to an actual person who actually existed in the actual universe because he knew this was exactly what this particular person really needed to do in order to erase the buffer that existed between himself and the rest of the world. And we read his honest response, and it's kind of sad and tragic, but it's real. At this, the man's face fell. Not the thing he was expecting to hear, this A student who had gotten everything right. And he went away sad because he had great wealth. and he went away with the invitation of Jesus lingering in his ears. Would you have the courage to do what you need to do so that you can erase the buffer? Again, this go sell everything you have, that's his invitation. It might not be your invitation. It might be your invitation. But your invitation is something that will erase the buffer that exists between you, your actual self, and the people that you interact with, and God. And this is the deal. Jesus is always inviting us out of what is safe but false and into what is vulnerable but real. I believe Jesus is always inviting us out of what is safe but false the buffer and into what is vulnerable but real. So if you had this face-to-face interaction with Jesus and you asked him, Jesus, what do I need to do to encounter my actual self and erase the buffer? What would your invitation be? What is the one thing you lack? That might be something that would be good to think about. Now in the meantime, I want to give you three practices because this has to get practical. It can't just live in the theoretical. What a deep sermon. Less deep sermons more practices. More people practicing what they hear. More people saying, I gotta wrestle that baby down to the ground. I gotta do that. Here's practice number one in the art of accepting the actual person. Notice what makes you defensive and ask what it is that you need to defend. Ask what it is that's so important that you're defending. Now, I think that I have to be the ideal husband. My wife doesn't think that. She really doesn't. But on occasion, I disappoint her. And on occasion, she tells me how I disappoint her. And when she does, I get defensive. I say things like, I emptied the dishwasher. I folded the laundry. To which, you know, every wife in the room goes, Bravo, you know. Woo! Woo! Folded the laundry. Oh. Did that take five minutes? Oh, you're so great. What must I do to inherit? You know. Or maybe it's a project that you're doing, and you've done a great job on the project, and you present it to your supervisor, and he goes, oh, man, that's so great. That is awesome, incredible. I got three changes you have to make, though, and they're these three changes, and they got to make it before we go to our customer tomorrow. And you go, oh, thank you so much. I appreciate the feedback of this presentation. and be so much better because of what you did. Thank you. And then you close the door and you just go, that jerk. How dare he? What are you trying to defend there? You're trying to defend your ideal self. The one that is perfect. The one that no one knows. The one that doesn't exist. The one that God doesn't know. The one that absolutely is illusory and dependent on illusion. So what makes you defensive? And what would it look like just to go, I'm going to let that go. I'm not an ideal person. Now, that's not, you know, this is not licensed to when your spouse comes to you and says, hey, why didn't you do that? Hey, I'm the actual person that actually exists in the actual universe. Hey, you know. If anyone does that, I actually have implanted a little chip inside your, you know, that I can zap you right there, actually. So if you do that, you know, so if your spouse does that or your roommate does that, you can just say, that's a foul ball right there. So foul ball. What I am saying is, let's be honest about what we're trying to defend, which is this perfect self, ideal self, and let's let it go. I mean, let's let that go. Let it go. Imagine how much more freedom you might live in when you realize, I don't have to get it right and perfect all the time. I can just be an actual person that actually exists in the actual universe, someone who tries things and fails, and that's really okay. I mean, that would be freedom, wouldn't it? number two practice number two remember that everyone is fighting a great battle so the next time you're behind someone at a stoplight and it's turned green and you could tell they're texting or doing something they shouldn't do before you, you know, unleash all your misdirected anger on them, remember, they're fighting a great battle just like you are. If we would give each other the benefit of the doubt to say, I have no idea what you're going through right now. So before I'm going to respond, I'm going to just guess that there's more happening than I know. It's more complex than I think. It isn't as black and white as it looks. That's what we would want from others, right? So let's extend that to someone else. Someone said, I can't remember who, but if we really knew the real story of every human being, it would make us weep. So remember that everyone is fighting a great battle. And lastly, remind yourself and others what is deepest and truest. at every chance you get, remind yourself and others what is deepest and truest. Now, this is my son, Isaac. You can tell he loves the movie Cars. That is Light and McQueen, which is out in front. You can see in front of Francesco Bernoulli and Finn McMissile. Not sure who the green guy is, but Isaac would be able to tell you. And I was out of town for about a week. And then I came back in town, but then I was busy a couple nights. I hadn't really seen him much. And so I came home about 930 at night. And you know how you do sometimes when your kids are little? Like, you know, you go up to their room, and you're going to, you awake, buddy? They're not, but you awake? Because you just want to hear their voice. And so I just leaned down, and I said, Isaac, you're my boy. And he goes, and you're my dad. that's what's deepest and truest about you and the God who created you you're his girl you're his boy he's your dad game over that's it if you could remind yourself and others that as much as possible we would start to eliminate the buffer that exists between each one of us and we would start to encounter the actual person that actually exists in the actual universe. Jesus himself knew this in Mark 1 9 through 11 the time he was getting baptized. Jesus came from Nazareth and Galilee. He was being baptized by John in the Jordan and just as Jesus was coming up out of the water he saw heaven being torn open and the spirit descending on him like a dove and a voice came from heaven you are my son whom I love. With you I am well pleased. That was the identity that Jesus carried through with him every single day of his life. I am my daddy's boy. That's it. Game over. But it's not just Jesus who carries this identity. The disciple John wrote 1 John, 1 John 3.1. Now, the disciple John also wrote the gospel of John, and he referred to himself as the disciple Jesus loved. Have you ever noticed that? Have you ever read that? And it says, like, Peter was with him. Oh, and the disciple Jesus loved was with him, too. You know, like, who does that, right? You know? And I used to think it was kind of arrogant, but now I think this is the most vulnerable and beautiful thing that ever could exist. Like, I don't care. You want to make fun of me about that? I reclined my head on his chest. How many guys would do that? I don't care. I'm loved by my God. I'm loved. I'm radically loved. My only identity that I know is I'm one radically loved by God. That's who I am. And I'm going to broadcast it to the world. That's who I am. End of story. Game over. So John says that's our identity as well. See what great love the Father has lavished on us that we should be called the children of God. And that is what we are. And I could just see John editing this sentence. See what great love the Father has given us. No, that's too small. See what great love the Father has bestowed on us. No, that's too, like, you know, that's too British or something. see what great love the Father has, I don't know, lavished on us, extravagantly given to us who didn't deserve it, and then exclamation point, and that is who we are, that is what we are, and are is in the present tense. God loves you that way, not like it's not what you will be when you become the person you should be. It's not who you were, but now all the sin is marred that. It's God loves you that way in the present tense because that's the only verb tense that God knows. Present tense. Present tense. Every moment is right now. So remember, when you're getting defensive, ask yourself, What am I trying to defend and try to let it go? And also remember that everyone's fighting a great battle. And then lastly, remind each other and yourself as often as you can about what's deepest and truest, that you are a child that is lavishly loved by God. Thank you.
