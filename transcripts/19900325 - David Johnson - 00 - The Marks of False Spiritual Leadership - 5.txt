Those of you who are staying, open your Bibles to Matthew chapter 23, picking up our study in verse 16, going this morning through verse 33. Matthew 23, verse 16. If you have been with us these last several weeks, you are probably aware of the fact that We are in this chapter in the middle of a series that we kind of discovered as we came to it. And the title of the series is simply this, Marks of False Spiritual Leadership. Another way to go with that would be to call it Issues of Spiritual Abuse. I think it has been a very powerful study. I think for some it has been a very painful study where not only has the teaching that is delineated for us in this text by Jesus made us aware of ways in which we've been victimized by systems that Jesus here has confronted. But in some painful ways, we've even become aware of ways in which we have been the victimizer, the perpetrator of some of these same kinds of things. And there's been a real moving of repentance in some of your lives, a real moving of healing in some of our lives regarding these very important things. Today, as I mentioned, we're going to go from 16 to 33. It's a big chunk. Let's read the text and then begin. Woe to you blind guides who say things like this. Whoever swears by the temple, that's not a big deal. But if you swear by the gold of the temple, he is obligated. You fools and blind men. Which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold? And whoever, you also say this, whoever swears by the altar, that's no big deal. But whoever swears by the offering upon it, you're really obligated now. What we've got here is double talk. You blind men, which is more important, the offering or the altar that sacrifices? the offering. Therefore, he who swears, swears both by the altar and by everything on it. And he who swears by the temple, swears both by the temple and by him who dwells within it. Kind of confusing language here. He who swears by heaven, swears both by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it. Without understanding all the words, Jesus is saying here, don't try to con God with your double talk. Another indictment, verse 23, woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites. For you, tithe, mint and dill and cumin. That's great. But you've neglected the weightier provisions of the law, like justice and mercy and faithfulness. These are things you should have done without neglecting the others, you blind guides who strain out a net and swallow a camel. A little sarcasm there. Another indictment. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you clean the outside of the cup really well and the dish, but inside you're full of robbery and self-indulgence. You blind Pharisee. First, clean the inside of the cup of the dish so that the outside may become clean also. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. Even so, you too outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, adorn the monuments of the righteous and say, if we had been living in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in the shedding of the blood of the prophets. Not true. Consequently, you bear the witness against yourselves that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up the measure of the guilt of your fathers, you serpents, you brood of vipers. How shall you escape the sentence of hell? The answer to that question is you won't. Let's pray as we begin. Father God, there is no way that we can avoid the tension of this text. It's noticeable. There is an anger here, exhibited by Jesus himself, against a system that was destroying people, but all the time, using your name and perpetrating lies. And Father, we have learned that these kinds of issues are not dead today. They still exist. they still have the same impact. But one of the benefits of this text is the picture we are able to get in our mind, and that is of you standing in this courtyard of the Gentiles, the temple, in the middle of this system, standing and fighting for us so that people could be redeemed, so that people could gain access to you, so that the burden could be lifted. And Father, as we continue to move into this text and again see you in this context of fighting for us, we pray again that you would energize this study so that it would be more than simply information, but that it would have the impact, even that originally it had, on the hearts and minds of people who are hungry for God, and that is that they come to know you and are set free by you. Pray your control of this time in Jesus' name. Amen. Having grown up in the church, and I think having grown up in a reasonably healthy church, One of the things I heard a lot about and was warned often of was the kinds of things that could destroy the purity and vitality of the church of Jesus Christ. Usually, what we identified as the enemy or the source of danger was some ism, secularism, humanism, materialism, liberalism. And while those things, I think, do pose dangers to the vitality and purity of the church, there was always a sense in my mind as I grew up under that kind of focus that the real danger to the vitality and purity of the church was somewhere out there. And we needed to make sure we guarded ourselves against any of that out there coming in here. What we are learning these weeks in this text is that very possibly the greatest threat to the purity and vitality of the church is an inside job. it's when false shepherds wolves in sheep's clothing wells without water empty talkers from within come not sparing the flock Acts chapter 20 so serious is this issue of an internal defilement with false systems and false teachings that destroy people that the final sermon ever preached by Christ before his crucifixion was not a sermon on salvation it was not a sermon on the resurrection It was not a sermon on sanctification or service or the power of God in the life of the believer. It was this sermon, this word, warning the disciples, the multitude, and now us today, against false leaders, false systems. And the first thing that Jesus did for us, and this happened several weeks ago, was in verses 1 through 12, identified how to spot a false system or how to spot a false leader. One of the things we discovered early on was that while false systems and while false teachers are to be sure deceptive, they look like whales, but they're whales without water. They look like sheep, but they're sheep in wolves' clothing. While there is an element of deception, the relief to us is this, that in verses 1 through 12 it was clear that they are able to be spotted. You can discern them. There are indicators and they are clear. We got five of them in those 12 verses. the first very clear indicator of a false system or false leader is that they operate with a false basis of authority. Need to lay this groundwork again. If you've been with us every week, hang with me here, but this is absolutely necessary that we get reminded of all of these things. The false basis of authority was seen in verse 2, where the scribes and Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses. You could probably do this as well as I could by now. The chair of Moses was what? The seat of authority. That was the basis of authority, they placed themselves into that seat. They did it to themselves, it says there, and the basis of them placing themselves in authority over people was not on the basis that they were right. It wasn't on the basis that they were true. It wasn't on the basis that they were sensitive to the Spirit, and therefore did have legitimate authority. The basis of them placing themselves in authority over people was on the basis of their position, their status, their job, because I'm a Pharisee. That's why you're going to listen to me, because I'm a scribe. That's why you'll listen to me, because I'm the pastor. That's why you're going to do what I say. Because I'm an elder, that's why you're going to do what I'm saying. And the wonderful part about that system is if we operate on that basis of authority, you don'T have to be right, you don't have the word of God, you just have to be the pastor. So false bases of authority, when you see that, run. The second indicator we saw of a false system is that there is a lack of integrity. They say, but do not, verse 3. Very often we find that there is even in these people's lives a double life. The third thing is this, and in systems that are false, one of the ways you can tell whether you know all sorts of theology is what it does to your spirit. Does it weigh you down? False systems do that. And in this context, it was very clear that the weight was a performance-based legalism that put tremendous weights of guilt and shame upon people and that was the way we manipulated people and got them to behave the way we wanted them to. It weighs people down. That's what false systems do. Another indicator or sign of a false system is that in a false system, there is a wearing of your religion on the outside. Verse 5, they do what they do to be noticed by men. They broaden their phylacteries, lengthen the tassels of their garment, image is what matters, how things look is what matters, and acting spiritual, And knowing the right words and the right phrases and the right certain coded behaviors is more important than being genuinely spirit-filled, being genuinely born of God, being genuinely spiritual. Work very hard at projecting an image. Once the image is projected, we work very hard to protect the image that we are projecting. The fifth and final indicator of a false system is that they require the accolades of people. they love the place of honor at banquets the chief seats at synagogues respectful greetings in the marketplaces are very important and being called by men rabbi reverend doctor nothing wrong necessarily with that but these guys needed that they demanded that that's a sign of something very wrong and when we came to verse 13 what we discovered was jesus now directing his attention specifically to the Pharisees and the scribes is still ministering to the multitude and the disciples. And it's as if he's saying this, multitude and disciples, church of the open door, these characteristics that I just gave you, I want you to know something. They are not benign. You see, there is a tendency to look at these characteristics and go, yeah, I've seen that. I've been part of a system like that. But they've lightened up a little bit because we're all saying the same thing. It's just kind of a difference in leadership style. After all, we're all on the same team. And then in verse 13, he says, no, we are not on the same team. These characteristics, verses 1 through 12, are not benign. They are extremely serious. Number one, they are serious because literally they shut out, verse 13, the kingdom of heaven from people who are trying to get in. So don't you tell me characteristics are really just a leadership style issue. It's bigger than that. They shut off the kingdom from people. Not only do they shut off the kingdom from people who are trying to enter in, but they devour people. Last week, verse 14, they devour widows' houses. We talked about the cause of that, remember, was because of role reversal, where instead of the sheep being fed by the shepherd, and instead of the shepherd being there for the sheep, role reversal takes place where the sheep are really there to satisfy the ego needs of the shepherd. And you have to behave in a certain way, not because God has anything at all to do with it. You have to behave in a certain way because when you do it makes me feel okay about me. I'm using you to fill me. That's role reversal and it abuses people. That's where we came up with that phrase too of spiritual abuse. Right out of that concept of being devoured. We even compared it to sexual abuse. When a parent who was placed in the life of their child for the nurture of that child. And I was given strength and size and knowledge to bring all of that to my child. to nurture and make healthy that child, when the parent turns those roles around and now I begin to use my authority and use my power and use my strength to take from that child something that will gratify me, that is abuse. That can happen sexually. That can also happen, in this text, spiritually. When a pastor or a leader, instead of using their authority, strength, and knowledge to lift people, nurture people, equip people, begins to use their authority, their strength, and their knowledge to suck the life out of people to gratify themselves. That devours people. This is not a minor thing. On top of that, they reproduce, which isn't very good news. Verse 15 says this. They go about on sea and land to make one proselyte. The problem is that while evangelism is great, what they are spreading, what they are reproducing, is not life, it is death. It is not light, it is darkness, it is not health, It is disease. In fact, the text said, when you make a convert, you make them twice as much a son of hell as yourself. Today, five more. Five. Can you believe that? We're going to fly. Hang on. Put your seatbelts on, and here we go. Another impact that these kinds of systems and people have in the lives of people is going to come in 16 to 22. And the way I'm going to say this is that they produce a tremendous amount of insecurity and fear in the lives of people. Let me explain how I get that out of this. You blind guides, you swear by the temple, you say that's nothing but. If you swear by the gold, now you're obligated. What is that saying? It's saying they lie. It's saying they lie. It's saying they don't talk straight. They don't talk straight. They don't give you a straight answer. They hardly ever say what they mean. They say all sorts of words, but you never really know what they mean. Everything they say is kind of veiled, it's kind of hidden. It will be pious, believe you me. It will be right. It will seldom be real. Do you know the difference? And everything will have a double meaning. And I'm sure that you can connect with times you've been in conversations, not just with leaders, but with people, where you're in this conversation and they're saying an answer and they're sounding very nice, but for some reason, you just feel like going, I'd like to poke through this to find out what they're really saying. When you're in a system where all of these things in verses 1 through 12 have become part of the fabric of their being, you will never get a straight answer. The result of that is that you can never confront them. Because when you do, they kind of go, they go, no, it wasn't the temple, it was the gold of the temple. Yeah, that's a ticket, it was that. Oh, it wasn't the altar, it was the offering on the altar. That's what I really meant. Yep. Great. You never confront. They just keep moving all the time. You can't ever pin anything down. And when there is that spirit of constantly changing the rules and never talking straight and literally lying, that breeds in people a tremendous amount of insecurity. Who can I trust? What can I believe? What do I know for sure? How do I know where I stand? Ever. I never do, because they're never talking straight. I wish they'd blow me up. I wish they'd say, get out of here. I don't like you. I mean, I wish I'd hear that rather than, well, it's good to see you today, Brother Dave. I think you're good. You know, that's poke through that thing. But you swear by the temple. Wonderful. Let's look at this a little bit. To swear. Swearing doesn't mean to use foul language here. It means to affirm with an oath that what I say is true. So because I want you to believe me, and because it's important that on this particular subject we're on, that you do believe me, I will add an oath so you really, I swear to God, I'm telling the truth. I swear on the grave of my sainted mother. Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a needle in my eye. I'm telling the truth. You can trust me. in a court of law people are called forward and asked to swear i swear to tell the whole truth the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god and we say that kind of thing i swear to god as god is my witness may god strike me dead remember when we were matthew 5 several years ago i suppose it was a while ago i'll get on my back about that we talked about this whole issue of making vows and what we found out in matthew 5 was that this is what it means to take the lord's name in vain taking the lord's name in vain is not just using foul language don't use foul language and don't just walk around using god's name in an irrelevant way but what it literally means to take god's name in vain is to take god's name and attach it to a promise that you have no intention of keeping or are incapable of keeping but bringing god's name into your vow so that it has power because you don't have credibility yourself. I'm going to bring God's name into it so that you believe me. And now I've gained your trust and now I can defraud you. Don't you dare bring God's name into your vow. That's taking God's name and attaching it to your promise in vain. Don't do that. What Jesus was confronting then, what he is confronting now is that the reason you're making vows, I swear by the temple, I swear by all that is just, whatever, you know. The reason you're making this vow is just to get big. And you get big and you say, I swear by the altar and all this kind of stuff. To gain trust. And when you gain the trust, you can defraud them. Verse 37 of Matthew 5, he cuts through all of the garbage and says this, listen, don't make any vows at all anymore. Just let your yes be yes and your no be no. Talk straight. Cut through the stuff. Cut it out. Don't blow smoke, which is an evangelical way of saying don't BS. Don't blow smoke. Don't do that. Just talk straight. Sorry. These guys were full of double talk. They didn't talk straight. His correction of them is very clear. You fools, you blind guides. Which is more important, the gold of the temple that sanctified the gold? You blind men, verse 19. Which is more important, the offering or the altar that sanctifies the offering? And then on through here, verse 20 and 21. Therefore, he who swears, swears both by the altar and by everything on it. So don't con me. And he who swears by the temple swears both by the temple and by him who dwells within it. Who dwells within it? God. So don't you give me this line. What do you have this idea that God can't tell that you're manipulating when you say, I swore by the temple but not the gold? God can tell. God can tell you're doing double talk. People aren't stupid. They can tell you're doing double talk. And God isn't stupid. He can tell you're doing double talk. Where does this kind of line come from? this whole study is is kind of flowing from the fact that when you see characteristics one through twelve or verses one through twelve these other things will be there i think that this kind of lying and making big promises that you don't mean and then kind of shifting your your weight around all over the place comes right out of the soil of a system that needs to have its deeds noticed by men in a system where looking good is what matters you need to add this that not only is it Is it important that you look good, but it will also be important that you sound good? Do you follow me? It will be very important that you please people and that you are right. And if you need to look good, you will need to sound good. And what that means is that if you need to sound good and sound spiritual all the time, you will always say the right thing. You will hardly ever say the real thing. Again, I hope you can track on the difference between those two things. You'll always say what's expedient. You'll always say the thing that gets you off the hook right now. Oh, yes, I promise. I swear by the temple. You don't know. You're just saying the thing that will make you sound pious. Keep your phylacteries in order there. Yes, God, believe me. Yes, hello, hello, hallelujah. Amen. You know, it's just like that. It's like, blech. But you'll never disagree even if you do. You'll never admit you're wrong even if you're wrong. You'll never be able to say you're sorry. You'll never be able to say forgive me because you need to look good. You need to look spiritual. And if you need to look spiritual, you need to sound spiritual. And you're even going to end up defending things that while you're defending what you did, you yourself know that what you're saying sounds incredibly stupid. Well, it wasn't the temple. It was the gold of the temple. And on and on, you're just doing these stupid dances because you can never look bad. You can never be wrong. You can never say I'm sorry. You've got to always be doing a dance. They are in bondage. I believe it is absolutely inevitable that if you are in a system or perpetrating a system where looking good is what matters, this external religious show, the plant that will grow out of that soil is lying. You will lie. You will say the right thing. You will rarely say the real thing. There will constantly be this moving around. If you've ever talked with anybody, it's going to be this, it's like that. But there's a far more serious ramification of that at a different level where that kind of dynamic absolutely destroys people. It works like this. The reason I lie to you, make a vow, oh, you can count on me, is to gain your trust. And when I gain your trust, you know what you do? You relax. This is a safe place. I can believe her. I can believe him. I feel safe here. Put your guard down. When you put your guard down and you relax and I've gained your trust, I can do anything I want to you. And I can get anything I want from you. And slowly and silently, I can stick in the knife and drain out your life blood. And you know what? That is why victims of abuse, whether it's sexual or spiritual, have a terrible hard time trusting. Because they trusted once. They did. They trusted. And they gave their heart, and when they did, they got trampled. Jesus is real angry about that. It creates incredibly insecure people who never know where they stand. There's another impact, and that is this. These symptoms of verses 1 through 12, this false basis of authority, because I'm the pastor, that's why, this putting on heavy weights of external performance legalism, and this external show, broadening your phylacteries, how things look is what really matters. The other thing that that produces is a spiritual value system that gets inverted. And by the way, whether you understand anything else that I've said about this theologically, if you're in a system where you begin to notice these following things, You can know. Don't wonder if you're in a false system. Know for sure you're in a false system when spiritual values get inverted. What do you mean? Well, let's look at the verses. Verse 23 and 24. What do you, scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites? You tithe mint and dill and cumin. Mint and dill and cumin were little herbs and seeds. We've gone over that before. And they would take care of that little tiny little thing. Oh, boy, am I spiritual? I'm doing that. But you've neglected the way to your provisions of the law, like justice, mercy, and faithfulness. In systems that are growing out of the soil of verses 1 through 12, everything gets turned upside down. Little things become very big. Unimportant things become very important. Very important things get swallowed whole. Irrelevant things become paramount. Trivial things become vital. And vital things are absolutely ignored. Vital things like justice, mercy, and faithfulness. Jesus didn't just pull those attributes out of a hat. In Micah 6, verse 8, I think Jesus is quoting this. That passage says this, What does the Lord require of you but to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God? To walk humbly with your God is simply to say to walk dependently, to walk faithfully, depending on God as your only hope. That's what is required of you. Depend on God as your only hope. Do justice and love mercy. And while these guys were making sure they tied their dill in mint and kilman, they were unmerciful, they were unjust, and they didn't have any idea what it meant to walk by faith because they walked consistently in the strength of their own effort. Works. You got inverted values. And it's one of the things that happens when the characteristics of 1 through 12, verses 1 through 12, happens. Verse 24, he illustrates it somewhat humorously. blind guides who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel. A little teaching here. There were a number of things that to a Jew were unclean. They couldn't eat them. They couldn't drink them. Among them was a gnat, unclean, don't touch that, and a camel. It was a little easier to avoid a camel than it was to avoid a gnat. If you swallowed a camel, you'd know it. But, you know, gnats, you had to work a little harder to make sure you didn't do that. And in those days, you've got to figure Palestine, there isn't any refrigeration. They don't have some of the techniques we even have today. So in their food, there's gnats all over there, and they're picking them out. But the big thing was in their wine. They would be drinking their wine, and that was what they drank, and they would try to make sure they didn't get any gnats in there. And they were very fastidious about that. They had a process they'd go through. No matter how hard they worked, you think there were any gnats in there? Well, they're pressing them, and they're in there. Well, anyway, it got down to the point where they would actually begin to drink the wine and sift it with their teeth. They go, and then he picked the gnats out. Yeah, got one of those little burgers. Yeah, yeah, got that little boy. I'm so glad I didn't touch that. You guys are incredible. You sift it at gnats. You strain it at gnats. But you guys could swallow a camel without a blink. Now, he's obviously speaking metaphorically about an inverted spiritual value system where all of a sudden little things are real big to you and big things that really do matter are insignificant to you. You'll swallow them right now. Little things get real big. I remember one of the frustrating things I had when I first came into the ministry was this hard-to-do ministry and do the God stuff and advance the kingdom and being in a church. I've been here nine years, and it's really fun to see how God has kind of taken control. But even just to reflect on some of the things we talked about in our board meetings, I'm sure you've had to do this. Absolutely insignificant, irrelevant. You know, let's talk about lining the parking lot. We'll spend hours. The Lord, God has said, he is a God of order. And I didn't go, fine, fine. Line the parking lot. But those are the things we all, that's all we ever talk about. We get real big about stuff like that. People going to hell everywhere. I don't care about that. Let's line the parking lot. It's bigger than that. It's bigger than that. That's a small thing. Those are irritating things. You kind of work through it. You kind of gently move away from those kinds of things. And we all do that from time to time, lose perspective. That's okay. We come back. I remember as a kid, seeing this over and over, and as I just give to you some of this experience, please understand that while I've seen people who evidenced these issues, I've also seen people who opened the door of the kingdom to me in these same churches where there was health and vibrancy and a love of God. But I also had experience where there were people, and a lot of people, who never had wine touch their lips. They never played cards, not even Rook. they never danced they never went to a movie they never smoked or chewed or went who with girls who do did or dude or and while they sifted out all those little gnats from their teeth they were bitter sour angry mean malicious gossips able to swallow enormous sin like hypocrisy greed, dishonesty, cruelty, bitterness, all the while they are carefully sifting out bowling. Get out of here. Swallowing the camel, again, of hypocrisy, greed, dishonesty, and carefully sifting out the gnat of how long your hair is. Is it touching your ears? I used to hear that all the time. Nope. All the while, sifting out the gnat of laughing in church. You ever laugh in church? You ever get the, well, you are now. See, there you go. I mean when you're not supposed to, like you get the giggles. You ever get the giggles? It's the worst thing, especially if it's not okay to laugh. First time this happened, well, it wasn't the first time I laughed in church, but I was 10 years old when this incident happened. A lady in our church named Eleanor. Once a year, Eleanor played the bells. Have you ever seen anybody play the bells? It's great. It's just the neatest thing. Eleanor, though, took this very, this was very serious. And so everybody around her had to take it very serious. This was high stuff. She would play her bells, and she'd pick up the bells. You know, and then she'd start moving from note to note real fast. If it was a long note, it was easy, because she'd just go, and then she'd do this little thing where the wrist, but then the notes would start going faster, so she'd start picking them up real fast, you know, and here's this very stiff, formal, a bit sour person, taking this very seriously, going from bill to bill, and I'm 10 years old looking and thinking, this is the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life, and even when I was a little kid, you know, what happens to me now i get these images you know these pictures i get i share them with you it's kind of part of my preaching well i got them then too and the images i got was of her chasing some little bell and going whoa you know whoa it's over and that's what would make me laugh i wasn't even yeah i was i was laughing at her my brother and i would sit together in fact it's every year it happens i'm not going home this year for christmas and i'll miss this but my brother and i used to call them elves bells it was great every year well this particular time i was 10 i got the giggles couldn't stop i got a little talking to it from my mom later on because it was disturbing people and that's not okay but it was funny anyway at the end of the service the end of the service there was a woman and see this isn't even about l lenore it's not about her she was okay she had her way and that was fine i had my way too but anyway they at the end of the service there was another lady who sat right in front of us i'll never forget her i don't know her name she turned around and looked at me with a face of uh unforgettable venom and anger and said to me and my brother are you boys saved I wasn't sure anymore that's for sure and it was clear to me that the sign of the redeemed is that you like Eleanor's bell that's i didn't have the savvy at that age to sort through everything but i do remember something bothering me in my spirit not not after dealing with the incredible indictment you know it's not okay don't do that it's like do do do die to tie your dill and minting human that do that and Don't laugh in church when you're not supposed to. But don't be neglecting the weightier matters of the law. I remember as a kid wondering why it was okay for her to be mean and sour and dried up and have basically the disposition of the wicked witch of the West. But if you laugh in church, that's the biggie. People have an incredible capacity when the characteristics of verses 1 through 12 are there to swallow the camel of bitterness and then strain at the gnat of childish inappropriateness. Deal with the childish inappropriateness. But inverted spiritual values is a sign that something is very wrong. Do not treat that like a minor matter. Another story along these lines. Anthony Campalo made this famous some time ago. I don't know what seminary he was in. I think every seminary is claiming the story now. Happened at Bethel, happened at Biola, wherever. he was bringing an illustration that clearly illustrated this thing when he said this what you need to know is that there's i don't remember the number five fifty million people today right now starving in such and such a place and the thing that really grieves me is that most of you don't give a damn and then he went on to say after there was an incredible hush in the crowd he says what really troubles me is that most of you are more upset that i said damn than there are 50 million people starving right now what was he confronting he was confronting an inverted spiritual value system that cared more about the word that he said that that 50 million people were starving that is a sign that spiritual values have been turned upside down when we begin to strain in that and swallow camels jesus hated that shared this concept with the staff on wednesday at staff meeting and i said give me some examples Have you ever seen this kind of thing, inverted spiritual values? They came quicker than I could write them down. It's when a music teacher at a Christian college spends all sorts of time and spiritual energy decrying the evils of contemporary Christian music and begins to go on a great campaign to stamp out what he called sensual vibrato. You need to understand there's certain vibratos when you sing. There's a sensual vibrato and it's demonic and it isn't from God and we're going to eradicate that wonder. Thank the Lord this guy's doing this. And you don't say God, you say God. There's a right way to say God. You say God. Great. Praise God you're saying God. I love that. Do that. Say God right, okay? And get rid of your sensual vibrato and deal with the contemporary music. And the same guy who was big on that stuff was giving back rubs to student assistants in the floor office and then went far further than back rubs sexually with his secretary. and student assistance. What is that? That is an inverted spiritual value system that is able to strain at gnats about how you say God and swallow camels. It happens. It is inevitable when the characteristics of verses 1 through 12 are there. I am not going to go to a guy like that or a system like that and say, you got to get your value system right. Wouldn't do any good. We got to go back to the beginning, talk about false authority, external religious baloney, get it to the heart of the matter, Because when people are dealing with the inside things, real things start coming out. When you're not in it, it's all pretend. Inverted spiritual values will be there. That's how you can spot it. When a Christian leader feels very proud about the fact that he never, I mean never, exceeds 55 miles an hour, never smokes, never drinks wine, never uses foul language, but sleeps with his best friend's wife. True story. inverted spiritual values is when an elder board takes a firm stand about people who serve communion do you realize there was one guy last week who didn't wear a tie they will wear a suit then they will wear a tie and if you don't you won't serve communion in this church and that same elder board when they discover that the pastor is sexually exploiting little children will cover that up for 10 years does that make you mad it ought to it's a result of a spiritually inverted value system that comes out of the soil of a false basis of authority because i'm the pastor that's why that puts on heavy weights that has an external demonstration of religiosity but no internal reality when that's there you cannot avoid an inverted system it will happen another rebuke is this they spiritually rape people verses 25 to 26 what he describes pharisees hypocrites you tie the out you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish but inside you're full of robbery and self-indulgence clean the inside so the outside is clean as well that is clearly on on the surface a rebuke of external phony stuff without internal reality but i think deeper than that. It's speaking of something else. What happens when you come to these people in terms of the impact of this phony system is that robbery goes on and self-indulgence. The word robbery there was what caught my eye. Arpage is the Greek word and it means to plunder or rape. To plunder or rape. So putting it together with this verse, you clean the outside of the cup of the dish, but inside people get raped meaning this you got a cup it looks good you got a church it's wonderful the the parking lot is striped it's great there's a little cross out there it says first baptist first lutheran alliance church whatever got a theology that's right just like the scribes got a wonderful smile sounds good you got a great come on it's a godly come on it's not like hey baby it's more like hello there in the name of the lord yeah it's a wonderful come on clean the outside of the cupping of the bowl. But if you get close to this cup or if you get inside this cup, what happens is you get plundered, you get robbed, you get used, you get raped. That is the word, arpage. Again, this is a result of role reversal, using you for our ego needs, using people to build their kingdom. The other word here is self-indulgence. The Greek word is or kassia, it means an unrestrained desire for gain or excess, an unrestrained desire for gain. When you come toward this cup, this church looks good. On the outside of the cup, it says evangelism. We are going to evangelize the world. On the outside of the cup, it says giving to God. On the outside of the cup, it says advancing the kingdom of God. Looks great. Good cup. I go to the cup, I get inside the cup. I found out that inside the cup the evangelism really was not evangelism it was recruiting the giving was not really giving it was taking and advancing the kingdom of God was not what they were doing it was advancing the kingdom of churchy open door or advancing the kingdom of David Johnson or advancing the kingdom of some high powered personality had nothing to do with God inside you're full of robbery rape and self indulgence unrestrained desire for gain verse 26 you guys better look inside you better have more than form the word to you is clean the inside of the cup and of the dish so that the outside of it may become clean as well having a clean cup on the outside is important but the only way it happens legitimately is when it's coming from a pure heart when it's coming from an inside transformed condition by the work of the Holy Spirit this is where I need to back off and really talk to us we better consistently be willing to open up the outside stuff to give God access to our heart to consistently say to us God search our hearts and know our thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in us we better consistently be willing to go past what we see out here in our lives to let the spirit of God reveal to us what's going on in here as far as motives because our motives can switch from day to day do you know that? you can have the right motive today and somehow just lose your perspective and get off tomorrow. You know, I wish there was some gilded edge guarantee. I wish there was some theology that could protect us from ever getting defiled. You know, if we know the right thing, never worry about this happening here. That is no protection. Knowing the right stuff is no protection. The only protection we've got from being defiled in ways like this is if our hearts genuinely and honestly stay humble and pure and broken before God all the time. the only way for that to happen is if we're desperately hanging on to Jesus who's our only hope if they would have done that these Pharisees would have done what he said to do in verse 26 what do you think would have happened? they would have seen past their religious words to their heart their religious performance to their motives and to the lusts that they really had that it really wasn't about God's kingdom they were interested in it was really their kingdom and their ego satisfaction, what do you think would have happened to them? Well, I think, first of all, it would have been absolutely devastating because for years they were building this whole thing on something false. In fact, I wonder, and it is a wonder, this is not a statement, it's really a question. I wonder sometimes if people have operated with a false basis of authority, put on heavy weights, had this external show for so long that when it calls for a look at the heart and look past all that stuff, then I wonder if there's a point at which people can't do that. literally cannot do it because they've done this so long. And to look at that and look at the real motive and look at what's really going on inside of all that stuff would be so painful they think they would die. The truth is if they would look inside, it would be their only hope for salvation because if they look inside and if we would look inside, we'd see a heart that's deceitful and desperately wicked. Who can possibly plumb the depths of that that would then produce brokenness and jesus says blessed are the broken for they get the kingdom blessed are those who mourn over their sin who realize they've been raping people who realize they've been abusing people and they start getting it out here and they quit pretending and they quit saying the right thing and they start saying the real thing blessed are those who mourn they get comfort blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness that they really finally realize cannot be produced by broadening their flackeries and looking better and trying to appear more spiritual. They start thirsting for a righteousness that only Jesus can provide. They're the ones who get satisfied. And after the brokenness, there would come a desperate desire for grace. And when they desire grace, they'd ask for grace. And when they'd ask for grace, they'd get it. So if they don't ever change, what they do is spiritually rape people. The fourth thing is this, they contaminate people. Verse 27, you're like whitewashed tombs, which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside you're full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. Outwardly you appear righteous to men, inwardly you're full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. Again, on the surface, the obvious thing he's confronting is this external religiosity with no internal life. You've got internal death. But he's saying more than that here, and I need to give you some background to get to that issue of contamination. In those days, they didn't have cemeteries the way we do. People are all kind of buried in the same place, so you know where they are. In those days, people were kind of buried willy-nilly. You know, it was kind of wherever, you know. It was all over the countryside they were. Now, according to Jewish law, one of the things that could defile you, again, you wouldn't connect with this, but with a Jew they would, one of the things that could defile you was that if you would touch a grave. If you touch a grave, you've been defiled. These people at this time, when this whole event is transpiring, are coming for the Passover. And people are coming from all over the countryside. And during the Passover, what was the custom was that everybody who knew where their family graves were was they would go out and they would whitewash the graves. And what that would do would be providing a service for all of the pilgrims going through the land to avoid the tomb. And the tombs looked pretty and they were white and they kind of dotted the countryside and it looked really nice, but those whitewashed sepulchres or tombs were not invitations to come. They were indicators to stay away. because if I go toward that and I touch that, I will be defiled. I see that thing and I stay away. The point is this. Again, we have to have that teaching to understand this, but Jesus is not just here pointing out their hypocrisy in this verse. He is pointing out these people's impact. They corrupt you. They pollute you. They are like tombs that are whitewashed. They look good, but the signal you need to read is not to go toward them. It's to stay away from them. There's a very practical application in that, and that is this. Be very careful about thinking you can change a system like this. Be very careful about thinking. Every once in a while I hear somebody say, I'm in a system that's just exactly how you describe this. I'm in a church like this, and I just feel like I'm going to stay there and leaven it positively and be a positive influence. And if God's calling you to do that, I'm not going to argue with you, but I am going to warn you. The biblical principle is this. They corrupt you. Stay away. Avoid them. Leave the system. Verse 28 simply explains why. They outwardly appear righteous to men. Inwardly, they're full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. The principle is it will defile. And all of that stuff of external performance, internal death, grows out of this soil of a phony basis of authority, putting on heavy weights, and an external focus of religious behavior. The final thing is this. They honor the prophets of the past and hate the prophets of the present. Verse 29. What are you, scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites? You build tombs of the prophets, adorn the monuments of the righteous, and say if we'd been living in those days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets. We wouldn't have crucified or we wouldn't have executed Isaiah or Jeremiah or Ezekiel. We would have been on their side pulling for them. And Moses, what a guy he was. And you might even hear things like this. Oh, where are the Ezekiels of our day? Where are the Jeremiah's that God would raise up a man, a person who would come and speak the truth the way they did? That's a bunch of baloney. If the Jeremiah's did come to them, they did. The Ezekiel's did come. The Isaiah's, who was their prophet? Jesus was right in their face speaking the truth. One of the signs of a false system is they're going to have the prophets hanging with a picture on the wall. Oh, he's our founder. Oh, what a guy. We love Moses. We love Isaiah. We just don't like you. We love the that they told the truth without compromise. I just hate it when people tell the truth without compromise. What these systems love about the prophets of old is their memory, their quotes, and their picture. What they don't like is their passion and their fire because the fire and passion of a true prophet would burn up most of what they care about, would destroy their false gods, would obliterate the tradition of men, It would expose the pretending and hypocrisy and call them to repentance. We wouldn't have done what those people back there did. Principle is the way you spot a false system. This is the final one. One of the ways you can spot them is that they love the dead prophets, the good old days, but when there's a prophet right in front of their face, they'll ignore him. These guys crucified Jesus. Verse 33, just wrapping up, he pronounced a curse. You serpents, you brood of vipers, how shall you escape the sentence of hell? The answer to that is they won't. The next time we will deal with the fact that they are targets for the wrath of God. Wrap it up. False leaders. Who operate with a false basis of authority because I'm the pastor, that's why, who put on big weights on people and don't lift it off. Who have an external performance, pretending, creating of an image, how things look is what matters. motif for their Christian life, what they do is, number one, shut the door of the kingdom to the people who are trying to enter. They devour people. They reproduce their disease and their converts. They never say it straight. They invert spiritual values. They spiritually rape. They contaminate the people who are around them. They honor the prophets of the past, hate the prophets of the present, and are targets ultimately of God's wrath. What do we do with all this? what do you do when you see it in somebody well first thing i want to say about that and just in closing here is i think you need to confront it now that sounds in conflict to something i just said because remember what i said they're whitewashed sepulchers and you'll get defiled if you go by them the reason i think you should confront it first is because of this i think that even true prophets can lose their perspective even true spiritual leaders can lose their perspective from time to time and start caring about external things not internal things can start using their authority in a wrong way. And it doesn't mean they're right out of the book false leaders like this. There are times we're going to lose our focus. When I lose my focus, did you hear the way I said that? When, I didn't say if, I will lose my focus. You will lose your focus from time to time. When I do, one of the safeguards is that we have people who will come and say, you know what? We've lost focus here. we're starting to care about things that don't matter there's a confrontation and among true leaders among people who are genuinely sensitive to the spirit of god the most delightful thing that can happen to you is remember matthew 18 when we all kind of wander away the people in matthew 18 weren't people rebelliously rebelling against god they were sheep they were just kind of walking along and they got distracted and they started walking over here and they got a gift from somebody and that was that they went like this and they brought him back to the folly says get back here you idiot you're acting like a jerk come back here we love you get back to what you care about you care about jesus you don't care about that quit caring about that i get back every week does that scare you i don't know i the point is i lose my focus every week and every week there's a coming back and a coming back and what is it that we care about what yeah okay it's this it's jesus it's jesus over and over and over and over again so when you first see this rebuke it confront it say it out loud. Maybe one of the signs of a true prophet, a true spiritual leader, a genuinely redeemed is that when you do correct, they respond. But then the next thing is this, that if there is that confrontation and there is no response, in fact it's kind of a violent angry response, then I would say this, run from it. Run from it. If they don't receive it, leave it. Final application would be this, what if you see this in yourself? what if you're here this morning and you're saying not only was i in a system like this but i became a very vital part of systems like this where i can see now as i look back on some of my christian leadership and teaching sunday school and whatever else that i did that that as as much as i i i didn't realize i was doing it but my authority was this yeah because it's me that's why it was this false base of authority wasn't gentle it wasn't because it was true it wasn't because i was sensitive i didn't have authority that was really coming from the spirit it came from my bigness as i look back at my ministry when i really look at it i can tell that most of what i did was put heavy weights on people i wasn't extending grace to lift the load i was getting them to jump through hoops for me had nothing to do with god you know when i look back in my ministry i i i recognize the fact that that so much of it was teaching people how to act spiritual not be spiritual so much of it was teaching people how to how to look good not be real talked to a woman last night right outside this door as i was leaving and she was in the just in the opening here and that's exactly what she said to me she said dave i have been in systems like this and god's dealing with me these weeks over the kind of healing that i need because i have been victimized and wounded by this kind of system but but right now what god's laying on me real heavy and it doesn't feel good at all. I was a teacher in a Christian school, she said, little kid. And all I can remember is I'm just thinking about the people. I put weights on them and I put expectations and I never gave. If I could have just given them Jesus. She was going through brokenness and she was mourning and the Spirit of God was coming to her and redeeming that situation. She was already redeemed. or if we've been like that we just need to ask god for brokenness and ask god for forgiveness and repentance and become genuine leaders we don't operate with a false basis of authority but whose authority comes because their sensitivity to the spirit see there is authority in spiritual leadership but it's when the leadership is spiritual there is authority there is a power but it's when there's sensitivity to the spirit when we're being real not just right and then there comes authority but it's not because you demand it it's because it's there and people notice it we need to be about the business of doing what jesus did come unto me all you who are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest not me dave johnson jesus is the rest giver he's the burden bearer he's the burden lifter he's the one who heals the wound and we need to be about the business of saying this external show stuff has got to go. Being real is more important than being right. The final word is the word from Jesus who said, Folks, a bruised reed I will not break off, and a smoldering wick I will not snuff out. Thank you.
