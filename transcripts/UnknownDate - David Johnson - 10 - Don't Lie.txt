Lord, it occurs to me that this hiding thing that Steve is talking about in that song, we've been doing that a long time. In fact, it began in the garden when Adam and Eve saw that they were naked and ended up being ashamed and hid from you and hid from each other. And since then, you've been calling us out of the dark. And the rabbi says, come. And become the kind of people who can live in the light of what is true about themselves and about you and about life. Because you just love what is true. I pray, Father, that as we get into this word today, that the stirrings deeply would be a desire, because of your amazing grace, to step into the light and quit hiding. And quit lying. I pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen. We've been calling them these last several weeks. I think it's even spread into months. The Ten Great Words for Life. Our study of the Ten Commandments. Given by God to His already redeemed people as the best possible information. On how to live life and how to live it to the full. We've dealt with seven of the commandments so far. The final three are these. shall not steal, lie, or covet. And because I'm going to be connecting stealing and coveting, saving them for another talk, we're going to deal today with lying. You shall not lie. Exodus chapter 20, verse 16. The text actually is a bit more specific than lying in general. You shall not bear false witness is what the verse actually says. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor, which brings us to specifically things like gossip and slander, to unjustly accuse and innocence, which I know in your spirit you can tell is a dangerous thing to do, a damaging thing to do. You shall not lie. Proverbs 6, 16 says there's six things that God hates. Indeed, seven are an abomination to him. Among them are these haughty eyes, a lying tongue. There it is already. A lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood. God hates that. A heart that devises we evil schemes, feet that run swiftly to evil. A false witness who orders lies. There it is again. And one who spreads strife among his brethren. And one of the ways you spread strife is with lying. So three of the seven things that God says are an abomination deal with this issue of speaking falsehood. Proverbs 6, 12 describes one who walks with a false mouth as a worthless person, a worthless person, a wicked man. Why? Because he winks with his eye, he's shifty, you know the type. He signals with his feet, he points with his finger at other people, thus directing attention away from themselves. And in all of that, they're constantly spreading strife. So lying lips, says Proverbs 12, 22, are an abomination to God, but those who deal faithfully in the truth are God's delights. Then I think about that little girl. We've spoken of her before, a little girl in Sunday school. We had a slightly different rendering of that verse, a little closer maybe to our experience of that verse, that lying is indeed an abomination to God, but it's also a very present help in time of trouble. The fact is, I think we'd all agree that there are many ways to lie. And while we'd probably all say you should never lie, we'd probably also agree that some lies do more damage than others, like gossip and slander to unjustly accuse an innocent. more serious are those than what we might call little white lies. You know about those. Most of us consider little white lies harmless, sometimes even polite. I'll never forget early days here at Open Door. In fact, I'd only been here about a year. Our oldest daughter, Andrea, was three, maybe four years old. I was speaking with a man after church, just standing there talking to him. And this guy didn't happen to be a big fan of mine, so I'm kind of trying to win him over one way or another when Drea approached oblivious to our conversation and said out loud something that was obviously true. Boy, are you fat. Cute kid. Daddy, don't you think he's really fat? No, I know, honey. I hadn't really noticed that. I think he's big boned. The fact is, there's lots of reasons that we lie. Sometimes to save face, to protect ourselves, to avoid a consequence. Sometimes we lie to sell a product, to gain some advantage. Maybe we would even lie to protect someone else's feelings. And we would all agree it's not a good thing to lie, but some lies do more damage than others because some people lie for revenge. some people lie falsely accused for malice or control to get what they want when they want it and what they want maybe in this case is custody of a child in a divorce settlement so they lie believe it or not I know it's hard to believe some people lie to get what they want and it doesn't have to be a bold lie in situations like that sometimes a little exaggeration will work just fine Just a little word, just one little word, throw in abuse somewhere or neglect somewhere and you win. Cornelius Plantinga in his book, Not the Way It's Supposed to Be, a Brevery of Sin. It's a book about sin. I've quoted it before. I really recommend the book. I've never read a book about sin. It's what it's about. He observes that sticks and stones can break our bones, but lies can break our hearts and our careers. They can ruin reputations, wreck marriages, and start riots. Even in the relatively urbane settings of great universities, calumnies or false accusations, slanderous lies cause faculty rivalries, tenure wars, and administrative feuds that make life hazardous for everyone involved. And these are merely the civilian lies. In wartime, as the saying goes, truth is the first casualty. Wartime propaganda, he says, characteristically involves a demonizing of the enemy, which is all the easier if he belongs or she belongs to some other racial group. Thus, during the Second World War, the U.S. Department of the Treasury discovered by market research, interesting, by market research that they could sell more war bonds if it concentrated its demonizing on the Japanese, depicting them as squinty, yellow, toothy, and alien, rather than on the whiter and more Lutheran-looking Germans. it also made the Japanese easier to kill which is convenient which is what actually the Germans were doing to the Jews all of it rooted in lies connected to murder and racism systematic evil demonically born I think we'd all agree that lying is a bad thing but some lies do more damage than others. Some years ago, there was a TV program entitled To Tell the Truth. Some of you remember it if you're old, like me. The essence of it was simple. The basis was three or four people on a panel, all pretending to be the same person, and the object was that you along, you know, you were watching on TV, along with this celebrity panel, we're supposed to figure out who is telling the truth and who was really the person and who wasn't the person. The fun of the program was the deception. The fact that three of them were lying and only one of them was telling the truth. The fun of it was that things and people are often different than they appear. And it really was fun and really funny and almost always surprising. And then at the end of the show, in fact, it was a successful show. If the person who really was the person they claimed to be was different, I would have never thought it was that person. Everybody at home laughs and it's a good Tim and it was a good show. The problem, however, is this, when we're forced to play that game in real life, like every day, like all day, having to constantly wonder, who are you really? And what do you want really? So who can I trust? And who can't I trust? It's part of the system. We've almost grown used to it. I think we have grown a network of fabrication. It's become part of normal conversation. You don't even think about it anymore. So I just kind of understand that there are certain times where I need to not just understand what you said, I need to decode what you said to try to figure out what you meant by what you said. Almost as if we develop this idea, this assumption, everybody lies. I got to deal with it every day, all day, I love these salesmen who act like they care about me. They just meant me. And they call me by my name, Mr. Johnson. And I'm sure some salesmen, many salesmen, many salesmen here, good people, lots of integrity. But even the good ones, because I expect them to lie, I don't trust even the good ones. How about you? You know, it's weird though, as I'm picking on salesmen, and I don't mind doing that, but I just need to make sure I pick on me as well. It's interesting. I read a book this week. At least I thumbed through the book. I don't want to lie. Yeah, there you go. I'm in deep trouble this week. I lie most of the way through this whole thing. I'm making up stories all the time. The thing with Dre, it didn't happen. Yes, it did. Yes, it did. Book, Anatomy of a Lie, ranked the top 10 people that people don't trust. Guess what people group was among the least trusted people group in America, televangelists. Top ten. So that's why I'm not on TV. Anyway. But you put all that stuff together, and it causes some of us to simply decide something. And what we decide is this. I'm going to trust nobody. Which means that lying can effectively kill not only people, like Nazis killing Jews, But lying can effectively destroy the possibility of community or intimacy, a meaningful relationship that has any longevity, all of which is at least part of why God hates a lying tongue, a false witness who utters lies. He hates the winking of the eyes, the shifting of the feet, the pointing of the fingers. It's not me, it's him. It's not us, it's them. because it undermines everything. Jeremiah 5. Jeremiah 5 is a fascinating story in this regard, where God is looking for someone in Israel, particularly in Jerusalem, who according to verse 1, does justice and seeks truth. By the way, those two things go together. They're inseparable, justice and truth. You can't have one without the other, and God is looking for just one person. If I can find a man, if there is one, then I will pardon all of Israel and won't bring this judgment. But all Jeremiah can find in verse 2 is people who, although they say, as the Lord lives, which means it's a different way of saying, I swear to God so you can trust me, they, in fact, swear falsely. In other words, they lie. Everybody lies is the conclusion in Jeremiah 5. So Jeremiah, almost in despair, says this, verse 3, I don't know how to find this kind of person, God, because here's the problem I have. Because though you've smitten them, you've given them consequences for their lying. They haven't weakened in their lying. Though you consumed them, they haven't taken correction. Indeed, they've made their faces harder than rock, and they've refused to repent, which speaks to at least two things. Number one, stubbornness in lying. They refuse to repent even though they've had consequences for their lying. They don't care. They just keep doing it. And it also speaks to skill. Their faces are harder than rock, which means they've become good at lying. See, the problem with lying is that after you lie, you have to tell another lie, to protect the first lie. So before you know it, you have lies upon lies upon lies, a house of cards. Some people's whole lives are built on lies. But now you're to the point that for you to admit anything would open the door to everything so your face gets harder than rock. Because you continue to deny and you continue to wink the eye and shift the feet and point the finger, and you do it with a straight face, like a rock, which speaks to skill. You've gotten good at lying, which is a very scary thing. If not for the liar, the person who's being lied to, imagine being married to a man or a woman whose face is hard like a rock, which means they can look you in the eye and lie, and you can't tell. would it create any kind of like unsettledness in you imagine being in business with someone whose face is like rock or just have a friend who's able or even have a child I think you've all had those kinds of things where you're looking at your son or your daughter and they're doing whatever they're doing being a goofy kid and they lie and you know they lied and the real scary part is when they look you in the eye and do it and they don't flinch and go, something's really wrong here. Because to have a face like rock means no one can read your face anymore. You don't blush. You don't blink. You don't look away. It's frightening because it means that something in your soul is dead or dying, which is why the prophets say repent. And the reason they say repent is this, if you don't, you're dead. Charles Spurgeon said that when the heart is untruthful, it is then prepared to be the seedbed of every evil thing. Any crime is possible to a liar. A liar is capable of anything. In fact, this is where all these commandments begin to bleed together. A liar is capable of adultery. A liar is capable of murder. A liar is capable of theft. He who is rotten with falsehood, Spurgeon says, will give in at the touch of every temptation because they can believe, they believe, they can get what they want when they want it by lying. And when that thought comes into their mind, well, what are you going to do if you get caught? Their answer is, I'll lie. In fact, some may actually be proud of the fact that they can lie without blushing or blinking, but it does speak, as I said a moment ago, to an erosion of your soul. which is why the prophets always screamed repent because if you don't you're dead. Matthew 5, another passage that speaks to this stuff. Jesus in Matthew 5 in the rabbinic style of teaching we've grown accustomed to in the series of following Jesus as our rabbi says to a group of liars actually. Verse 33, you've heard it said that the ancients were told in the law, the Ten Commandments, that you shall not make false vows. It's just a different way of saying the commandment we're looking at tonight, this morning. You shall not bear false witness, but you shall fulfill your vows to the Lord. That's what you've heard it said, what you've heard said in the law, and that's true. But I say to you, make no oath at all, which is a weird thing to say unless you understand what he's really confronting here, and we will in a moment. Then he says, don't make an oath at all. Here's what I want you to do. Just let your yes be yes and your no be no. Talk straight. Say what you mean. A word here about vows. They were very much a part of first century life. Vows were an Old Testament reality, and they were held to be sacred, particularly these vows to the Lord were considered serious business. Defined, a vow to the Lord was the making of a statement or a promise wherein you were calling on God, the name of God, you're calling on God to be witness to the veracity of the statement or promise you are making, and at the same time inviting the judgment of God upon you if what you're saying isn't true. And the whole point of the vow was to get people to believe what you were saying. So they would say, and we even say today, things like, I swear to God as God is my witness, May God strike me dead, my personal favorite. Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a needle in my eye. And I'm saying all that to say, I mean it, I really mean it. I'm telling you the truth. You can trust me. Wink, wink, shift, shift, point, point. So vows were used in situations where the need to be believed, where the need to be believed was significant because much was at stake. So in the first century, vows to the Lord wouldn't be common. It was just used when the need to be believed was significant because much was at stake like at a wedding, for instance, because you really need to be able to believe that we're in this thing together because much is at stake between a man and a woman. Last week I was at a wedding, a young man growing up in our church, you know this kid, and they're making vows, and they're kids, and they're goofy, and they're wonderful, but a lot of stakes are real high there, aren't they? And as they're making these vows that we have all made, and I swear to God, they really need to believe. That little girl needs to believe he's in it, and he really, that young man, needs to really believe she's in it. So we say things like this before God and these witnesses, I promise to stay with you and love you and learn what it means to love you. In sickness and in health, forsaking all others, you just got to believe that. that when someone says that, it's not smoke and mirrors to get what they want from you. So we say, no, no, no, I swear to God. As God, I bring God into this. I want him. I'm inviting his gaze on my promise to you. We do the same in a courtroom for the very same reasons. Indeed, the very fabric of a society is at stake here. Indeed, in our culture. still in our culture, as jaded as it is today. You go to jail if you lie under oath, because without truth you can't have justice. And without justice for all, for the rich and the poor, for the mighty and the small, no one is safe. It all falls apart, thus this commandment. So we say, I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me, what? God. here's the deal see it didn't take long for some people to figure out that if they used the name of God to make a vow they could say just about anything and be believed and so they did start saying that I swear to God you can believe me actually Peter did that remember in the context of his third denial remember that Jesus had been arrested it was a very tense time all the disciples had left him and fled Peter swore I will not leave you I will not deny you and then around the campfire in view of Jesus being under trial and maybe even being beaten terrified I'm sure he was three different people and in rapid succession came and said you were with him did you know him and he says no and no and then the third time it says he began to curse and swear. Those are two different things. To swear means he said, listen, I swear to God, I don't know the man. A lie that he brought God into. As God is, I want God to, so you believe me and get me off the hook here. A lie that, like many lies, would ultimately cost him more pain in the long run than the truth would have cost him in the short run. I mean the truth in the short run, if he would have said, yes, I do know the man, they might have blown the whistle and he might have been in as much trouble as Jesus and he might have even been killed. I'm sure that's what he was afraid of. But in the long term, he ended up wishing he was dead because remember what happened? The cock crowed. And he remembered what Jesus said, you'll deny me three times. I swore to God I didn't know you. And it says Jesus looked at him in the Gospel of Luke, and he went out and wept bitterly, I think wishing he were dead, full of shame for his lack of curse. So Peter lied. In fact, he took God's name to embolden his lie, which is one way to take God's name in vain. We've talked about that before. But he lied for the same reason that many of us lie, not because he was so evil, but because he was afraid. Not because he was so evil. The lie was evil, I suppose you could argue, but he lied because he was weak. A weakness, I'd like to get over, wouldn't you? Did you ever lie like that? When you're cornered, when you know there's going to be a consequence, when your face turns red right away. No, not me, baby. I think we'd all agree that it's not a good thing to lie. And Peter paid a really high price for his lie. I think we'd also agree that certain lies do more damage than others. Peter did some damage to himself. But in Matthew 23 and Matthew 5, there were some liars who were really damaging others. Scribes and Pharisees, Matthew 23, Matthew 5, lied with far more intentionality. And the damage it did went far beyond them feeling bad about it. In fact, they didn't feel bad about it at all, quite frankly. For the scribes and the Pharisees in Matthew 23, Matthew 5, had developed an elaborate and slippery way with words. You ever know anybody like that? They just have this way with words. And you keep trying to get around what they mean by what they say. And after a while, I just go, I don't even know what they're saying. I just don't believe them. They're slippery. They had a way with words designed to deceive. They were designed to deceive for the purpose of defrauding, particularly of defrauding the poor. Scribes and the Pharisees were all about the temple business and the money and the power that they got from it. And so they were always shifting things around so that they could keep their power. And the poor continually were disenfranchised so there was no justice at all in Israel, at least for the poor. And they did all this with vows. But they were slippery vows. I swear. They would say, I swear by the temple. I swear by the altar. I swear by heaven and earth, they would say. And they would say all that to say, you can trust me. I'm looking out for you. But later when the people would come and say, wait a minute, I thought you were looking out for us. I thought you were going to come through for us. They would say, oh, you know, it is true that I swore by the temple, by the altar, by heaven and earth, but I didn't swear to God. And if I had, that would have been binding. But these other things are lesser than that. I swore by the temple, but I didn't swear by the gold of the temple. You liar, says God. Where are you getting all this, Dave? Matthew 23, 16 brings a series of woes. Jesus brings a series of woe to you. It's beginning in verse 16. Woe to you, scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites, you blind guides. When you say, verse 16, whoever swears by the temple, that is nothing. But if you swore by the gold of the temple, then you're obligated. Let me tell you what you are. You are a liar. You think God is stupid? You fools. And it's why in Matthew 5, 34, he says, don't make oaths. See, that's not even some legalistic rule. You should never make an oath. You shouldn't even do vows at a wedding. That's not what he meant. He's talking to slippery talkers. He's talking to liars. don't make an oath either by heaven or by earth or by your head what does that mean i swear by my head for heaven he goes on in verse 34 is the throne of god so god is involved in this i don't care how you kind of try to skirt around this thing in the earth it's his footstool in jerusalem is the city of the great king in other words god's in all of this stuff therefore for verse 37. Let your statement be simple and straight. Let it be yes, yes, or no, no. Some of your texts say let your yes be yes and your no be no, because anything beyond saying what you mean is evil. It's blowing smoke. We'll call it BS. Blowing smoke. What? God calls that evil, an abomination. Indeed, there are seven things that God hates. Three of the seven have to do with blowing smoke. Why? Why is he so upset about it? Well, I've already kind of established that it really damages people. It can kill them physically. It can destroy community. But there's another reason. 1 John 1 verse 5. Here's why. Because God himself is light, which is a metaphor for exposing everything. God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all. In other words, in God, there is no illusion. There's no pretense. There is no double talk. You'll get it from religious people, but not from God. There is no trickery, no falsehood. I love James 1.17 says that every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of lights, God, with whom there is no variation, no shifting shadow. Why? Because God is light. No darkness at all. Therefore, no variation. No shifting shadow. Think on that word variation, particularly as it comes to truth and the metaphor of light and shadow. Radiation makes me nervous because it moves. It's this way one day. It's that way another day, just like people who lie. Because what they said is this, this day, and that, that day. Shifting shadows make me nervous, too, because they deceive. And a shifting shadow, I can't quite see. I'm not quite sure. It isn't entirely dark. it's just shadows and it's a shifting shadow so not only is it a shadow but it continually moves so when I was starting to dial in on what the truth was I thought it was beginning to see and as soon as I think I have okay now it moves I go whoa I'm not sure anymore constantly keeps you up some of you grew up in homes like this that was your life it's crazy making it's absolutely crazy making I thought you said no I didn't say that I said this I swore about the temple not the golden temple shut up you a liar so the good news of 1 John 1 5 is that there's none of that with God again there's a lot of people who use God's name that you can't trust but if we could cut through all this smoke and find God you would find something you really really feel safe with truth about life. No variation, no shifting shadows, no pretense, no falsehood, no lying at all. Verse 6, 1 John 1. But if we say we have fellowship with God, yet walk in darkness, walking in darkness simply means yet your way of life, your walk of life, the way you live is to hide in the dark and be a finger pointer and an eye winker if your way is to hide in the dark, here's the truth about you, you're a liar. And what you're lying about is that you actually have fellowship with God, because if you had fellowship with God, you wouldn't be hiding in the dark. Your way wouldn't be to hide and conceal, and to wink the eye, and to point the finger, and to shift your feet, all of which raises a question. Indeed, it's the question, actually, relative to our becoming the kind of people who say yes when they mean yes and no when they mean no. The question is this, do you have any interest at all in learning what it means to live yourself in the light? Because the key to keeping this commandment, you shall not lie, is not about trying hard not to lie. I mean, you could keep that up maybe for a little bit, and I'm sure there's even little exercises and disciplines you could kind of go into in terms of, you know, putting a guard around your mind and your heart. But the key in terms of really beginning to be a person who is walking not in darkness, hiding all the time, but walking in the light is being willing to live in the light of what is true about, well, first of all, you. your motives that you hide, your heart, your fear, the truth about your ambition and your lust and your selfishness and your anger. Because most of our lying, most of our lying is all about trying to hide that stuff, trying to keep it in the dark, sometimes even from ourselves, in fact if we do this long enough we deceive ourselves into thinking that we really have good motives and we didn't really lie when we're lying all the time our whole life is a lie because we hide by the way one of the best ways to hide is just being pious just phony religion garbage I mean who would suspect you see what I love about the light when I think light here. Think bright, sunny day. Just take it in. You know what I love about the bright, sunny day is that it reveals what is true. And the first thing the bright, sunny day reveals is the beauty of the green tree. I love the light because it reveals what is beautiful so I can enjoy it. And I even love the fact that it reveals what is dangerous. I can see when the light is on the cliff so I don't walk over this thing right here. But what I love about the light, however, There's also what I hate about the light, that it reveals what is true about me. And when what's true about me is about to be revealed, and it doesn't even have to be a grievous sin, maybe just some insecurity, some fear I have. You know what I do? I do what you do. We've been doing this since the garden. I start looking for dark places where I can hide. I start looking for shadowy places where I can conceal. Shifting shadows are the best, quite frankly, because I can just kind of keep you off your, you're just not quite sure, so I don't get confronted. And we do all that shifting and we do all that shadow, we do it with lies, half-truths, insincere smiles, inflated stories, flattering speech, religious God talk, and before you know it, we are the people of Proverbs 6, verse 12. We are the ones. And we didn't start out this way. It's not what we want. But we are the ones who are walking with a false mouth. It's our eyes that are winking, and it's our feet that are shifting, and it's our fingers that are pointing, and we're the ones who are constantly spreading strife. It's not me. It's you. It's not us. It's them. It's them. And if you ever see that, you just step back and go, oh, when did this happen? When did I become this kind of person? Because it's not who you want to be. It's not who I want to be. And then if you're in this process, if you're hearing the voice of God, even this morning the question comes, oh, how can I come home? How can I come back into the light? Well, 1 John 1.6. If we say we have fellowship with him, yet walk in darkness, which again means if our way of life is to hide, conceal, cover, and to lie, we lie and do not practice the truth. The word practice there is real significant. And it's also very practical. Because here's the thing about practice. What we practice over time, we get really good at. And what most of us have practiced is hiding and concealing. Well, I'll do it. lying about who we really are and what we really feel and what we really think. And sometimes we can get so good at that that we don't even know we're doing it. We're hidden from even ourselves. A couple weeks ago, we were talking about anger. Remember that in the context of thou shalt not murder and that anger and contempt was behind murder. And I talked about how some people can be very, very angry, but they don't think they're angry because they never raise their voice. They don't blow up. They use soft tones and they don't swear, but they're seething anger. And if you're living with somebody like that, you know, I mean, they're very angry, but they're always going, well, you know, how do they do that? How do they manage that soft smile and soft words, but remember it was their words are butter, but they're drawn swords. Their hearts are full of war. How do they do that? Here's how. Years of practice. A real radical example of this is in a book called My Father's House by Sylvia Frazier. It tells of tributes paid to her father at his funeral. He was a man of proper and regular habit, she says. A Christian man who didn't smoke and didn't drink, who helped with the grocery shopping, who never took the Lord's name in vain. A polite and neighborly man, he kept his snow shoveled, his leaves raked, and his bills paid. He also sexually molested his daughter Sylvia from the age of 4 to 12, threatening her first with the loss of her toys, then with killing her cat, then with sending her away to an orphanage if she ever brought into the light what he was hiding in the dark. How do you do that? How do you maintain, oh, yes, I'm a pious Christian, and do that. How do you do that? Years of practice. Lots of practiced, winking the eye, shifting the feet, pointing the finger. It's not me, it it's you. You're the crazy one. It's not us, it's them. It's not our group, it's that group. It's not the Christians, it is the Muslims. It's not the conservatives, it's the liberals, it's not the Republicans, it's the Democrats, and round and round and round we go, we lie. Even to ourselves. And if you do it long enough, you'll get really good at it, so the truth will not be in you, says at the end of that verse. See, us, we conservative Christians, the truth is in me, I have the truth, and what you think the truth is there is some doctrinal precept that you believe. No, you are not living in the truth about you or me. Reality. But, and this is where the whole thing turns, and this is where the hope begins to come. But if we walk in the light, verse 7, as he himself is in the light, if we begin to practice. Or is that word? A different thing. And maybe start small. Here's a practice. Don't lie tomorrow about the email you send as to why it took you three weeks to return it. Just say, I'm an idiot. I really meant to. No, you didn't. Anyway, start a new practice. If we begin to practice bringing out into the light what's really there about our sin, what's really there about our fear, about our anger, what's really there about our lusts, that I want to hide from everyone, what's really there about our ambition, and we begin to do that with people that we really trust. And by the way, don't do it with people you don't trust. The most amazing thing will happen. If you begin to practice bringing out into the light what's really there, It says in the middle of verse 7, this amazing, you will begin to have fellowship with one another. Maybe for the first time. Remember how I said lying destroys community? Lying destroys the possibility of intimacy or relationships. But if you begin to come out into the light with other people who are doing or at least desiring to do the same, you begin to have fellowship with one another. And the reason you're finally having community with another human being isn't because you formed a small group. It's because you quit lying. And it won't happen any other way, by the way. The reason all of a sudden you have relationships is your eye quit winking and your feet quit shifting. And your finger quit pointing. And you started maybe saying for the first time, you know what? You know what? I think it's me. You know what I think? I think it's us, not them. And when you start talking like that, the strangest thing begins to happen with the people around you. You know what they start doing? Trusting you. Who would have thought that? Because what they're used to is the finger pointing and the eye winking and the feet shifting. And even if they're in a relationship with you, they are doing this with you. I'm not getting close to that person. I just can't do it. It scares the jeebers out of me. So here's the deal, says John in verse 8. If you say you have no sin, if you say you're not a liar, you're a liar. If you say you have no sin, it simply means that you're still hiding and concealing. You're lying even to yourself. And the truth is not in us. But verse 9, if we confess our sin, he's faithful and just to forgive us our sin, cleanse us from all unrighteousness. I just say that verse so quickly. Here's the deal. Here's the deal. if what we've been practicing is hiding and concealing let's you know maybe you're a Pharisee or a scribe and you're lying and concealing is about defrauding people and you're doing all sorts of damage I mean I don't even know I go crazy with that but maybe you're a Peter I have a little more room for that I have room for both but you've been hiding and concealing and you're hiding it's just what you've practiced for so long what would give you the courage to come out into the light? What would give you the courage? A sermon that yells at you? You liars! Thanks, I knew that. No, no. The only thing I know that has ever enabled me, emboldened me to come out into the light and quit hiding the things I don't want you to see is that I believe in amazing grace. That when I tell the truth about what's really here, about my real agenda, about my real motive, about my real struggle, that it will be met with grace and forgiveness. Here's the promise. If we confess, if we tell the truth, he is faithful and just to forgive, to cleanse. I have two pictures of God, two faces of God. One face is the face of the lion. When we're hiding and concealing, be it a Peter kind of lie for fear or a Pharisee kind of lie to manipulate and hurt people, let me tell you something, as long as you're hiding, the face of God you'll see is an angry face. Because he hates it that you're lying. But the minute, the minute you stop and go, I don't know how to do this, but I want to step into the light of what is true, the face of God turns and the lion becomes the lamb and the promise is this, if you tell the truth, I will forgive, I will cleanse and we will together learn a different way to live. Because he is faithful and just to forgive and to cleanse. When's the last time you felt clean? You'll never feel clean in the dark. I want to close with a prayer in fact I'm going to have us all pray it together I'll pray it through once it's Psalm 139 we'll even have it on the screen in just a second not right now but here's the deal about this prayer the only way we could pray it the only way we could invite the searchlight of God into our hearts and to say what David says Lord I want you to search me and know me I want you to reveal to me what's really going on. The only way we could do that is if we see the face of the Lamb, is if we believe that there is amazing grace. So remember last week, James 4, draw near to God. I promise He'll draw near to you. Tell the truth about your stuff, and there is the Lamb of God. Psalm 139, the prayer is this. Search me, O God, and know my heart. Try me and know my anxious inner thoughts. See if there be any hurtful way in me and lead me in the everlasting way of living. Would you stand with me? I want us to pray this prayer together. Put it on the screen. And I don't want to embarrass you or anything, but I wonder if you're willing to pray this prayer. It's a neat way to end the service. I wonder if you're willing to pray this prayer. With me out loud, search me, O God, and know my anxious heart. Try me and know my anxious thoughts and see if there be any hurtful way in me and lead me in the everlasting way of living. we pray these things in Jesus name Amen Amen.
