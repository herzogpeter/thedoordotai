And I ended up here. So I don't think I'll make that mistake again, obviously. But I do feel really honored, I feel really privileged to have an opportunity to just share a little bit of my heart with you today. If you've been around Open Door for a while, you may have noticed you've heard more and more about the least and the lost over the years. We've been looking for ways to care for the poor. We've invited you to come along. Many of you were here when we moved into the building and we started our first Beyond Our Door campaign. You've listened to Steve get up here and talk about Africa. I've been up here and asked for money and tutors and food and school supplies. We've had Ephraim come and visit and invite us to get involved in the inner city. And a lot of you have graciously joined us in those efforts to raise this money, to give of our time and talent. But let's be honest. I think there's a lot of issues that arise when we start talking about the poor and poverty. I think a lot of us have questions about this stuff. I mean, some of us are wondering, all this money we're collecting, aren't we sort of throwing it into a black hole? I mean, I can give $100 to whatever that guy just talked about, but is it really going to help anything? And don't we have things that we need money for around here? You know, even if we could be part of the solution to North Minneapolis or Africa, won't there always be another North Minneapolis? Won't there always be another Africa? I've asked these questions in my life a lot. My husband and I moved to North Minneapolis about two years ago, and it's really been a roller coaster. A couple weeks ago, I was driving to the grocery store, and I started looking at all the boarded-up houses. And then I started thinking about the five schools in North Minneapolis that are going to close next year. And I started thinking, you know, could a place with this much pain ever really change? And could anything that I'm a part of really make a difference? It can be really overwhelming to look at the issues of poverty in the world. And honestly, sometimes I think it's going to drive me totally insane. I mean, there's so many good things to give to you, so many things that we can get involved in, so many campaigns to join. But why, when I look at these issues of poverty, do I feel like no matter what I do, no matter how much money I give, no matter what Church of the Open Door does, not much is really going to change. No one is going to end up anywhere different. Let's just pray as we get started. God, we want to believe in your love that changes the world and in your spirit in and through us. God, that that spirit is put in us to be part of a solution on this earth. Would you just help us understand, help us see the peace that you have for each of us in this as we look at some of these hard questions today. Amen. All right, so I have a story for all of you. I heard this story about a kid from New Jersey. He lived there with his mom, and they had to move to California. So when they got to California, he was the new kid in town. He started getting harassed and teased by these kids. They started beating him "Oh, this is really frustrating for him." So we thought, "You know what? I'm going to learn karate. These kids will not be able to touch me if I know karate." So we talked to his mom. She said, "I can't afford to give you karate lessons." He was pretty bummed out, but oddly enough, he met this janitor in his building. And this janitor said, "I can teach you karate." So he showed up at the janitor's house ready for his karate lessons, and he spent the entire first day waxing the janitor's cars. Imagine it. He thought this could be a test. He shows up the second day, and he's sanding the janitor's deck. What does this have to do with anything? He gets more and more frustrated, but he goes back, and he ends up painting a fence and painting a house. What could this have to do with karate? This kid is very frustrated. He decides, I'm going to confront this guy. I'm going to tell him, I know that this stuff could not be helping me learn karate. Okay, you guys probably know who this kid is. If not, this is the karate kid. And we're going to take a look at a clip that picks up right where I left off. Side-side, yes, show me wax on, wax off. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!! Show Me Pen to Fence. Yes! Yes! Yes! Show Me Side to Side. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Show me sand floor. You see. Look at me! Always look at me. Come back tomorrow. So I think sometimes we feel a little bit like the Karate Kid. I mean, we all know we have this end goal we're trying to get to, right? We're trying to learn to be like the rabbi. And most of us really want to take karate lessons, and we just want to get to it. We want to learn it. So we show up here every week, and we read the books we think we're supposed to read. We go to our small group. We do devotions. sometimes I think this caring about the poor stuff it doesn't seem like it links up we have trouble connecting how caring for the poor could really affect following the rabbi in my day to day life so I think we make caring for the poor this sort of box that we all want to just check off and move on with our lives just becomes this small side note but it's got to be bigger than that because there are thousands of references in the Bible to care for the poor We can trace this theme all the way through the Old Testament and all the way through the life of our rabbi. So here's one of my really big questions. Why would God put such a high value on care for the poor? I mean, what is it, if anything, about care for the poor that's essential to who God is? A few weeks ago on Palm Sunday, we learned about how God rescued his people out of Egypt and he gave them a land of their own. One of the first things God did when they came to the land of Canaan was to lay out some guidelines for them so that they could rightly order their newfound wealth and possessions. These guidelines were about care about the poor among them. He wanted them to keep caring for the poor at the center of their agenda. I mean, God wasn't just making up complicated rules for them to follow. He was saying, if you care about the poor among you, you're going to be doing a whole lot more than just keeping people out of poverty. You're actually going to be being my presence on earth to the people around you. Because caring about these people is really at the center of what it means to be my presence on earth. But we know what happened. They didn't stick with the plan. They didn't keep the poor at the center of their agenda. Instead, the ones oppressed became the oppressors. They hoarded their wealth, they exploited their workers, and they built themselves their own kingdom of excess. But I think they thought there was another way to be like God because the Israelites made sure to fast and pray and pray God's name in public. But that didn't work for God. He sent them the prophets, Isaiah, Nehemiah, Jeremiah, to call his people to return and repent, saying, you've forgotten about the poor, you've turned away from the mission and identity that I've given you, and I am not happy about it. This is the backdrop for Isaiah 58. If you have your Bibles, you can turn there now. The Israelites had been working really hard to do the things they thought they were supposed to do, to fast, to pray, to pray God's name out loud. They think they'd found the way to be his people. Verse 2 of Isaiah 58 says this, They seek me daily. They delight to know my ways. As a nation that did righteousness and did not forsake the ordinance of their God, they ask me of the ordinances of justice. They take delight in approaching God. This all sounds really good to me. I mean, these things sound really important. And I think the Israelites thought so too. In verse 3 they say, Why have we fasted and you have not seen? Why have we afflicted our souls and you take no notice? God, we're trying to be about you. We're trying to do what you want us to do. But let's look at God's response. In fact, in the day of your fast, you find your pleasure and exploit all your laborers. Indeed, you fast for strife and debate and to strike with the fist of wickedness. You will not fast as you do this day to make your voice heard on high. Is it a fast that I've chosen, a day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush and spread out sackcloth and ashes? Would you call this a fast, an even day acceptable to the Lord? Is this not the kind of fast that I have chosen? To loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke? Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and that you bring to your house the poor who are cast out, when you see the naked that you cover him, and not hide yourself from your own flesh? I think there was this disconnect for the Israelites between how they treated the poor, connected with their becoming more like God. I think God's trying to set them straight here. They could fast and pray and go to church and read their Bibles all they wanted. But if they weren't joining him in his care for the poor and oppressed, the least and the lost, then they were missing something central to what he's really about. We talk about loving and caring for the poor in our midst because we really believe God is calling us to be about this. And sometimes it doesn't make a lot of sense. sometimes to me it seems like nonsense but I don't think God cares for the poor just for the sake of it I think he cares for the poor because his entire nature is wrapped up in redemption and restoration and if that's true doesn't it make perfect sense that he'd be calling us to care for the poor to join him in his hope to redeem and restore the entire world I mean isn't that the kingdom of God that we're always talking about around here? I think this call to care for the least and the lost is an invitation for us to participate in the very essence of who God is. Let me say that again. This invitation for us to participate in care for the least and the lost allows us to be part of the very essence of who God is. Thank you. And I think God knew that if we wanted to live in the reality of his image, which is in each of us, in his spirit, which is in us, we had to love the poor. We had to think about the marginalized among us. We had to reach out to the lost. And he knew that if we chose another path, if we built our own empire, if we chose our own way, if we hoarded our things to ourself, we'd just get further and further away from who he wanted us to be. I feel like the Israelites probably thought God was having to paint a fence when he laid out some of these guidelines. They're thinking, God, we know there's an alternative route here to being like you, and we're going to find it. You know, I can relate because I like efficiency. So my question is always, what's the easiest, quickest way to learn what I need to learn? And I remember sitting out there four years ago, and someone was guest speaking here about work in the city, and I just thought, God, what do I need to do to just learn what I need to learn to do that? I'll take a class, I'll read a book, I mean, I'll get a degree, I'll go to a conference and have some really spiritual experience and you can just wave a wand or something. It didn't happen though. Instead, you know, God just showed me a fence and he put a brush in my hand and he said, Jen, just start painting. You know, and some days have been really good and others have been really hard. And I think I've made a lot of mistakes, probably more than I know, and I've said things that I regret. But I really believe that, like with the Israelites, God knew that it was enjoining him for his care and compassion that we could really start to become more like him. All right, back to the Israelites. We know what happened after the prophets. They still didn't get it. And God sent them Jesus. He sent them the rabbi to walk it out for them to see. And, you know, I think we all know that Jesus spent a ton of time hanging out with the poor. I mean, he seems drawn to the people of least value in society. You know, in his day, it was the tax collectors, the sinners, women, Samaritans, lepers. He spent a lot of time not only with these people, but calling the people around him to care for these people. I think sometimes we're tempted to kind of compartmentalize this Jesus on earth from the God in heaven. I know I am. and to think, gosh, you know, Jesus was probably just filling time until his imminent death at 33. And God's probably up there saying, well, Jesus, I think you could find something a little more productive to do, but, you know, whatever. But, you know, we know that's not true. We know that Jesus is the embodiment of God. And so that means that he is the fullest possible expression of God's heart. The fullest possible expression of God's heart on earth. Jesus was doing the unique and purposeful work of God in caring for the least and lost and inviting the people around him to do the same. So maybe some of you will give me that. You know, yes, Jen, this seems to be important. This does seem to be sort of a central theme to what God talked about. It does seem to be something that Jesus spent a lot of time doing. But I don't think we're called to be a part of this just because it's in the Bible a lot or just because it seems nice or seems to sort of match up. I think Jesus lived this out because he knew it was fundamental to who God was. And not only have we been invited to join him, but we can join him right now. With our baggage, with our fear, with our troubles, with our apprehension, with our weakness, we can join him right now. Still, I think we ask, what can I really do about this in my day-to-day life? I mean, if I could see a car to wax, if I could see a fence to paint, I would do it because I want to be like the rabbi. You know, I feel like for me, I've been on this journey of embracing my own story and letting that sort of shape how I determine what care for the poor around me looks like. I am a white, upper-middle class, suburban-born female. I grew up with two parents who created a very safe place for me to learn and grow and play, and I can't change anything about that. I think I've tried, but I can't. And I can't pretend I grew up in North Minneapolis. I can't pretend that I get it or that I understand all the issues there. In fact, the more I do that, the worse things get. But the more that I own my own story and embrace my own story, I think the more I can really start looking at what caring for the poor in my midst, in my life, looks like. There's this couple who started a church for homeless youth in Oregon, and they wrote an article about how people always come up to them and say, you do that? Well, I admire you, but I could never do that. Listen to their response. Don't admire us, because we are the fortunate ones. And yes, you can do that. You can love the poor and oppressed and fight for equality in your own neighborhood, your own church, and your own city if you choose to act. But what you do is going to look different than what we do. It will reflect your neighborhood and its culture. I really believe that. That's why I can't stand up here and give overly simplistic things like we should all move to the city, or we should all sell everything we have and donate it to Africa. It doesn't work that way. But in your life, in your culture, in your neighborhood, what does poverty look like? I mean, who are the underprotected and the overlooked in your midst? I started asking myself this question about three years ago, and I was pretty surprised by what I found out. I used to be a waitress at Macaroni Grill, and I waited on this woman, And she was one of those women who really looks you in the eye and treats you like you really matter. And at the end of one of her meals, I offered her some dessert. I didn't think anything about it. And she looked up at me, and I could kind of sense this loneliness. And she said, "I think I will have some chocolate cake, because your birthday only comes once a year, right?" And I remember thinking, "Wow, the marginalized don't always look like the marginalized." I mean, if I wouldn't have asked that question, I might not have realized that the Overlooked could be sitting in front of me, about to eat some chocolate cake. And so I kept asking. I was in line at Cub Foods, and I got up to the front, and the cashier had these bags under her eyes. She was on edge. She seemed sad and scared and mad. And I couldn't help but to think, this woman must have some really intense pain in her life right now. And the Overlooked was right there in front of me, about to wring up my bananas. And then, I was on the city bus, and we had this bus driver who was yelling at everyone. He was yelling at the kids on the bus, he was pulling the bus away from people who were running to catch the bus. For real. I guess it's protocol. But, you know, I'm thinking, "This guy's a jerk. I mean, what's his problem?" But then I looked at his face, And I realized he doesn't even know what he's upset about. You know? I mean, he's got something going on in his life that's so hard that it's giving him all this displaced rage. And that was an overlooked person, right there just driving the city bus. The more I've asked that question, the more I've seen it. So here's what I'm thinking about poverty right now. Poverty is the single mom who lives across the street from me with six kids, one grandchild, and one on the way, and has very little support. But poverty is also the woman at the restaurant, it's the person at Cub Foods, and it's the man driving the bus. And you've all seen poverty. You've seen people in your own families, your church, your neighborhood, your schools, who are poor in one way or another. There are people in your life right now who represent the hard to love, the marginalized, the underprotected. You've seen pain and sorrow, loneliness and struggle, poverty and possessions, and poverty in spirit. And God sees these people, he knows them, he loves them, he cares for them, and I think he desperately wants us to do the same. So let's say we have identified all these people in our life who are poor and marginalized. still what can we really do about it? And I feel like no matter what I do sometimes I am just painting this fence I could even be doing more damage than good and I'm really not sure if it's going to help anyone or anything but we're lucky that we don't go into this blindfolded because we know we get to watch and learn from our rabbi that he set an example for us to follow because here's something I notice about the rabbi and I envy about the rabbi is that he cares about the poor for real. You know what I mean? I mean, he approaches people and he doesn't think twice about caring for them and loving them and calling them out and I wish I could do that. I wish I didn't think twice. But I think he could do that for a really important reason. I think Jesus could see what God saw. And that made it so easy for him. I mean, Jesus could approach every person like they were uniquely created and totally beloved. He could see the moment that God breathed life into them. Can you imagine being able to see that? And God began this unique story of their life and his image in them. And so Jesus never saw a disease or a condition or a personality trait. Because he always could see the big story of their life, of their trial and their triumph, and their pain and their suffering and their joy. I think the woman at the well is a great example. This is in John 4. Jesus approaches a Samaritan woman at a well, and she was at the bottom of the social ladder in more way than one. She was a woman, she was Samaritan, and she was a well-known sinner. And he does something that's pretty unheard of for a Jewish male. He strikes up a conversation with her, and he asks her if he can get a drink. Even she knows this is crazy. In verse 9, she says, You are a Jew, and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink? But he doesn't stop. He keeps pressing in. I think he's looking for ways to call this woman's belovedness out. so he starts to talk to her about this living water that's available to her and if she drinks of it she's never going to be thirsty again see i think she i think he knew that she was thirsty i mean she doesn't understand what he's talking about but he continues to engage her and keeps talking and then he does something amazing he starts to bring out elements of her story and the things going on in her life let's look at verse 16 jesus told her go call your husband and come back. Well, I have no husband, she replied. Jesus said to her, you are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is you've had five husbands and the man you have now is not your husband. What you have said is quite true. The woman said, I can see you are a prophet. I mean, she's discovering that this stranger knows all these personal things about her life. How can that be? And if he can see that as a stranger, what else could he be seeing? Let's pick it back up in verse 25. She says, I know the Messiah is coming, he who is called the Christ, and when that one comes, he will declare all things to us. Jesus said to her, I who speak to you am he. At this point, his disciples came. They were amazed that he was speaking with a woman, yet no one said, what do you seek or why do you speak with her. So the woman left her water pot, she went into the city and said to the men, come and see a man who told me the things I have done. I wonder what I would have seen in the woman at the well. I'm afraid I would have just seen a poor woman who was a Samaritan and who was known for having a lot of affairs and I wonder how I would have responded. You know, I wonder if I would have made eye contact. I wonder if I wouldn't have even gone up to the well. Maybe I would have tried to go to the next well. But we know what Jesus saw in her. I mean, I think he saw a woman who maybe never experienced real love in her whole life and was desperate for something authentic that she could grab onto, who was searching for this love in her relationships with men. And what did that allow him to do? He could love her and not judge her. He talked with her and encouraged her, calling her out of her slavery to her sin and into the reality of her belovedness. That's why I think if we want to care about what God cares about, we need to start seeing what he sees. Pastor Dave told me this story about his brother Mike, who's a teacher at Park Center High School. And there's this one particular student that he felt like really had what it takes to make it. She was working against some really tough odds. But he was really encouraging her, focus on your studies, dream big dreams about your future. And they were making some progress. It was a really exciting thing until one day she got herself in huge trouble. She freaked out. I mean, yelling and cursing. This would have been the perfect place to judge her. Mike could have thought, yeah, everyone's right. I mean, she doesn't have what it takes to make it. She can't handle the pressure. She's probably going to end up a failure, just like the rest of her family. But Mike decided, you know what, I'm going to reserve my judgment just until I get to talk with her. He was able to sit down with her a few days later after things had cooled off and ask her, what happened? Here's what he found out. The day before the incident, her mom was put in jail. And because of that, she had spent the entire night riding the city bus. And that was the story. That was the story. She's responsible for her actions. But still, when Mike took the time to ask the question about the story, he saw a teeny glimpse of what God sees when he looks at that girl. So here's the question for us. Are we willing to see the story in other people? I mean, are we willing to wonder about the story in other people? I think we have to wonder, because we believe God began and continues a unique story in each of us and in all of the people around us. Because this isn't just a box we're trying to check off. This is about real, created, beloved people, about seeing people and knowing people and loving people and it's about joining God in his hope to redeem and restore the entire world. Terry Steinmeier, who's on staff here, he was playing drums today, and I were having a conversation about this. And he told me a great story I'm going to share. He decided that he wanted to take his son on a father-son bonding trip about four years ago. And they decided to make it a road trip to Colorado. So Terry went to Walmart to pick up the essentials of what he called beef jerky and other manly things. Anybody have ideas? Let me know. And he gets a phone call from a pastor at Open Door who says, Terry, how do you feel about having a passenger, an extra passenger on your ride? Terry says, um, why? Pastor says, well, I picked up this homeless guy on the side of the road, and he needs a ride to the Black Hills. You're going right by there. Terry is like, okay, how do you say no to this without sounding like a jerk? I mean, I don't want to give this guy a ride. Plus, he could infringe on our father-son time. And he's homeless. He needs to get a job and a life. He doesn't need a ride to the Black Hills. What would that even do? He didn't think of a good excuse, though. So he said yes. Terry and his son picked this guy up the next day. They found out his name was Peter. And at this point, they cannot wait for the ride to be over. Ten hours cannot go fast enough. First four hours of the trip, Peter was totally silent. But hour five, he started to talk a little bit. And this is what he said. Told a little of his story. His wife left him a long time ago, and he ran into all these mental health issues. And he was trying to cope, so he started drinking alcohol, and that was a really big problem. And then he moved in with his mom, and his mom passed away, and somehow he had ended up where he had ended up. They were obviously pretty blown away. I mean, how could this guy have experienced all those things? We thought we got it. We thought we understood. And Terry told me they look back on that part of the trip as one of the best parts of their father-son bonding experience because they took time to listen and hear a story. And this thing that must have seemed like waxing a car, wax on, wax off to Terry, actually allowed him to grab a glimpse of what God saw when he looked at Peter. So when they dropped him off ten hours later, not only did they feel like they knew this guy a little bit, they knew he was going to be on his own journey, and he had his own personal responsibility, but they did have a deep compassion and care for him. And it wasn't just Peter they saw differently. It's been every person on the side of the road ever since. I think God knows what's going to happen when we start to see like he sees and care like he cares. I think he knows we're going to become a different kind of people. I think this is going to look really different for each of us. Sometimes it's going to be hard and confusing, like waxing a car or sanding a floor. But we know that there's something about caring for the least and the lost that puts us at the center of what God's about. And I think that's where we all want to be. There are hundreds of stories out there right now of people who have intentionally put themselves in relationship with the overlooked and marginalized, who have tried to see what God sees and care like he cares, and they've experienced change. And a lot of you know exactly what I'm talking about. I got the opportunity to speak with one of our tutors a couple weeks ago, and she was telling me about how, you know, she was showing up in this North Minneapolis school every week, and for a long time she was pretty sure it wasn't helping. It wasn't doing anything. It could be making things worse. But one week she just started to ask, what do you think God sees when he looks at this student? And she just got a little glimpse of this love and compassion. And then she started to care a little bit more. So she started to ask the question more, you know, in her family, on the bus, in the store. And she started to see these glimpses. And with those glimpses, the care came, the care and compassion. The more she asked, the more she saw. I know there's a lot of you out there who are seeing stories and caring for the poor in your midst. A lot of you are loving your hard-to-love in-laws, spouses, kids, people at your office, people at your school. There are people out there who love on their kids' annoying friend day after day after day. And I guess you know who you are. And you don't even realize what you're doing. Some of you go to Starbucks and you get coffee and you actually treat the person on the other side of the counter like they have a journey and a story that's precious to God. and that he loves them in a way that you can hardly even fathom. Some days it's going to be hard to see what we're accomplishing. But I think if we keep waxing and sanding and painting, one day we're going to wake up and we're going to realize we are a different kind of people. And the world around us is starting to change because of it. So let that be encouraging to you. We're doing this in more ways than we know right now. But I want to add this. Are there ways we could expand our vision? Ways we could live in this reality more deeply? I think there are. We aren't supposed to pick up every homeless person on the side of the street. We have to find our peace and our part. And maybe right now for you, it's just reserving your judgment until you know someone. Maybe it's giving money to a cause that stirs something in you. Maybe it's trying to see the story in the person who checks you out at Walmart. But let's not stop there. Those are really good things. We all need to be doing those things. But I want to invite us to keep expanding our care and concern for the least and the lost until it becomes a part of us and we become more and more and more like our rabbi. Stefan's going to come back up and play a song for us. And I just want us to take the next two minutes to sit in this and ask a couple questions. The first one is, who are the marginalized in your midst that God might be calling you to care for right now? And the second question is, are you willing to try to see their story? I mean, maybe you work downtown and you pass this person who's homeless every day. Maybe it's just time to make eye contact. Maybe it's time to just wonder what their story might be. Or maybe your kid has a friend who comes over with dirty clothes and really hungry every day. Maybe it's time to just sit down and ask him or her about their story. I just want to encourage you to make this a conversation with God. I really believe that he has something to say to each of us about this because I really believe he wants us to participate in being his essence on earth and that care for the poor among us is one of the ways that he chooses to do that. Even if this is difficult for you, I just invite you to give it up to God. And let's just sit in this together while Stephan plays this song. Vision and kind It does not envy It is not proud who doesn't boast. It's never rude, never self-seeking, always protects and always holds. We could speak in the tongues of angels, move great mountains through great faith could fathom all mystery and all understanding but have not love nothing is gain we believe love can change the world It's the only thing that has And it's the only thing that will Cause the greatest of these Is love that changed the world You're the only one who can You're the only one who will Never looks back And always trusting Never gives up It perseveres Rejoicing with truth And always forgiving No record of wrongs It casts out fear We could speak in the tongues of angels but without love nothing is gained we believe love can change the world it's the only thing that has it's the only thing that will cause the greatest of these is love that changed the world. You're the only one who can. You're the only one who will. You're the only one who can. Let's just pray together as we close. God, we do believe that your kingdom, that your spirit in us is the only hope for this world. And God, we do want to see what you see. We want to care like you care. And we want to follow the way of our rabbi in his care and concern for the least and the lost. Reveal to us our part and our peace in your hope to redeem and restore the world to yourself. Amen. Go in peace. Amen.
