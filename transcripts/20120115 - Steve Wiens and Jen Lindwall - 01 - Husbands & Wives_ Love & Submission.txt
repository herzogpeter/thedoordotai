How you doing? Excellent. Good to see you. Welcome to Open Door. My name is Steve, and if I want to say also hi to all the podcast people out there, people from all over the place, Israel, China, Japan, Wisconsin, I mean everywhere. Hi to the balcony. Hi, balcony. Rarely do we—yeah, good to see you up there. If you're new around here, meaning maybe started September or later, perhaps you don't even know that what we do around here in terms of our teaching is that we go through a book of the Bible, and we just—we take our time through it. And so maybe you don't know that because we've been in Mission of Values in the fall, and then we were in Advent for a number of weeks, five or so. And, you know, then New Year's, what are you doing New Year's? You can't go back. And so anyway, here we are, back in Colossians, and we've been here for two and a half years. So I thought that I needed to take a little bit of time, no more than one minute, to review where we've been. Well, the community of Jesus followers that lived in Colossae in the first century lived in a really corrupt religious and political environment where they were constantly being told that the Lord and Savior, the Son of God, was Caesar. And Caesar was the one that was going to bring peace on earth, but the way in which Caesar brought it was through oppressive taxation and military conquests, and it did not equal peace unless you were a part of the very minority people that became wealthier or more powerful because of his rule. So this little community of people decided that Caesar, in fact, wasn't Lord and Savior, that there was a different Lord and Savior. His name was Jesus. He lived and died and rose again. And because of that Lord and Savior, they decided to put off things like greed and jealousy and sexual immorality. And because of the resurrection, they could live a different life. And so they decided to put on things like compassion and kindness, not just to each other, but to the world. And that little community of people was a part of the start of what we now are experiencing today when we gather in January 2012. An unbroken line of followers of Jesus who decided to put off things like greed, jealousy, sexual immorality, and put on things like compassion, kindness, gentleness, all because of the one that paved the whole way for us, and his name is Jesus. And so that was the story of the little community who lived at Colossae. And so we're back in Colossians. I want to invite you to turn in your Bibles if you have them, or your iPhones or droids or whatever. Colossians chapter 3, verse 18. If you don't have any of those, you can read it up on the screens. You're going to see immediately a very troubling verse. Yes, that we are diving into. Here we go. Colossians 3, 18. and 19. Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and don't be harsh with them. That's as far as we're going to get today, but I want to read to you the rest of this passage, because it's all connected. Children, obey your parents in everything. I love that as a parent, in everything. But this pleases the Lord, pleases your dad too. But fathers, don't embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, and do it not only when their eye is on you to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. And whatever you do, work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward, because it is the Lord Christ, not the Lord Caesar, that you're serving. And those who do wrong will be repaid for their wrongs, and there's no favoritism. I like how that last verse is just kind of thrown in there as if we're going to go, oh, wait a minute. Oh. So, yeah, these are tricky verses, gang. We're going to be in this for a while. So I told you that this is as far as we're going to get today. Colossians 3, 18 and 19, wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord, and husbands, love your wives, and don't be harsh with them. And I think there's a number of ways we can start this series. Number one, we can have a theological argument about it. And I'm even sensing some of you in the room just, wait a minute, wait one minute. We are not going here. And you're lacing up the gloves and you're getting ready to fight. Okay. I don't think that's the hope for this series. But maybe some others of you just have a foregone conclusion about what you believe about all this stuff. And you know you've studied and you've wrestled it out. And so you know where you're at on this issue of husbands and wives. And, you know, the teaching might be compelling. It might be sort of entertaining. It might even be funny at times. And it might even be poignant for others. But it's not for me because I have a foregone conclusion about what I think about these matters. Thank you very much. Well, that might be you. and if it is, that's okay. And then the third category is that I think is true for most of us is this just opens up a reservoir of pain. If we're honest, maybe you're married and it's been a really, really rough marriage and you're in it and you're moving toward each other, but it's been really rough. Or you're in a marriage and you're not moving toward each other and it's been insanely difficult. the hardest thing you've ever had to go through. Or maybe you're not married anymore, and even hearing those verses, just, I mean, it's all you can do to stay in your seat right now and not run. Run. So if some of you need to run right now, now would be a good time. But the pain is huge. Or maybe some of you aren't married, have never been married, and that even brings up pain. maybe some of you are like I'm never getting married and I can give you 17 good reasons why I'm never getting married and still others of you have been married for like you know five minutes you're like what what what well here's the deal I think in in our culture we move into marriage in such an interesting way that needs to be said out loud because it's coloring our expectations. Tim Keller is a pastor in New York City, and he wrote a book about marriage, and I'm going to read you a quote from this book. And Keller writes this, quote, Some people in our culture don't see marriage as two flawed people coming together to create a space of stability, love, and consolation. Rather, they're looking for someone who will accept them as they are complement their abilities and fulfill their sexual and emotional desires. And this will indeed require a woman who is a novelist slash astronaut with a background in fashion modeling. Love that. And some of you guys are like, well, yeah. And the equivalent in a man. Well, Keller goes on to say, a marriage based not on self-denial but on self-fulfillment, will require a low or no maintenance partner who meets your needs while making almost no claims on you. And that's the rub, is that we want someone who will meet our needs and maybe shore up some areas where we're weak, but really will require almost nothing from us. Because when they start requiring something from us, that wasn't part of the package, that wasn't part of the program. and we may have made vows up on a stage like this one that said till death do us part and i'm for you but i often joke with with couples that that you know i sit down and i'm going to do their marriage and i go listen the vows i really want you to do are as follows i'm going to want to leave you i'm going to betray you in almost every way possible your breathing at times might make me want to vomit there will be days where i don't want to see your face but I'm not in this for what I can get. I'm in this for something bigger. That's a vow. But I think in our culture, the picture that I would have of most of our marriages is this picture right here. Two candles, not one flame that is burning bright, but two of them that are kind of flickering and one of them has to be above the other. They're always jostling to figure out who that's going to be. And it's cold and distant and separate. But the biblical picture of marriages really talked about in this one Hebrew word called echad. And we read about it in Genesis 2.24, and the man and the woman shall be one flesh, which is, again, a thing we hear in church, we hear at weddings, we go, hmm. But it's crazy. So how we understand it is found in Deuteronomy 6, 4. It's the Shema that Jesus himself would have recited every morning as he woke up. Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Same word. So whatever else marriage is, it's supposed to be a picture of who God is. And God has shown up in Jesus who came and he humbled himself and became a human being. and came as the servant of all. That's the picture of who God is. It's not the picture of what our marriages are like. So question, what does it mean to be two distinct people with one united heart? Because the worry I have when I think one flesh is I think, okay, now you're just gonna want me and my wife to become one person totally, one opinion about how finances should go, one opinion about how many times we should have sex in a given week. And yes, I just said that. one decision about where we should eat for breakfast. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What is two distinct people with passions and histories? What does it mean for them to start moving toward each other with one united heart? Well, this is a series that we really are going to be in for a number of weeks, so we're not going to say it all today. But as we start this journey, whether you're married or not, And it really is, I want to make that real clear. Whether you're married or not, here are the invitations that I would like to give you, that we would like to give you as we start this series. Number one, that you would pray a prayer. God, search my heart, not his or her heart. You know, there's a temptation that you're going to buy that CD and he will listen to it because I will put it in his car in the morning before he starts. Or she is going on, she's sitting right next to me, and that elbow is going to be, I mean, this is going to be an elbow-free service, gang. Elbow-free series. If you need to, maybe husbands, you can sit on this side of the room. Wives, search my heart, oh God, not him or her. Number two, what needs to be healed in me? That would be a great question to ask. No matter where you're at on the journey of issues with men and women, what needs to be healed in me? There's probably things that need to be healed in you. So what are those things that God might be able to gently move toward? Number three, where do I need to simply listen? This is going to raise all kinds of stuff that you think about. But especially if you're married. As you sit with your spouse, where do I just need to listen? And then number four, the invitation would be just to hold the mystery of this. That one man moving toward one woman and deciding to spend the rest of their lives together, that's a lot of mornings and evenings and fights and discussions and Christmases with the in-laws and all that stuff. That's a lot of life to be spent together. And it's a mystery that a man would move toward a woman and a woman would move toward a man. And we're not going to get all the questions answered. Could we hold the mystery? Could we hold it together and say, there are some things that we simply don't know, but we're going to uphold these things. And those of you who aren't married, what I would encourage you to do is even think about some of your married friends and just say, how can I help and bless? And some of you who are married and have single friends, one thing you can give them freedom is some of your single friends aren't looking for a spouse necessarily, so you don't always have to talk to them about, well, when are you going to find someone? You're so incomplete because you don't have a spouse. Blech! Hold the mystery of singleness. Some people are really okay being single, and it's really okay and fully whole and fully full of God and single, I'm doing great, and here we go. Don't need your help, thank you very much, unless I ask for it. So some, you know, can we be the body of Christ that believes that too? So, question, what does it mean to submit yourself to someone or something? And for that, I'm going to invite Jen Linwall to come up and teach. So, picture me in college. I was a junior in college I think and I was sitting in a college speech class next to a couple people I didn't really know and we were kind of making small talk and the guy next to me started asking me if I cook the meals at our house for my husband and I said you know I do but only if he's there because I don't know how to cook and he has to help me, he's teaching me and he kind of like got this sort of freaked out look on his face and he said well when I get married my wife's going to cook dinner for me every night. And she's not just going to cook dinner, she's going to cook all these different ethnic foods. She's going to be able to cook foods from different countries. So every night of the week it's going to be just like a different meal. And I was like, I am so sick of this kind of stuff. I'm so tired. I've heard this over and over and over. My place as a woman, my role as a woman, that I'm supposed to be a good cook because I'm a woman. And so I pushed back a little bit, and he said, you know, it says this in the Bible that women are supposed to do this. And I was like, buddy, you show me where it says that in the Bible. I did my usual thing. At this time in my life, I fought back. I pushed back. I was angry. I was confident. I was sure. My framing question around these verses was, how can I prove to everyone that it makes absolutely no sense for a woman under any circumstances to be required to submit to a man? How can I prove that I'm right about that and you are so wrong about that? I mean, I reduced this to a theological argument in which I had to be right. About a year later, I was in another college class and the professor threw out this question, is it okay for a man to care for children while a woman works? And I didn't have kids at the time. But, you know, the guys in my class just whip out their Bibles. And they're like all quoting these scriptures, scriptures we've all heard about men and women. And this one guy just raises his hand and says, you know, I just could never stay at home all day and do nothing. This is a direct quote. I'm not embellishing here. And he said, you know, God just did not create men that way. I mean, you stay-at-home parents out there are, like, ready to stand up right now. I know it. And, you know, I could feel this thing rising in me the whole class. And at that point, I just lost it. I had to leave the room, and I just broke down, like, sobbing in the hallway. I had to, like, lock myself in this weird stairwell for, like, 25 minutes, try to get it back together. And so anytime you have to leave a room of adults because you're sobbing uncontrollably, you just have to kind of reflect on that a little bit, right? Like, what happened in there? What happened to strong, sure-gen who could win any theological argument about men and women? Clearly, this theological argument touched something deeper, right? And it wasn't just an argument. There was a deep thing that just got ripped open that day in me. and it was about my fears. I had a fear that who I thought I was created to be wasn't okay and that the things that I wanted to do in my life I wasn't going to be allowed to do and that I was going to have to give power over to my husband and then he was somehow going to turn it against me and hurt me. I was really afraid. You know, the theological discussion of men and women in marriage, It mattered to me then and it matters to me now. It's a really important discussion for us to have. Because the pain and the shame that comes out of the misinterpretations of this passage are real. And they go deep for a lot of people. We have to be able to talk about that if we're serious about moving towards each other as a community. But if I can't emerge from that conversation for a breath and ask myself, why is it so hard for me to let go of control? What am I really afraid of? then I'm missing the point. Because no amount of winning a theological argument is going to heal the pain inside of me. It's going to take away the confusion I feel. This invitation that Paul gives it has nothing to do with who's in charge, who has the power, who gets to make the decisions. I think that making an argument that these passages are about a hierarchy misses the whole point. It reduces this passage from this really potent invitation that Paul is giving us. If you think back to the context of these verses of Colossians 3, he's been talking about this Christ who died, who rose, and saying to them, you did this with him. Your life is hidden with Christ in God. So all you do and all you say and every day, you're doing this in the name of Christ. so wives in the name of Christ submit abandon the need to be in control the need to be right the need to be first so you can experience the good that comes from letting go slowly release that death grip that you have on your life so that you can take a look at the world from a different angle one that's not about you and having things your way an angle that's about others that's about giving that's about loving, the angle that Christ saw the world from. And Ben's not the only person I'm supposed to do that with in the world. Paul says in Ephesians 5.21, he uses this same word for submit, but he talks about how all the believers need to submit to one another. And for me, in my home, where my truest colors show, that's a really great place for me to practice, for me to learn, for me to mess up and try again. Ladies, we have to experience the pain. We have to talk about the pain we've experienced in our family, in our churches, in our workplaces, in our communities, in our world, because we're women. And we all have different stories around this, and that's okay. Some of you are sitting out there right now, and you feel really settled in this. Some of you, it feels like we're ripping a scab off your arm. I mean, it's just so much pain. And we really have to be able to name that and talk about that to move through it. But healing is going to come from us really looking within. For us, moving beyond the pain into something more. And asking ourselves the question, why am I so afraid to let go? A few years ago, Ben and I had a chance to go on a date. And we had, I think, just one little one then, but it was sort of a rare chance that we had a whole evening uninterrupted. And so he was talking about ideas for our date. We should do something fun. We should go to a movie or we could play catch in a park. And I'm thinking, oh no, he doesn't know about my date to-do list that I have. About the things we have to do. We have to talk about our relationship. We have to talk about sex. We have to talk about whether or not we're being the parents we want to be. Our future. Our dreams. We got to cover that. So I said, look, we can be flexible, but whatever we do, we have to be sitting across from each other, like face-to-face talking the whole time. That's pretty much what I said. And it's pretty much what we did. And we talked about some of that stuff, and it was good. And it was fine. But we were in the car on the way home, and Ben said, kind of in a very kind way, you know, when's the last time we just had fun together? I don't remember. Do you? See, in that moment, Ben sensed something that we needed in our relationship, and I just couldn't see it. And I think I knew deep down that he was right, but I was so afraid of what would happen when I released control and when I didn't get to have my plan in my way that I refused to back down. And my refusal to back down had nothing to do with my theological belief about what Paul is or is not saying in Colossians 3. That's not the reason I refuse to release control. I'm really afraid of what's going to happen if I release control. What's going to happen in my life, in our marriage. It's a really scary thing. A lot of times on Sunday mornings, I'll get up. My daughter gets up really early in the morning, so I'll get up and I'll kind of get her dressed and hand her off before I have to come here. And so a couple years ago, I was getting her dressed and I managed to get jeans on her, but I didn't have time to change her shirt, and she was wearing this pajama shirt. It was, like, stained and, like, dirty, and had, like, spilled breakfast on it, and so Ben shows up, like, an hour later at church, and she's wearing the jeans and the pajama shirt. You know, he just didn't realize that I hadn't changed her top yet, and I'm, like, horrified. Like, you've got, I'm gonna have to go down to Sunday school. I have to drop her off and tell them. Like, I don't even know where this shirt came from. She shouldn't even wear this for pajamas. this is horrible. I mean, what are people going to think of me when they see her and they connect what she's wearing to me? See, handing over control in a marriage is so difficult because I am working really hard to create an image for everyone, for all of you, for everyone of what I want them to think is true about me. And when you get someone else in there and what they're doing starts to reflect on your image, which you're working so hard to manage, that's a really scary thing. And we do not want to release control. Because what if they do something that reflects poorly on us? Wives, submit your husbands, and you just might have a chance to stop running on the hamster wheel that is managing your image, so that you can embrace a deeper sense of community and relationship in your marriage. Second reason is hard to give up control. Because I'm usually right. You know, and it's funny, but don't we all kind of think that? Like, I actually, but I have a certain way of seeing things because they're right. And I'm afraid what's going to happen, you know, if I start letting you do things your different way, what's going to happen to our life? Everything might fall apart. right? So I don't want to give up control because I want things to be done the only way, the right way, my way. If you've ever been to a women's Bible study, you've probably had this experience. Somebody throws out a story of a time when their husband tried to do this ridiculous thing like pack the kids' school lunches, and he just had no idea what he was doing, and he put the most ridiculous things in there, and everyone says, ha, ha, ha, and then someone says, like, that's men for you, and we move on, So instead of asking ourselves the difficult question, why is it so hard for me to let my husband do something that I usually do and do it differently? Why is it so hard that my husband and I choose to dress our daughter in a different way? Why is it so hard to let go? Instead of doing that, women say that they're submitting to their husbands, but they've adapted and tried to grasp and grip and vie for any kind of power and control they can get in their marriage. by putting their husband in his place, to his face and behind his back every chance they get. You know, I have to have control over things because it's the right way. It's the only way. And if there's a different way and it's not wrong, have I wasted all this time and energy on carefully putting together my life and my systems and all the things I do exactly the way that I do them? I mean, it's a scary thought to think of how much effort could be wasted if my way wasn't the right way or the only way. But Paul says in Colossians 3, this relationship is not about being right or having your way. Ladies, let go of your need to control and dominate. Men, let go of your need to control and dominate. Take a step off this throne that you've constructed so you can look down at your spouse and put them in your place see them as your equal. Look to love and submit. Instead of planting seeds of fear and judgment and self-preservation which only lead to a marriage that's built on competition. Love, submit, lift them up and create an entirely different kind of relationship. Third reason it's hard to give up control and probably the deepest for me is I'm afraid what's going to happen if I put it all out there for Ben to see. You know, if I take my cards and put them all face up on the table and push them across, is he really going to be able to handle that? Because being vulnerable in that kind of way makes you open to a pain and rejection that is so scary. You think about Christ coming in human form, opening himself up to human rejection and human pain, experiencing death. and inviting us into living a life like he lived. But he did that so that we could taste and see the power of self-sacrificial love, the power it has to change us, to change others, to change the world. In the spring, my husband had a chance to go on a pilgrimage to Iona, which is an island off the coast of Scotland. And he was gone for almost two weeks. And we could only communicate by email. So it was the first time since we've been married that we just were going back and forth on email, and this kind of incredible thing started to happen. We started opening up in these emails and talking about our relationship and our hopes for the future, and towards the end of his trip, an experience that he had prompted him to write an email saying he wanted to take a step into further vulnerability in our relationship. And he wanted to do that. He wanted to start that process by sharing a story with me that he had never told anyone. And it had nothing to do with our relationship, but he had just kept it inside. And, I mean, do you guys have stories that you've never told anyone? And if you're married, would you tell your spouse that story? Because by doing that, Ben put me in a position of power over him by being that vulnerable. But something incredible happened in me and in us, in our relationship. It was an amazing, sacred thing. And I think I got a taste of what Paul is talking about in this passage. Wives, submit your husbands. Husbands, love your wives. Parker Palmer says, if we want to save our lives, we can't cling to them. We have to spend them with abandon. Imagine doing that in your marriage, living that way. You kind of have to be crazy. And you have to give up a lot of stuff. Fear, judgment, having it all together. Keeping the image that you want everyone to have intact. But you know what you find when you start to put off stuff like that? You find Jesus in that lowly place, in that vulnerable place, because Jesus' life and death and resurrection taught us that it's in the letting go and the giving up that we find true power. Not in getting big or even or being right or winning, but in laying it all down and loving and submitting. This is our invitation to true life. So ladies, wives, can we begin this journey willing to ask the question, why is it so hard for me to release control? Men, would you ask the same? Because doing this work in the most central human relationship of our lives is an incredible learning experience for us. It will form things in us. It will allow us to see the world in a different way, And it'll start to slowly snuff out that fear we all have inside that we're not enough. And in its place, it'll grow things like love and grace and dependence and selflessness. And we really need those things to live in this world together. And I think that's Christ's invitation to us all. So what would it look like to just hold that invitation, men, women, why is it so hard for me to give up control? To take that invitation real seriously. And then to consider if you're married that perhaps the most, in this paradoxical, mysterious way, maybe one of the only ways that you're going to learn how to give up that control is submitting to another human being. What if that's part of the mystery of one flesh? And it raises a question for me and maybe for you too. This question is, is submission just for wives? Maybe Paul says, wives, submit yourselves to your husbands. Well, maybe another question could be, okay, well, so is loving just for the husbands? Because it says husbands, love your wives. Well, in Ephesians, which is sort of a parallel passage, late in verse 4, Paul writes about what it looks like when a community of people begins to submit to one another. Be kind, he writes, and compassionate to one another. forgiving each other, just as Christ God forgave you. And follow God's example, therefore, as dearly loved children, and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us. Released control as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. And then Ephesians 5.21 is what Jen referenced when Paul writes very directly, Believers in Jesus all around the world, all across time, submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. So it's not just for wives. It's not just for husbands. This invitation is for everyone who would say, I don't follow Caesar as Lord. I follow Jesus as Lord. And the invitation is to submit to one another and release control. Which leads right into this next question. What does it mean for a husband to love his wife? As Paul writes in Colossians 3.19, Husbands, love your wives and don't be harsh with them. Well, if you continue on in that verse that I just read, submit to one another, Ephesians 5, 21 through 23. Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. This is a parallel passage to Colossians 3. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is head of the church, his body. Here we go. Of which he is the Savior. And now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. Now, hold the amens, fellas. Now, some of you are like, yep, I was hoping we were going to get to that verse. Because the husband is the head of the wife. And we can talk about submission, and submission is right because I'm in charge. And that's just the way it is. That's just the way. I mean, I didn't even ask to be in charge. I just am in charge. And so, every once in a while, I have conversations with guys about this, and they're having a problem in their marriage, and every once in a while, it's like, she just needs to learn how to submit, because I'm the head. And so I say, all right, let's look at Ephesians 5.25, the very next verse. Here's what it means to be the head. Husbands, love your wives. This is what it means to love your wife. Just as Christ loved the church, okay? How did he love the church? He gave himself up for her. And the room gets real quiet at that point. You want to know how to love your wife well and how to be the head of your marriage is to be the one that says, I will give myself up for you. I've never met a woman who has said to me, my husband, he gave up something he dearly wanted. for me that doesn't have a marriage that's moving toward each other. And I've never met someone, some husband or wife, that's like, yep, I'm in charge. My marriage is great. That the marriage really is great. Which is not to say that you might really believe that in the tradition you grew up in and what you've studied, that the husband is the one that's the leader. This is not the point. You can believe that, or you can believe in an egalitarian marriage. The point is, men, is how do you love your wife in a way that has nothing to do with authority? F.F. Bruce says this, this is not only a matter of affectionate feeling or sexual attraction, husbands, about loving your wives. It involves a husband's active and unceasing care for his wife's well-being. Active and unceasing care for his wife's well-being. The word head in the Greek is a Greek word called kephale. And what it means is, it does mean head, but in the sense that the head is the extremity of the body in the same way that the tip of a spear is the extremity of the spear or the mouth of a river, the source of a river is the extremity. It's the point that, it's the top of the wall. It's the point that goes first. It is this movie I saw, the quote that's up there, does Kefali in the best way that I've seen it. And it's this general who's leading his soldiers out into battle. And right before they go out there, the general says to the soldiers, listen, you guys, you guys need to know that mine will be the first foot on that field of battle and it will be the last foot off of the field of battle. It means I am fully engaged. It means I am all in. It means no matter what happens, I am not disengaging. I'm not leaving. I'm looking at you face to face, wife. I am all in. That's what it means to be the head. And so what it doesn't mean is you're a perfect husband. It doesn't mean that you know how to listen so well that you could write a book on listening well. What it simply means is that in that moment, husbands, where everything in you wants to disengage and you know the exact moment I'm talking about when the heat feels like it's getting turned up real high and almost without thinking, you start getting up, checking your pocket for your smartphone, starting to check your email and text, and you don't even know you're walking out of the room, but you're walking out of the room. Or you're not rocking out of the room, but your face and your eyes walk out of the room. You've just disengaged. You've just withdrawn. To be the head in this sense means, when I sense I'm doing that, and that will happen to you, husbands, that you say, hold on. I'm here. Honey, I'm here, and I'm in. And we may have to fight this one out, but I'm here and I'm all in. Husbands, what would it mean for you to notice when you're disengaging and to say, I'm putting down the smartphone and I'm going to engage? Now some of you may think if it's not about authority, then, you know, when push comes to shove, like, who gets to decide, right? I mean, when you have something that you can't decide on and you're fighting about it, who's going to decide? And I want you to notice the language up there. When push comes to shove, so that's where we're at, right? When push comes to shove, I think there's difficult decisions that you're going to have to make. I've been married long enough to have made very difficult decisions in my marriage. It's never gone well when one of us just says, Well, I'm ticked and we can't decide, so I guess you better do it. Because what happens in that way is like if I say, all right, you decide. But if you decide wrong, you'll pay. I'm just telling you, you'll pay. And then we call that love and submission, and it isn't. The biblical picture for marriage is not about authority. It's about unity. it's about one flesh so what Jen talked about two people showing up in vulnerability moving toward each other and I want to say it again even if in your biblical frame of reference you think one person should have authority over even if the call is to unity the call is husbands to give yourself up for your wives and wives it's the same call give yourself up for your husbands and in that way you'll learn about what it means to be one flesh in this picture of one bright flame two distinct people one united heart and now we can start holding the mystery because it's no longer about fighting for control and fighting for manipulation and fighting to get your way. When it's about that, it's not about one flesh. It's about making sure you get what you want and the way you want it. And we've all been there. So in closing, I want to give husbands, I want to give you a gift, and wives, I want to give you a gift. And that is, I just want to talk out loud about, number one, what most husbands are afraid to ask their wives. this is the question that most husbands will never ask their wives but it's dangling out there in every conversation and the question is this are you keeping a scorecard on me because it feels like you are and it feels like i'm failing but i'll never ask you that because deep within my wounding is a thing that wants to make sure i get everything right and so this gets played out on big stages and on little stages I remember just last Friday I did the grocery shopping and I went to Trader Joe's and got a bunch of stuff but like when I got home I remember kind of looking at Mary and kind of, okay please Lord let me have gotten everything right let me not have gotten the wrong spinach or the wrong the wrong lettuce or the wrong There was a time where I was at the grocery store, and there was the olive oil that she wanted wasn't there. So I'm like, oh my gosh. I mean, what, you know, so I'm taking pictures of different bottles of olive oil, texting it to her, and I mean, what should I do? I can't make this decision alone, for God's sake. I mean, I have to, you know, and it's olive oil, people, and I'm so concerned about getting it right. Well, play that out into bigger parts of your marriage. And so, wives, here's my ask on behalf of all husbands. Sometime this week, if it's authentic, you look them right in the eye and you tell them, this is what I appreciate about you. And when we do get something right, say thanks and say, I noticed that you took a little extra time and you did that thing. Because we're just kind of, at the end of the day, most of us are pretty insecure. and we're afraid that we're getting everything wrong. So it would really help to know that it's not about getting it right or getting it wrong. It's about moving towards. So I think this is what most wives are afraid to ask their husbands if they're really honest. And the question is this, do you really see me? And do you like what you see? am I as important to you as fill in the blank? Might be a job or a project, but it really gets down to, am I as important to you as you are important to you? Is what I care about, does that matter to you as much as what you care about? And honey, look at me. Look at me right in the eyes. Wives want to say to their husbands, I know I've changed over the years. How I look has changed. What I care about has changed. You've got to see me in my most vulnerable ways. Do you like what you see? But I think most women are terrified to ask their husbands that. For fear that at that moment the husband will disengage and move into the wall of silence goes up. so what would it look like husbands for you to look your wife in the eye your wife of 30 years and say you are beautiful and you delight me now don't say that if you can't say that but if you can look at this woman that you've been with for 30 years and say oh my goodness, I'm so lucky to have you in my life. I'm telling you, that would be one of the most beautiful things that you could do in your marriage. Flowers are great. That would be better. And you're going to do it so imperfectly, both of you husbands-wise. You're going to start awkwardly moving toward each other, and you know, this week even. Steve told me to tell you. I like you. You know, it's going to be awkward. And I'm just saying, the guys are probably going to do it worse than the women, all right? We're probably not going to get it as right as you will. And that, I hate to admit that even. But what if we tried? What if we tried to look at each other and cherish each other the way that Christ cherishes the church? The way that Christ loves the church and gave himself up for the church. What if we looked at each other that way? With all the flaws that are, let's not be, you know, dishonest about the flaws. So the invitations are this. As we start this series, and this is just the beginning of the journey, search my heart, oh God. And when I want to put the CD on his bed stand or just get the elbow out, remind me, God, search my heart, not him or her. And God, what needs to be healed in me? It might be big, it might be huge. How do I move toward healing in that? And who do I need around me? What resources do I need? And number three, where do I need to simply listen? Where do I just need to listen and just kind of shut up and listen to God or to my spouse? And then how do I just need to hold the mystery that this is so messy and hard? Doing a marriage well is the hardest thing I've ever done and the hardest thing I ever will do. Sometimes I think there's a sense that, oh, Jan and Ben, and they have this great marriage, and Steve and Mary and Dave and Bonnie, and they're just, well, if I had your marriage, it'd be awesome. You don't gotta be married to the guy I'm married to. Well, okay. Marriage is really hard and really messy. And doing it really well doesn't mean it's not really hard and there's not tons of conflict. So that's where we need to say, come Holy Spirit with grace. And we need to hold the mystery. That when two people start moving toward each other, the God in heaven that loves to see redemption will move toward you with gifts. Amen? Some of you could tell your story about how that happened in your marriage. The God of grace came and moved. And others of you said, that didn't happen in my marriage, and you need God's grace to flow right now. So, as we start this series as one body filled with single people and married people and children and grandparents, here's the invitation. Can we hold the mystery as one body, moving toward each other and submitting to one another, learning from Jesus about what it means to be the body of Christ. Let's pray together. God in heaven, bring grace to those of us who need grace for strength to build a marriage well. Bring grace to those of us who need strength to mourn over a marriage that was lost. Bring grace to those of us who have all kinds of pain about this men and women issues. Bring strength and grace to those of us who really do want you to search our hearts. In your name, amen. Thank you.
