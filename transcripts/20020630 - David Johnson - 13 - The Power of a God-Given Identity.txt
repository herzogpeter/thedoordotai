I'm going to ask you to gird up, as it were, in the scripture it says, gird up the loins of your mind, which essentially means hike up your pants and with decent respect lift your dress to a level that you can at least wade through deep waters, okay? And concentrate and focus on what God is going to be saying to us this morning. It's unpacking where we left off last week. And it isn't like a swift pace, but it's kind of a dense pace. So I'm going to just really ask you to focus in. Some of you may need to rebuke the spirit of slumber that's come upon you or something. And if I see this starting to happen, I'll just ask you to stand and clap your hands or something. Not that it's boring, but sometimes there are things at work that try to keep us from actually hearing the truth. So let's pray. Father, we do ask that there will be a quickening in us and that our ears will be unstopped and our eyes will be opened and that you will bring revelation to the amazing truth about who we are in you and the inheritance that we have. The promise fulfilled for us. Be in this place, God. Be exalted over us. In Jesus' name, amen. last week we were watching a people as they were wandering around in the wilderness and heading towards the promised land and they were having a great deal of difficulty embracing the new identity that God had given them remember he said that if they would obey his commands they would be his treasured possession they would be a kingdom of priests essentially you will be my beloved sons you will be my beloved daughters you will be a holy nation you will be this amazing kingdom of priests if you will simply obey enter in embrace the identity that I've given you and obey all the things that I command you and we stand at this pivotal point of looking and seeing are we going to observe or watch the Canaanization of Israel or the Israelization of Canaan the power was hanging in the balance God had given them this amazing new identity when he had drawn them from the place of enslavement delivered them through the Red Sea and brought them out it's a sad story because we had a delivered defeated people God miraculously delivered them but they never could come to a place of embracing their new identity and responding in obedience and they were a defeated people. So defeated that they died in the wilderness, never going into the place of promise. You can be delivered and defeated. It's a sad story. And a new generation came and they were willing to obey. They consecrated themselves and they took the steps of a risky obedience into that flooded Jordan River, God leading the way in the Ark of the Covenant. And when they stepped into the water, The water snapped back at least 19 miles. And they walked across. From the place of death, they came out on the other side in resurrected life. They were a new creation. The old life of the wilderness had passed away. Behold, all things had become new. And there they were, standing on the shores of the promised land. And they brought 12 stones out. The twelve stones from the place of death were mounded up to serve as a reminder to the generations that would follow of the amazing work of God bringing them from death to life. The power of God working on their behalf. Those stones were to bear witness to that reality. We're at a remarkable point in the history of our church. Every week now, we're either seeing videos or you're hearing announcements about going to Maple Grove, being a part of what God is doing, the new building, etc., etc. Let's not confuse, however, the new building with the promised land. The new building is not the promised land. Maple Grove is not the promised land. The new building is our pile of reminder stones. That's what it is. The building should remind us of God's rightly ordering work in us. It should remind us that God has brought us from death to life. It should remind us that from brokenness can spring a whole new creation. And it should remind us that obedience releases the power of God. And that the power of God destroys the work of the enemy and restores people. That's what that building should talk to us about. For us and for generations that would follow. It serves as our symbol to remind us of the power of God. It isn't the center of our life. It just reminds us of where our life comes from. And now this people, standing on the other side in the promised land, face their enemy. They are now toe to toe with Canaan. God leads the way around Jericho. The stronghold is destroyed. God is the victor and every living thing in Jericho is to be killed. with the exception of Rahab, who had acknowledged God. And they bring out the gold, the silver, the iron, and the bronze. They are the devoted things to God. What is dealt with in Jericho? Very, very clearly, God deals with three things that we are very familiar with now as a people. Sex, money, and power. The sexual temptation to intermarry was destroyed when God said that everybody was to be killed. He removed the sexual temptation to compromise with the Canaanites. He asked that the things of value be brought out, the gold, the silver, the bronze, and the iron, and they were to be fully devoted and offered to him. And the power to win this victory was totally God's power. And the amazing demonstration of God showed the people once again that no matter how big the enemy was, how strong they thought that that enemy was, God was always greater. His power could defeat anything the enemy set up. Sex, money, and power. And Achan disobeyed. Remember? A little bit of Canaan was already at work in him. The love of money and possessions was the root of his evil disobedience. He had already lost sight of the fact that God was the source. And that what came into his hands was resource. That was to be offered back to God. Hearing a familiar theme here. God was the source, and what came into his hands was to be offered back as resource. He lost sight that God would provide all of his needs according to his riches. There wouldn't be anything that he would lack, but he thought he had to hoard just a little bit back. He held on to what belonged to God, and he died. Some of you need to let that in. There's a place of death within you because you still are holding on to what belongs to God. God is the source. What comes into my hand is a resource. And when I give it and offer it devoted to God, there is life. There is freedom. God was working in the people and Achan had already abandoned his identity as a God-given identity. It was given as a new creation that had come from death to life. He was the blood son. He was a part of the kingdom of priests. He was a part of the holy nation, and he abandoned that identity. When the people of God obeyed, they were absolutely undefeatable. And when they disobeyed, even the most insignificant things like Heatville, remember AI, Heatville, had appalling power over their lives. Confession and repentance were the pathway back. God would not allow the Israelites to take on a new conflict until they had taken the lost ground and they returned and took the lost ground through the process of confession and repentance of reconcepting themselves anew and afresh to God of getting rid of the reality of Canaan within them we have this tendency to think about confession and repentance in a one-shot type of thing where we go, well, I know, I came to Christ and it's over. It's not a one-shot thing. This is a daily place of responding to God. A daily place of going with God and saying, what's in there? What needs to be cleaned out? What is there of Canaan that needs to be rooted out? And the children of Israel were to be in that daily place. This past week, it rained an awful lot in Wright County, some of you know that, but live out there. And I live right near Buffalo Lake, and I have a little sailboat on Buffalo Lake. And Buffalo Lake has gone up, up, up, up, up, up. It's over the bank, it's over the roads, it's just kind of gone over. And I went down, and I looked at my little sailboat that's moored at the buoy over there, and it was sitting a little low in the water. So Sandy and I went out yesterday, and we took that boat through a process of confession and repentance. And somehow, I don't know if it had the power to do this, but it lifted the flap of the little tarp that's to cover it, and it allowed something inside the boat that was supposed to stay outside of the boat. And so as we took that boat through the process of confession and repentance, a gallon at a time, the boat came up. See, in reality that boat doesn't care how high the water goes in Buffalo Lake It could be 20 feet over flood stage And my boat would be perfectly happy because it would float on the water Let a little water in that boat and I'm in trouble And this is what the children of God were beginning to discover That they could literally walk within the context of the enemy territory and be a victor. But if they allowed a little bit of the enemy's stuff to root in their lives, they started to go down. Is this simply an amazing picture for us to look at in the Old Testament? Is it something of history? Or are we actually watching the progressive revelation of God? And I would tell you we're watching the progressive revelation of God. And if we look closely at the picture, we'll see our faces in the picture. Let's do a quick bird's eye flyover. The voice of Moses is once again heard crying in the wilderness. John the Baptist comes, and he essentially is proclaiming the exact same thing that Moses was saying. Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand. Turn from your evil ways. Obey God and the promise of the kingdom. All of the blessings will be yours. John the Baptist is calling the people back to the rooted identity that they were supposed to have in God. And then, into the waters of the Jordan, walks the Ark of the Covenant. Jesus Christ, with the wall written on his heart. God seals his identity as he speaks down and he says, You are my son, in whom I love. With you I am well pleased. Essentially, it's the reiteration of what was said by God over his people. You are my treasured possession. I love you. and the new Israel lived in the very life of Jesus is a life lived in obedience to the Father one step at a time in fact if you were ever going to try to describe the very life of Jesus you could use two words the Father he went where the Father went he spoke what the Father spoke and he did what he saw the Father doing and it's no wonder that the very power of God flowed through him, that the kingdom of God was revealed through his life. He was tuned and aligned to the Father. He demonstrated the power of God over sickness and unclean spirits and the natural elements. And when he spoke the word, it rang with a degree of truth that the people had never remembered hearing before. They were in awe. And the broken who heard him were filled with joy. There was a life that welled up within them. But the lawless self-righteous wanted him dead. In Jesus, we see the new nation. We see the amazing royal priesthood. Now, is that it? Does it simply end with Jesus? Not at all. Peter captures this in 1 Peter 2.9 when he says, you we those of us here in this place are a chosen people we are a royal priesthood a holy nation a people belonging to God that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light out of darkness that place of lawlessness and disobedience into the wonderful light the place of living in obedience and in the full presence of God and the power of God. And to get the impact of this verse, it's just lost on us. As you know, Republicans, Democrats, and Green Party, and Independents, we don't know a thing about kings and priests. So we have to dig into this, and we have to look at it through Hebrew eyes. Because the moment a Hebrew person heard those words, royal priesthood, boom, two pictures would immediately snap into their mind. King and priest. So two things simultaneously. Now the job description for both of those are clearly lined and outlined for us in scripture. We have this vision of a king. And the vision or the idea that we have around kings is rather mythic actually. You need to look into scripture to find out what God defined as a king for his people. Because he was to be the king. Remember that. And so a king, an earthly king, had no legislative powers. They were never to rule over the people because God was to rule over the people. They were simply to steward the lives of the people, as it were. One of the words that is actually connected to king in the Old Testament is counselor. Wonderful. Counselor. Here are the connections there that the prophets were talking about Jesus would be. But here is this king who doesn't have rulership authority as it relates to the people, but he has leadership authority, and he's to lead the people in the place of defeating the enemy and tearing down places of idolatry. Remember when David was speaking a couple weeks ago, he was talking about in the spring when kings go to war. It was the standard job description. Let's go, mobilize the people, come on, we will go, I will lead you in victory, we're going to defeat the enemy, we're going to tear down the places of idolatry. And it should come as absolutely no surprise that the kingly power to defeat the enemy and eradicate idols was connected to nothing more and nothing less than full obedience to the law of God. As the king was obedient, victory was a given. this was so important in fact that a copy of the law was presented to the king now we kind of think okay I just got a book but they were remembered they had to copy this out and the law was kept in the temple but he was given a special copy so that he could meditate on it dwell on it that he could walk in the ways of God and obey defeating enemies and eradicating idolatry that was the king's job description what about the priests on the other hand priests were to act as mediators between God and man they offered sacrifices and ministry for the guilty now if I had a choice I would prefer to do the king's job versus the priest's job the idea of kind of going to war and having victory and tearing down the places of idolatry is somewhat energizing for me the priest's job was utterly redundant every day they would go to the place somebody would come with a sacrifice and they'd go come with me confess your sins sprinkle blood mediate thanks for coming next ok follow me confess your sins sprinkle blood mediate you're forgiven next number 25 now serving number 25 ok you over there over and over and over we have this image of the temple and it was beautiful by the way it was gorgeous but we have this kind of illusion it probably was more like the St. Paul's stockyards imagine all these people hauling in animals all day long burning flesh. Now that's a wonderful smell. And that's all they did all day long. Now there's a dilemma with that. It can become so redundant that it no longer means anything to the person who's standing there as the mediator. You can lose sight of a very important reality. They were standing in the very presence of God. They offered this service in the presence of God. The consecration of the priest was an amazing process and it's outlined for us in minute detail. One aspect of their consecration was that sacrificial blood was to be placed on the right earlobe, placed on the thumb of the right hand, and on the great toe of the right foot. Now I think this is ample evidence to show how significant right-handed people are in the sight of God. It's a little known fact, I'm pointing it out for you here, that those of you who are left-handed are grafted in by special grace. It's amazing. I mean, it couldn't get any stronger because Jesus even sits at the right hand of the Father. But it was a tedious consecration. There's something more than that that stayed here. It's a symbolic picture of the whole person coming under the influence of the blood. The whole person under the influence of the blood. Hearing. They were to hear and tune their best ear to God to listen sensitively for the voice of God. their hand was a consecrated hand and when it reached out and it took the sacrifice it was a consecrated hand that was there doing and serving God's people as God would serve his people and they were to walk in absolute obedience to God as the servant of God the whole of their life was to come under the direct alignment of God, to hear his voice, act on his behalf, and walk in his ways. We are kings and priests. And to live as kings and priests means that we too need to take the promised land. Now, the promised land isn't the building, it isn't Maple Grove, it isn't the Twin Cities, it isn't the United States of America, and it isn't even Israel. The land of promise that must be taken by the power of God is right here. The interior landscape of my life is where the great battle is being waged. This is the place that is Canaanized. This is the place where I exalt myself above God. In here is where idolatry takes root, where the law of God is despised, or at a minimum negotiated and fraud so that I can kind of live in the cracks and be comfortable with what I'm doing. Here is where the enemy is working to blind my eyes, stop at my ears where I won't hear the truth. And I have discovered over years of walking with God that even the most insignificant things of Canaan that are alive and living within me have great power to defeat me. And if left unchecked, they grow. They can sink my boat. Try as I might, I do not get beyond the place of my disobedience until I walk the pathway of confession and repentance, which is a daily pathway. It's the priest in me that keeps returning to the place of knowing that the sins in my life need to be dealt with a little at a time. A little at a time. We are a people who have crossed the Jordan. In other words, we've died to the old wilderness life. And now, because it has been buried, and we are a new creation, we can embrace this new identity. We can move from this place. Here's the Scott Bernstein paraphrased edition of Galatians 2.20. I have been crucified with Christ, and the wilderness life, the lawless self, no longer lives, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body comes under the rule of a brand new identity, the Son of God. And I embrace this new identity by stepping through the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. My life is now hid in Christ. It's Christ in me that is the hope of glory. The great exchange has taken place. Christ's life working and living in me, Just as the high priest and kings were able to stand or defeat the power of the enemy and tear down idols and stand in the presence of God and acknowledge sin, I can do the same. I can not only do the same within the context of my own life, but when I start to live out my life, that starts to happen through my life in relationship with other people. The very power of God, the very kingdom of God starts to flow through me. spend some time this week, I would encourage you and sit in the passage in Ephesians. Ephesians 1, 15-23, an amazing passage where Paul just gets rhapsodic. He's very aware of the Roman Empire and all the amazing things the Roman Empire has accomplished, but it still has brought a lot of death. And he sees a greater power, and he's captured by that. And he says, oh, that I may know him. I need the knowledge of him. And we sang about that this morning, that I may know him more, not intellectually, but that I may be in a place of intimate relationship, that place of formation where Christ is impressing his image on my life and I am responding back to Jesus Christ. That's what Paul is crying for in that verse. Jesus is the doorway to a whole new life, and I stand as a new creation. And then he goes on to talk about the hope, the riches, and the power that are there. What is the hope? It's the inclusion in God's future through the resurrection. This week we did the funeral of Kim Fisk, a dear friend to many of us, and I stood there and I looked at that coffin. I put my hand on that coffin as we were saying the last words over her. And I realized again the power of the blessed hope. It's not over. That exit is an entrance he is the resurrection and the life that's the blessed hope our future is expanding not contracting what are the riches we get to participate in the very kingdom of God God brings the kingdom into our lives and transforms our lives and we begin to live out at the expressed kingdom and how great is the power we can highly let it in what is this power? the very power that raised Jesus Christ from the dead that now is alive and working within me the spirit of Christ is the very same power that spoke the dawn over creation that took dust and made it come to life that spoke beauty into chaos that is how great the power is that is now at work in me I can't even begin to comprehend it It is so far beyond, many times, the place where I'm at. I still see myself as almost like the defeated delivered. Where I look and say, we're like grasshoppers. Instead of saying, God's in us. He's rising up. Greater is he that is in me. Yes! Dallas Willard points out how this power impacts our lives. I love it. In the Renovation of the Heart, it's an amazing book. You need to get it. He says, My emotions are now anchored in the reality that God loves me. Even catastrophic things that hit my life in the place of obedience can still work for my good. That's what Romans 8.28 is all about when it says all things can work together for good, to them that love God and are obeying God. Catastrophic things even work for us, and I don't have to depend on what my emotions are telling me. My will is aligned with God, and my love response is to say yes, and that starts to impact the way my attitudes, my motives, and desires are shaped. Jesus said in John 5.30, I seek not to please myself, but him who sent me. Even in the place of apparent defeat, I can say, nevertheless not my will, but thine be done. Should I live and death comes and knocks at my door, I would hope that when my box is rolled down the aisle, it could eventually be said of me, He did not seek to please himself, but him who sent him. In turn, my body does what is right. It just lines up. And it becomes the instrument of the manifestation of the very kingdom of God. People get to see the kingdom. My relationships change. God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world, but to love it back to himself. Jesus was a friend of sinners, but never a participant of evil. and suddenly my relationships are to go to a different place. The relationships in my home, the relationships with the people that I work with, my relationships with my neighbor, is to be in a different place because it is now Christ in me moving towards these people. And there are times when they are going to teethe me. And in those moments I can do the Canaan thing or I can say, Rise up, Jesus, rise up. This is not going to work otherwise. Rise up. Now when we move into the world with the basin and the towel, which we've been hearing about, we're like Jesus. Now that leads an impact. Remember how John described that foot washing scene. In John 13, 3-5, Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power. And that he had come from God and was returning to God, so he began to wash the disciples' feet. Jesus did not do this because it was his duty. He did this because it was love reaching out to his disciples. He didn't have to, but he wanted to. you can serve and not love but I can tell you this you cannot go into a place of being rightly ordered in right relationship with God and not love and serve the kingdom people know the power of love suddenly we are now people of power. Rightly ordered power. Power of God moves through us. Not for some egocentric recognition place but so that the kingdom of God can be extended through our lives. The incarnational reality that the great exchange has taken place, that Jesus is now living his life through me, becomes expressed through the way I do my life in relationship with the people that I'm in. Carefully listening, confessing and repenting, walking in the light as he is in the light, pulling down the strongholds of the enemy, not only in this interior land, but moving towards others. Then the same power that raised Christ from the dead will flow through us. We are on the threshold of some amazing places and times within the life of this church. If we can start to live into this identity in deeper and deeper ways, not that we haven't, but if we can go into deeper places with this identity, when we stoop to serve, people will look and go, I think I just saw Jesus. see that's what Jesus was saying when he said let your light let the light of God this light inside of you so shine that people would see your good works but they would do what they would glorify the father in heaven they would know that what transpired in that moment could not have come from nerdy geeky Scott Bernstein that was way beyond what he could come up with, they'd go, there's only one explanation for that. That had to be God. Because I know him. This is done happening now. The life of God flowing through the people of God manifesting rightly ordered the power of God influencing the world for the kingdom of God. and it doesn't end there folks see this is just the beginning of us living into our job description for all eternity Revelation 1 5 and 6 to him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and has made us to be kings and priests to serve his God and Father to him be glory and power forever and ever. Amen. It appears three times in Revelation as our new job description is entered into in a fuller way that we are entering into a place where we are kings and priests in the fullest sense of the way. We listen to Handel's Messiah and it's just chocked full of scripture and we hear that amazing song that says, King of kings and Lord of lords, and he shall reign forever and ever. Okay. And I used to think, King of kings. Yeah, he is. He's even King of queens. Elizabeth is underneath him, and all of these other people who are kings and queens are underneath him. And I mean, what's that to me? I'm not a king, I'm not a queen. I just thought, here I am, you know, it's hello. Who are the kings? King of kings. Who are the kings? This is where his rule and his reign is exalted. This is the place where he manifests his power. These are the people who are the holy nation. They're the royal priesthood that can show forth the praises of God who has called us out of darkness into his marvelous light. That's our identity, folks. That's why he came and delivered us. That's why he came and took us through the place of death, burial, and resurrection in Jesus Christ. And that's why he promised that his spirit would be sent to endue us with power. we have an amazing inheritance that we haven't even begun to tap into that we haven't even begun to fully embrace the identity that God has for us sadly I look across the American church of which I am a part of and many times it appears that Christians are far more excited about the fact that Jesus came for them than they are about the fact that he wants to change them and live inside them. This is where he wants to do his work. Well, I wish I had about four more weeks to explore this. And I'm just going to call babe and say, stay away for a while. No, not true. If you want to do a little bit more study, I would just encourage you to get a concordance and you dig out passages of scripture that says, in Him. Just start to look through all of the things that we are in Jesus. Staggering. Staggering. The work of God for us. it is staggering I would encourage you to let this word gestate inside that you would let the spirit of God rise in you pushing it to the top and there will be those moments of confession and repentance and there will be those places where he says tear down that stronghold demolish that idol come into full alignment with me respond and the power of God will be there he will be absolutely true to his nature in his word. Altar team will be here this morning to pray for you any need that you have. I'm going to ask you to stand. Amen. Father, we begin to understand in just little ways. If you landed on us with the greatness of what you have called us into, it would just blow us apart. But you bring us into this life. You draw us into this new identity. And I ask that you would continue to work through the power of your spirit in us. That we would be kingdom people who carry the basin and the towel. And when people see us, they go, there goes Jesus. Be exalted in our lives. Work in us. That your kingdom may come. That your will would be done. In our homes, our cubicles, our neighborhoods. The gas station, the grocery store. As it is being done in heaven. We are your people. We yield ourselves to you and we do say, we surrender. not for just simply a moment but for all time we surrender all that we are rise up in us in Jesus name Amen Amen.
