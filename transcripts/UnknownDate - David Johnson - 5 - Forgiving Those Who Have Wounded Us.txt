Well, it all began several weeks ago when, in the course of our study of the book of James, we came to James chapter 3, wherein we began a series of sermons that we've entitled, The Taming of the Tongue. In this series, we have begun to examine and we have, quite frankly, been marveling at the power of the tongue to do, among other things, three things. Number one, we've marveled at the power of the tongue to set the course of a life, into life or into death, verses 2 through 5. Number two, we've marveled at the power of the tongue to damage people, verses 6 through 8. And most recently, we've been marveling at the power of the tongue to reveal what's at our root. What it is that's driving what we say. In fact, the analogy we've been using is that a fire, literally, We've marveled at the power of the tongue to reveal that we do indeed leak flammable fuel and where we leak flammable fuel. Now, this analogy of flammable fuel came to us right out of verse 6 where James likens the damage that a tongue can do to a fire. For the tongue is a fire, a fire that is ignited by hell itself, he says at the end of verse 6. Now, we have been careful over these weeks to note that the role of hell in igniting this fire is only this, to light the match. Hell has no power to move your mouth. Hell has no power to move my tongue, to by itself burn down the forest. But if that little insignificant match, which hell is incessantly lighting, happens to find the leaking, built-up fuel of my hurt feeling, of my insecurity, of my arrogance, or my stored-up bitterness, a fire is ignited. It works like this. The match is struck. It finds my fuel. A fire is ignited. The tongue is engaged and fueled by fire. If my tongue is engaged, damage will be done. Sometimes explosive, sometimes never explosive. Slow burn, heats everybody else up and the fire is spread that way. Now if we come to a point where we see the damage we have done with our mouth, we usually are sorry and say so, followed with this trailer. I didn't mean it, I really didn't mean it. To which James in verses 9 through 12 of chapter 3 says essentially this, I'm really glad you're sorry, but please do not say you didn't mean it again. For the fact is this, that word you said came from somewhere. That slander you spread, that rumor you couldn't keep to yourself, that half-truth, that embellishment of truth came from someplace. It says that in verses 11 and 12. For a fountain, verse 11, is incapable of producing sweet and bitter water unless there really is something bitter in there somewhere. Verse 12, same thing, a different way. A fig tree is incapable of producing an olive. So I got news for you. If an olive shows up, that tells me that mixed in somewhere in the authentic fig tree is the root of an olive. The question of the day that has been driving our thinking, therefore, for the last couple of weeks has been this. Are you willing to wonder, then, about the root? Are you willing to wonder what's at the core of what's driving your mouth? Are you willing to wonder, getting back to the fire metaphor, are you willing to wonder what's fueling your fire? Are you willing to wonder where it is you leak flammable fuel? Well, we have identified two places so far from which we all leak flammable fuel. The first is this hurt. Just ordinary, everyday, hurt feelings kind of hurt Specifically the kind of hurt that happens when we don't get our way And few things, we've noted, have more power to release flammable fuel into our spirits Than when someone like our spouse or our boss or our teacher, coach or the agent at the ticket counter Says one very flammable word to you or me That word is no James 4.2 says it this way You lust, not sexual necessarily You just want something really bad And you do not get what you want And so you commit murder I would never commit murder With your mouth You can commit murder You are envious You cannot obtain You didn't get what you wanted So you fight and you quarrel The cause of the leak Is simply this That we are people relentlessly and obsessively committed to ourselves to my agenda, my way, my plan and very few things have more power to reveal our obsessive commitment to ourselves than when someone says to us no second place from which we commonly leak flammable fuel is historic hurt far beyond the irritating though very flammable reality of a frustrated agenda, we began dealing here with deep wounds of the soul, unhealed. My thesis around this is this, that unhealed wounds, unforgiven sin, undealt with hurt, poisons the heart. And a poisoned heart will poison your tongue. You may be a wonderful person in many respects. You may be redeemed. You may be involved in the ministry. You may be gifted. Gifts of the Spirit flow through you in marvelous ways. You may be growing in the Lord. You may be effectual in ministry, but if you have wounds undealt with, hurts that have not been healed, you will from that place leak flammable fuel. You may try to seal that thing off. You may try to forget about it and just put it in your past, but if you haven't dealt with that thing, that wound is going to leak noxious fumes, flammable fumes. Sooner or later, they'll sneak out from under the door and show up somewhere in your life. For the fact is this, from our wounds, we wound. From our hurts, we hurt. From those places that we have been sinned against, we sin against. The question we raised then last week that I left you to deal with, kind of as an assignment, and said we would deal with it again this week was this. Is there a way to shut off the gas? Well, I suggested four things to begin that process that this week I not only want to teach, but I want to do. Kind of as a congregation to do it together. The first was this, to involve, to invoke, to invoke the name of God and to invite the presence of God into that wounded place. To invite the presence of God, invoke the name of God into that very place that you might have sealed off, that you're very afraid to go, that you have even maybe become convinced is somehow unhealable to invoke the name of God, to invite the presence of God. Maybe for some, before you can even invite God into that wounded place, you need some revelation about what the wounded place is because you see the behavior, you see the flammable stuff, you hear the things come out of your mouth, it's shown up in your family at your work, but you honestly don't know where it's coming from. And I invited you to ask God into that, asking Him for some revelation about where it is from which you may leak. Second thing was this, that we take that which the Spirit reveals and declare it. That is to acknowledge it, admit it. Say out loud the source of the wound and maybe even the one who inflicted it, Not for the purpose of assigning blame, but for the purpose of moving forward into healing. Beyond the false security of denial. And denial, by the way, on the front end, does indeed give you some security. Denial, especially if the wound that is still festering in your spirit came when you were a little child. Shutting that off into a room so that one day maybe as an adult you could heal with it saved your life. Now you're 35, 45. That denial of that pain and the security that it provides is a false security. Moving past that, but past also the false power of blame. See, some of us get into our recovery and we uncover the wound and we look at it and we thought we were so scared to death. And what it is that empowers us to even deal with this wound now is to become very angry. and you probably never felt stronger in your whole life than all of a sudden unempowered with this anger and you surround yourself with it and you're really angry at this guy and you need to be and it saved your life on the front end. But I'm here to tell you, it is a long term, that is a false power to move past the false security of denial then to move past the false power of blame into real freedom, into real honest to God healing. But to move fully into that, two more things are necessary, I believe. The third thing in the list of four would be we need to repent it. Repent it? What do you mean these are wounds done to me? Repent not the wound done to you. The wound done to you is not your fault. It was done to you. little side thing here. Some of the wounds that we are dealing with, some of the wounds that you're struggling with right now, in truth, weren't done to you. They were self-inflicted wounds. We have self-inflicted wounds. There are consequences that some of us are experiencing right now that feel very much like wounds, and I'm trying to blame a lot of other people, but the fact is this. I've shot myself in the foot. I want you to know that there is grace for that. and there's healing for that even in this service today that's not the focus today talking about those of you who have had something done to you you do not repent of the wound done to you but the ways that to that wound you have responded is where our repentance needs to live for from our wounds we wound and that's where I've got to do my work and from our hurts we hurt and from our places, those places where we have been sinned against, we sin against. But I believe for us to authentically do that, we need to do something before that. And it's weird because this fourth thing in the list is in some respects what I think needs to be done before we can do number three, that is repent. And that is this, in order to genuinely repent, we need to come to a place where we can authentically forgive. Forgive him, forgive her, forgive them. And at least for a while, I want to, as I enter into this, even lower my voice. Calm down. Because for some of you to even consider forgiving him, her, them, we're treading now on some very, very scary ground. You want me to forgive? Do you have any idea what he did to me? Do you have any idea what she, what they did to me? In fact, Dave, you know, you're a good guy, but for you to even suggest that I should forgive him or her or them simply tells me that you don't know my story. For the fact, Dave, is this, that it has been my inner rage and it has been my unforgiveness. I hate to say that. I am a Christian. I love the Lord. But in this particular case, it has been my rage that has protected me. In fact, there was a time it saved my life. And to you, I want to say this. I know. And I would agree with you that there probably was a time where the only way you could have survived that wound in that family, in that system, in that whatever it was, was for you to get some strength. And it came from anger. But here's who I want to talk to for just a moment. Those of you who found some anger to deal with the wound and you protected yourself with that, and rather than use that for a while to survive what could have been a fatal kind of thing, emotionally or spiritually, even physically. It has now become your way. It has now become your way. It has now become the way you protect yourself. And now that inner rage is devouring you. And you know what else you know? It took some years to see this, but now it's not only devouring you, but it's beginning to damage, not beginning. It has been damaging people that you really love. You know what? Your anger is no longer damaged. It never did damage the guy or the woman who did the hurt to you. It never did hurt them. But now it's spilling out on people you really love, like your beloved wife, or your dear husband, or your wonderful children. And in fact, in ways that would make us cringe, we are indeed, through our rage, becoming very much like the people who wounded us in the first. That's a hard one to look at. We find ourselves in prison. Stories told of Corrie Ten Boom who years after her experience in the Nazi concentration camp met one of the especially cruel guards, apparently near his death, who in this meeting had the audacity to ask of Corrie Ten Boom what most of us would consider the unthinkable. He asked her for forgiveness. Forgiveness. You want me to forgive you. Why? Why should I? How can I? Lord, help me. At first, it felt wooden. It felt fake. It felt cold. She extended her hand to this man. I can't do this. as she stretched out her hand emotions began to stir the spirit of God began to intervene tears began to come tears turned to sobbing I forgive you to forgive she later said is to set a prisoner free and then to discover that the prisoner was you. But, what if the person who wounded you isn't sorry? Dave, that's a nice story about Corrie Ten Boom. And it is amazing that God gave her the grace and it probably was some supernatural ministry of the spirit that empowered her to do that in an authentic way. But you know what? She at least got it. And I'm sorry. Please forgive me. She was dealing with somebody as heinous as that was who at least acknowledged their sin. What if they don't see it? What if they never acknowledge it? My dad has never. My mother has never. I'll tell you something, Dave. The guy who did what has wounded me and is still leaking noxious fumes is in jail. sorry sorry you know Dave it was a good story I don't want to blow this whole thing up but where's your sentimental story for that context where is your model for forgiveness in that kind of scenario when they don't want forgiveness and they don't own what they did well here's the truth about that, I have no sentimental story for that one. And I have absolutely no model for that kind of forgiveness, but one. In fact, to see this only model that there is of this kind of forgiveness, you'll have to join me now at the foot of the cross, because that's the only place you'll see it. until what's modeled there begins to infuse the life of his people. Consider now with me the cross of Christ. Stand with me now at the foot of the crucified one. Abuse, that word that we embrace as being consistent with our experience, seems far too weak a word to describe his suffering. falsely accused, horribly slandered, abandoned by his friends. Judas betrayed him. Peter denied him. Disciples in their fear scattered alone. He was tortured and executed. People in the middle of his pain took pleasure in his pain. That is not a hard scene for some of you to have in your mind, not even as it relates to Christ, but as it relates to you. In your pain, someone taking pleasure in your pain. Hear now, these astounding words to the very people who were taking pleasure in his pain at the very time it was happening. Words beyond human effort. Father, forgive them for they know not what they do. Now, for our healing and for the power to forgive, move with me at the foot of the cross, observing the crucified one. Move now beyond amazement that on the cross he could say those words, Father, forgive them. Move even beyond gratitude that on the cross he could speak forgiveness because the gratitude would come because part of what he was bearing on that cross was my sin and yours. But move beyond amazement and move beyond gratitude, especially with your wound. Now move into identification with him in his suffering. With your wounds, at the foot of the cross, observing your sovereign in his pain, identify now with him. Sounds kind of weird to some of you. Not weird. This is true, profound, and accurate, deep theology. I think it's part of what Paul meant in Philippians 3, verse 10, when he said this, The passion of my life is this, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings. I want to enter into spiritually what it meant to suffer with Christ. Being conformed to the image of his death. Now about a year and a half ago when we preached through Philippians chapter 3, I indicated what it meant to be conformed to the image of his death. And we learned that it did not mean Paul had some masochistic desire to be nailed to a cross. His desire was not to die the way Jesus died. Aspiring to spikes in his hands. His aspiration, his passion was this. I don't want to die the way he died. I want to live the way he died. And he died, he died forgiving the unforgivable. Beloved, extending forgiveness at that kind of level. When you are dealing with a wound inflicted, nobody's saying they're sorry, nobody's owning their stuff. to extend forgiveness at that kind of level, hear me now, is literally, I believe, entering into the sufferings of Christ. It is literally an opportunity for you to enter into the very cross event, to enter into the very experience of Christ. Though it is a thimble full only of what it was he suffered, you are entering into the fellowship of his sufferings. but as you even consider that possibility as you allow that image and that reality to possibly dawn on you for the first time hear also the good news that it is precisely from or out of the fellowship of his sufferings and pressing through the cross events that we begin to experience the power of his resurrection through the fellowship of his sufferings. We press through into the very resurrection of Christ, the very life of Christ, where we discover, maybe for the first time in our lives, something that white-knuckling it and just trying to do it because we're supposed to could never do. We enter into the resurrection power of God where real healing is and where the power to forgive is and where we for the first time in our life very possibly discover the power to turn off the gas. I wonder if this that we're speaking of this morning is at least part of what Paul meant when he said things like this, I am crucified with Christ. I enter into the sufferings of Christ. I identify with him in his sufferings. and as I identify with him in his suffering and death, I press into my sovereign Lord, my own suffering and my own death. Nevertheless, I live. Not I, but Christ who lives in me lives. 2 Corinthians chapter 4, amazing, amazing self-disclosure we find there of Paul as he opens up his heart and shares with us the pain of his life and example after example after example of the tortures, literally, of his life for the cause of Christ. And in the 10th verse, he says this. Here's my life, how it feels, always carrying about in my body the dying of Jesus. The dying of Jesus was, to Paul, a present thing. So was the resurrection. But the dying of Jesus, I carry it about. I identify with him in that. so that the life, the dying I identify with, I carry it in my body, I identify with him in that so that the life of Christ, resurrection, power of Christ may be manifested through me as well. Some of you may not be able to relate to this, have no struggle with this at all, but being an evangelical, The symbol of Christ on the cross is a symbol that has been kind of taken away as a viable symbol. The thinking that I've always heard all my life is anybody who would relate in any way to the symbol of Christ on the cross is somehow denying the resurrection. I would pray that God among us would resurrect for us the power of the symbol of Christ in his suffering. Picture it this way, if you will. Christ, in his dying, on the other side, there is no Christ. He is resurrected. Through his suffering, we come to resurrection. But it is at the cross, in his suffering, that I identify with him. It is at the cross, in his suffering, that I bring to him my wound, that I bring to him my sin, that I bring to him my suffering. And at that cross, I identify with him. But more than identify, I press into his very dying, the wound I cannot bear. For by his stripes I am what? Healed. And in his dying, he said something I can't in my flesh say, Father, forgive them. And as you even consider the possibility, something in your humanness has got to shudder. Oh, if I let go of that. If I let them off the hook. Only way I know how to do this is to identify now with your sovereign Lord. As he suffers. And know that through that suffering comes resurrection life. To turn off the gas. Love your enemies, said Jesus. Something in us, if we don't understand from where that's coming, has got to say, easy for you to say. But if I stand at the foot of the cross, it's not easy to say anymore, is it? You meant it, didn't you? bless those who curse you well it's easy for you to say sitting at the right hand of God up there safe in heaven and then I sit at the foot of the cross and I see my sovereign in his suffering and I go it wasn't easy for you to say you meant it didn't you and you call me to that don't you and it's not just a magic wand is it it's entering into your very suffering and it's to tell me you know how scary this is and how much it hurts. To authentically forgive the unforgivable, I believe, requires men and women of living faith to by faith stand at the foot of the cross and move past amazement and move even past gratitude into identifying with your sovereign in his suffering and in his victory as well, for through his death he came to light. Impressed powerfully on me last week was the need to go beyond preaching this to doing this. The million dollar question was how. There were only two things clear to me and they are clear to me as well. The only way I know how is to do two things. Number one, to invoke the name of God and to invite the presence of God in a manifested way. To come and empower us to do some work together as a congregation. I'm going to ask the altar team to come right now, right now as I speak, and take your place up front. As they come in addition to them, I'm going to ask any of our staff or elders, or a number of us that we indicated would be able to do this, and I want you to come right out of the bleachers or wherever you're sitting and stand up and begin to surround our congregation. Staff and elders, you kind of know who you are. All staff. And surround our congregation. And as they do, let me just give you some instructions and tell you what we're doing here. The altar team up front is here for anybody as we move into this ministry time who needs prayer. And some of you, maybe many of you, will have a sense of that. You're not able to walk through this by yourself. Some of you, I want to encourage you to just be, God can meet you where you are, and some of you, I encourage you to just join with people who you're with. The people around the side are not there for you to go to for prayer. They're not going to be offended if you do that, but that's not why they're there. They're there simply to intercede for you. Some of them, in fact, I want to give you some instructions who are surrounding. Some of you, I want you to be extending your intercession up toward the bleachers. Some of you are out here. But basically, they're just praying for you. They're just praying for you that the Spirit of God would free you up to receive the gifts He's got for you. And those who need individual prayer can receive it. With the suffering of Christ before you, in your mind, what I want you to do is something that might be very frightening at first. I want you to bring that offense, that wound and that sin. Make it less abstract than that. Bring that person. Bring his or her name. Bring that parent, mom or dad, that child, that stranger that you've never seen since. They did what they did. That ex-spouse. And bring that person and that wound with you to the foot of the cross. and in your suffering identify now with your sovereign king move past identification now and press that wound into your sovereign king with that in mind I want you to stand I'd like to pray with no words of power born of clear articulation I come to you simply to invoke your name what a name I, we we invoke your name the name of the Father, the name of the Son, the name of the Holy Spirit, we invoke your name. Without your name, upon this time, we will not have strength to enter into the work we have to do at the foot of your cross. Beyond your name, we invite your presence. Even as I say that, we acknowledge your presence already here within us and in this place. But dear Father, by your Spirit, in Jesus' name, we pray for manifested presence. We pray for your hand to move, for your wind to blow, for your will to be exerted in this place. And now, beloved, with the suffering of your sovereign Lord before your mind than I. I want you to bring that offense. It's hard to look at. It's hard to even touch. It's hard to name. I want you to bring that wound. I want you to ask the Spirit of God even now for some of you to maybe now go to that room you've sealed off. Holy Spirit of God, They can't open the door. They're too scared. They've boarded it up so well, they can't get it off. Holy Spirit of God, move with power now to open that door. Hold them. Holy Father, hold them as literally the noxious fumes of that sealed off wound is now exposed to their own senses. Hold them. hold them go beyond the abstract of a wound to the person who inflicted it hard to look at him hard to even acknowledge her or them and bring them now to the foot of the cross where you see your sovereign bearing in his body your pain. Identify with him. Find some powerful comfort in the fellowship of his sufferings. But know that in your suffering and in his suffering, the point was not to suffer. The point was to press through that into healing, into life, into resurrection life. So take now that person and that wound and that offense and press it into your sovereign who will absorb it. It may sound weird, but some of you might even hesitate to do that. If you've got a clear picture of Jesus and his dying, you might have a very human thing about, I don't want to give him more. Oh, that's why he's there. That's why he's done what he's done. to absorb it, to take into himself what you cannot absorb. Give it to him, he will take it. He has taken it. He has taken it. You release it. He has already dealt with it. You release it. In Jesus' name. you
