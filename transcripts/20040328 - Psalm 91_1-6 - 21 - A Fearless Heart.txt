Good morning. My name is Al Shuck. I'm the pastor of Youth Ministries here at Open Door. You may know that I did this deal just a couple weeks ago. I stood here and did this. It's a lot of work putting these things together. It's like, wow. It's like, I was a little stressed. And I was thinking, there's got to be other ways. There's got to be another way. There's got to be other options. do you know you can buy sermons on the internet? They're ranging anywhere from $3 up to $20. And I didn't go with that option because you guys would have got a $3 sermon. And I started thinking too, it's like that would be a little deceptive. I mean, who would stoop so low to steal someone else's sermon? It wouldn't make any sense. Let's get started. I think most of you know that we've been involved for several weeks, even months, in what we have been referring to as a journey apart. Using the life of David as our guide and while there are many areas of David's life where life, where life, where life, where life, where life, where life, where life, where world. That's a problem. Okay, so we don't have an internet sermon. We can't do that. Honestly, there is not a message in the world I would rather give to you than the one God laid in my heart this week. So I'm glad we could have fun, but let's step into it now together. Let's pray before we do. God, thanks for the gift of life and just that we can know that you are a God who genuinely loves us. God, you are intimately involved in our lives down to the very number of hairs on our head. And I pray for freedom this morning, freedom to receive what you have for us, that we could open ourselves up. And God, I pray that you would bring freedom to us. in the name of Jesus, amen. Honestly, I was here a couple weeks ago and we're in what's called the journey of the heart. And if you were here, you know that I spoke about following after God's heart, pursuing God's heart. And part of what I said was that if we look at the life of David, it's not just about learning or studying the life of David, it's about experiencing the God of David. That we, you and I, could come to the place David came in Psalm 63 where he said, oh God, you are my God. That it's a personal relationship, very intimate thing. The way I said it was, we can't just look at his pictures, we have to take the journey ourselves. That's, you know, if you weren't here, I don't know if you were here that weekend, if you weren't here, boy, I just encourage you to buy this CD. It was a powerful message, powerful message. I haven't checked, but I'm sure there's a huge demand, and so there's probably a back order, but just be patient. At the end of the message, I told a story. And the story had to do with a prayer that I've been praying over and over again. A prayer of turning back to God, centering myself in God, keeping my focus on God. And I shared with you one phrase from that prayer. It was the phrase, I give you this day all my fears. I then told a story about how I had come face to face with one of my big fears, the fear of death when my Jeep was run off the road by a semi-truck. And I need you to know that there are other reasons why I pray that prayer. It's not just the biggies, like the fear of death. You see, I've got all kinds of fears. Fear surrounds me. There are so many things to be afraid of. It's like, and not even just the big things, but sometimes those little things that just kind of gnaw at you, just kind of eat at you. You just kind of take them with you, and they go with you all through your day. Those actually become what we call worry and anxiety. One writer said that worry is fear that has unpacked its bags and signed a long-term lease. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. It's like kind of with you. It's just there. It's part of your life. It's always with you. It's so easy to live that way. It's so easy to just go through life and have that as our experience. It starts at an early age. I have a daughter. Do you know that I have a daughter? That's my little girl right there. If you were here last Sunday night, our new worship pastor, Joel Hansen, did a concert, and he took it to a whole new level, man. He brought his daughter out on stage. So if you've got a problem with that, you've got to do it. On stage. It starts at a young age. She's 18 months old, and I catch myself constantly saying two words because now she's learning how to climb, and she's running all over the place, and she's still trying to figure the feet thing out. And when I see that she's headed toward danger, I constantly say these two words. What do I say? I say, be careful. Be careful. It's like I'm saying it all the time. She's not scared. I'm the one that's scared. And, you know, it would be irresponsible for me to not do that. It would be irresponsible for me to not step in sometimes. But I'm also aware that I could raise her in such a way that I would have her so scared of all the things that could potentially happen to her in life, some of which will. You walk that line as a parent. As a parent, it's tough. As a parent, sometimes you don't even realize what you're saying. As a parent, it just happens. If you sit too close to the TV, you're gonna wreck your eyes. You don't turn that stuff down. You're gonna ruin your ears. You cut your legs off with that lawnmower, don't you come running to me. you don't quit goofing around with that stick you're gonna poke an eye out i'm 34 years old i meet a lot of people i have yet to meet anyone who poked out their eye goofing around with a stick when they were a kid now i'm sure it happens i mean it must but the way we talk about it, it's like it's as common as the flu or something. I don't know. I mean, it's a fine line as a parent. It's tough. It's tough to know what to do. But you can see how as an adult, we can just be fearful and worry and anxiety and just constantly, constantly at us. We live in a culture of fear. Crime is up. Stock market's down. We're losing the ozone layer. Toxic waste, pollution, gas prices, what if someone breaks into my home, what if I don't get along with my new boss, there's identity theft, computer viruses, global warming, what if I fail this class, there's West Nile virus, anthrax, SARS, salmonella, Ebola, uninvited relatives, there's so many things, so many things, there's being audited, the election that's coming up, nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, power outages, where did I put my keys, I'm going to run in late, My mind has food poisoning. I need to work out, but thousands of people get hurt every year at health clubs. It's safer to stay on the couch. Sometimes I worry that I'm worrying too much. There's monkey pox, chicken pox, mad cow disease, any other animals we want to blame. It's out of control. It's out of control. One of my, a person I love to read, a humorist, Dave Barry, says this. He says, all of us are born with a set of instinctive fears. There's the fear of falling, fear of the dark, fear of lobsters, fear of falling on lobsters in the dark. And most of all, we're afraid of these simple words, some assembly required. It's out of control. One psychology class, they went out and they found 500 people. And they gave them a pen and paper, and they said, you know what? Write down your fears, your worries, your anxieties. Write them down. Those 500 people came up with over 7,000 fears, worries, anxieties. It's out of control. I did one check on the Internet. Over 500 phobias came up. And I thought, you know what? Let's do a survey right here. I'm going to read the phobia. You raise your hand. All right? Don't worry about what anyone else is saying. Those in the balcony, raise your hand. We won't look. I'm going to read them. Now, these are big words. I might struggle, but I'll do my best. Archibutaphobia. That's the fear of peanut butter sticking to the roof of your mouth. I'm not seeing many hands. I got one here that might get a few more hands up. There's defective calisophobia. That's the fear of painful bowel movements. That should get several hands. If it doesn't, there's a problem here. Who isn't? I mean, it's crazy. There's tetrophobia. That's the fear of giving birth to a monster. And there are some parents of three-year-olds going, it's not a fear, it's a reality. All of you are suffering right now from what's called homilophobia. That's the fear of sermons. And you should be fearful. There's one called pupophobia. That's the fear of puppets. And I'm going, what would someone have to be thinking to be afraid of puppets? Fear of puppophobia. There's quadrophobia. That's the fear of four-way stops and knowing who's supposed to go next. Which is easy. I'm supposed to go next. There's sesquip... sesquip... sesquip... It's the fear of being able to pronounce long words. I created one of my own. I figured 500 is not enough. I made allophobia. That's the fear of dirty laundry, smelly diapers, and the vacuum cleaner. I tell my wife I'm hooked. I'm suffering from it. I can't do anything about it. That's just the way it goes. You know, we can laugh. We can laugh, and we should. I mean, that's part of the reason I picked those, because they were kind of funny. We can laugh at those. but there were a number of things on that list that I didn't laugh at. Instead, I stopped and I went, I see those fears when I look in the mirror. Those are very much a part of my life. And fear surrounds us. I'm not going to read any more big words, but try some of these on. the fear of expressing your opinion, the fear of imperfection, and the fear of making decisions, the fear of being laughed at or the fear of rejection. There's the fear of being yourself, the fear for failure, the fear of being forgotten or ignored. There's the fear of being alone. See, whether it's the fear of death or the fear of losing your job or the fear of being alone. Fear is a real thing to us. We experience it. And right in the middle of our fear-crazy lives and this fear-obsessed culture, God speaks. He speaks to you and he speaks to me and he says two words, fear not. There's not a command more often given in Scripture. Not even close. Fear not. From cover to cover. It says do not worry. Do not be afraid. Be strong and courageous. Do not tremble. Fear not. God's calling. God's calling you and I to have fearless hearts. That's part of the journey of the heart. is to have a fearless heart. So are you saying that I'm supposed to step out into the middle of the highway and not be afraid? No. There is a fear, like as a parent, there's a fear that's a healthy thing, that's a good thing. But most, I think, or at least many of the fears that grip you and I, the worries, the anxieties, those are things that at least, at least keep us from experiencing some of the best things in life. At the worst end, they paralyze us all together. but at least they keep us from experiencing some of the best things. One writer that I found said that all of us, everyone in this room, all of us have reservoirs of full potential that lead to areas of great satisfaction but the roads that lead to those reservoirs are guarded by the dragon of fear. I know in my life that fear has held me back and I don't claim to have found a switch that I can switch and all my fears are gone but I know that I'm becoming a more fearless person. And part of it is just realizing that part of our journey of the heart is experiencing a fearless heart and that's something that God is calling us into. You see, fear is a matter of the heart. It's an issue of our heart. It's about the condition of our heart And all through scripture, we see it linked. Fear and our heart, and there's something linked there. Psalm 27, though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear. Psalm 112, they will have no fear of bad news. Their heart is satisfied. Proverbs 12, an anxious heart weighs a person down. Isaiah 35, to those with fearful hearts, be strong. Do not fear. Jesus himself says my peace I give to you my peace I leave with you not as this world gives do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid fear is a matter of the heart fear is an indicator of something going on in our heart it gets its start in our heart so to break free from fear we're going to have to get in touch with what's going on in our heart that's part of the journey of the heart there's a reason for this I love I love how Dallas Willard says it in his book renovation of the heart I think he makes it real clear why the heart is so important he said our life and how we find the world and now now and in the future almost totally is a simple result of what we have become in the depths of our being in our heart from there we see the world and interpret reality from there we make our choices break forth into action and try to change the world we live from our depths, from our heart. And that's exactly why you and I are going to have to get in touch with our heart if we're to experience freedom from fear. Your heart is the center. Your heart is the truest you. It's the deepest part of you. Your heart is of supreme importance. And it's in your heart that you find love and joy and passion and beauty. but it's also in your heart that you find pain. And it's that pain that drives us to fear because we don't want to ever feel that pain again. So today I want to do something a little different with you. I want to take you on a journey. What I did was, this is a few years back, I looked at my life and my journey and God met me at a place in scripture and I was profoundly impacted by a book called The Sacred Romance by John Eldridge and I actually set up and did a retreat with our senior hires. And on this retreat, we did an exercise and I'm gonna invite you into that exercise this morning. This is not the answer to breaking free from fear, but it is a step, a significant step. You see, it is the truth that will set us free. and part of our freedom from fear will be when we see the truth about what is going on in our heart and we receive the truth of what God says. If you've been around Open Door for a while, you may have done something like this before but I'd really encourage you to open yourself up to what God might do through it. If you look in your bulletin, you will find a sheet of paper like this. Looks like this. It has a heart and then there are four arrows entering it. There are four boxes around it. Your heart and my heart have been struck by arrows. The arrows are the things in our life, in your life and my life, that have wounded us deeply. Typically, they're out of our control. A lot of times, we had no say about it. We couldn't prevent it. We didn't choose it. But it happens. It's not our fault, but it happens. Some arrows will be because of choices we made. The arrows bring a great deal of pain. But in reality, the arrows aren't the worst part of the deal. The worst part of the deal are the messages that come attached to the arrows. The messages that come attached to those arrows are the things that we come to believe because of the painful arrows. I'm going to help you out, and I'm going to do this because if I'm asking you to do this, and I am asking you to do it. If you can, I would encourage you, I'd challenge you to take some time to get away to process this and then share this with the people close to you, but I'll talk more about that in a little bit. But since I'm asking you to do it, I feel like it's only fair that I kind of show you what I'm talking about. And to do that, I'm going to tell you three stories. Three stories that involve three arrows and the messages that came with them. The first one is my own story, one of my arrows. And you may know this if you were here when I spoke about this. When I was two years old, my mom and I were in a car accident, and my mom was killed. That's an arrow. I wrote it down. I wrote right on the arrow. I wrote my mom's death. That's an arrow. That is a painful thing. It was my fault. I didn't plan it. I couldn't prevent it, but it happened. Car accidents happen. I can't explain it. I don't know why. It's a mystery. But you know what? That arrow pierced my heart deeply. And along with that arrow came some messages. Messages like this. Al, you can't really trust God. I mean, how did he let that happen? You know what, Al? Important people, they're always going to leave you. They're going to be gone like that. you're all alone in this world don't get excited about life because in the end you're going to be really disappointed and while at two years of age I did not choose to make a conscious choice to believe those things the arrow went deep and I did believe those things as I grew up and it has been a battle for me to believe the truth it's affected me my wife is probably the most loyal committed, full of integrity person I know but early on as we were dating and early on into our marriage I was afraid she was going to leave me I was afraid if she really knew me if I didn't do it just right and so I put all kinds of pressure in weird situations why would I do that I was so insecure trying to hold on well where'd that come from where'd that important people always leave you they're gone like that and so it affected how I treated my wife the relationship that we had it caused barriers the messages that we believe from those arrows impact us and if we're going to be have a fearless heart part of our journey of this heart is going to be to break free. I'll tell you another arrow. This one isn't one of my arrows. I actually got permission from my wife to share one of her arrows. One of the things that drew me to my wife back in college was that she had academic and career goals. Those are things I had never thought of before. I couldn't believe she was there to study. I was there to play ping pong. she had some real goals some real things that she specifically was shooting for there was a specific school with a specific field of study and she did what it took she had established a tremendous gpa she had done all the extra stuff above and beyond she had put in the time and research and in study and gone to extra training sessions and in all kinds of stuff like that she She had done tons of volunteer hours. She had got tremendous references. It didn't surprise me when she was offered the chance to be interviewed out of a huge number of people. A small group got an interview, and then just a couple would be chosen. It didn't surprise me. She had done what it took. I remember sitting there as she was in the interview. And as she went in, just sitting there waiting, and I remember when she came out. And as she got in the car, and the tears were streaming down her face. You see, in that interview, there's four or five PhD types that interview. One of them had seen some minor, minute, insignificant thing on something she had written that they didn't agree with. And he decided that she should have never been invited for an interview to begin with. And he was going to make a point to humiliate, to question her integrity, to shame, to put her down. For 20 minutes, this person attacked and criticized her before telling her to get out. Her arrow was a person in power, using that power to insult and humiliate. It wasn't her fault. It was out of her control, but it happened. That arrow came with messages. Some of the messages she got were, why even try? You don't cut it. It doesn't pay to put your whole heart into something. It's just going to get stepped on anyway. There are people who use power to control, manipulate, abuse, crush, hurt, and exploit. And some of you know exactly what I'm talking about. And you've just identified an arrow. Finally, I want to share with you one more arrow. This arrow is an arrow of one of our students here at Open Door, who was on that retreat that we did. And I'm actually going to let her tell her story by video. But I want you to listen close to her story. She takes it a step farther than I've done with the first two, where she tells a little bit about her journey to freedom. I'm Jessica Mandeli. I'm a senior at Wayzata High School. About two years ago, when I went on a senior high retreat, me and Al got to talking about some of the arrows in my life. and one of them was way back when I was four. I had cancer. People were afraid of me. On my school bus, a girl would always run home after school because she thought I was scary because I changed into a bandana from my wig one day at school. And I guess that just freaked her out. People would lift up my hair. They'd be like, you're bald. And they'd be like, ew, let's stay away from her. I used to wear a baseball cap, and it was because I didn't want my hair to fly up because people always used to laugh and point. So I figured, okay, I'll just hide all my scars, keep everything in, don't let anybody get to know me. And so I just thought, okay, people don't like me, So I probably am not supposed to have friends. Later on, I got to know the truth that I was a cool person, that I deserved to have friends. And at church, I found a lot of friends. And they didn't care that I was bald, that I had cancer. They, like, just treat me like a normal person. Now, I don't wear a baseball cap. I let people get to know me. I tell people my story. Probably two years ago, I would not be sitting up here at all. applause applause applause applause applause applause applause applause applause applause applause and you don't have the courage to do something like that if you haven't faced your arrows. that's a fearless heart that's being developed that's a heart that's saying I will not let the messages of these arrows have the final say in my life because there is a God and he says what is true she's on a journey I remember that retreat so well I remember as she shared I remember putting my arm around her and she just sobbed as finally the messages were brought into the light and she saw that they were lies. And it's a journey. Is she doing it perfectly? No. But you know what? That guy I told you about who lost his mom in a car accident, he's not doing it perfect either. But we're on the same journey. And it's a journey of the heart and it's a journey of freedom. Freedom from fear. It's a beautiful thing to watch. Three people. three arrows and now it's your turn. What are your arrows? What are the messages of those arrows? How have they affected you? My prayer for this whole thing from start to finish has been that you would open up and share with those who are close to you in your life. I specifically had the idea of families coming together and sharing this. For some reason, God kept pushing it in my heart that parents to share with your kids. Because you know what? For some of you, this affects how you parent. And your kids, you've never told them about what's gone on in your heart. Young people, it would take a tremendous amount of courage to share with your folks. Maybe you can share it with your spouse, your best friend, your roommate, someone you came with this morning, a co-worker. It's not hard to do. My guess is that most of you already, you've identified some things. Maybe it's someone you do ministry with here, someone in a small group. But you can't do this alone. The journey of the heart, it's a group thing. It's something you do with other people. and it's not something you just share with everybody but you find those one or two, two or three close people and you share with them and what you're doing is you're bringing the truth out into the light and getting that out is critical to your journey of freedom another piece that is critical to your journey of freedom is letting the truth of God into your heart on the back of the sheet you'll see several passages of scripture these passages are gonna smash, collide head on with the messages of the arrows and you will be left with no choice but to know you know what somebody's lying somebody's lying and you know what you've got enough verses here to take you a while to work through and do it together the truth of God's word must be held up against the message of the arrows this is a starting place folks this is a journey but it's a starting place so I'd ask you to decide now that you're going to ask some other people you're going to do this and get it out into the open before I close I want to tell you one more story and this is a story about my friend Dan Dan and I met back in college and we became friends there, but we got better friends as he was a youth pastor here in Maple Grove and then started a church in Elk River. Dan was married to a wonderful wife, Tammy, and together with Tammy had two incredible boys, Taylor and Reed. Everything was going along wonderful. They had just started a new church and then the arrow hit. a year ago Dan a year ago this last week Dan died of cancer his funeral was actually right here in this room Dan's thoughts and journal entries were compiled into a book I've read the book a few times and what I've come to realize is this Dan's battle was not with cancer his battle was with the messages of the arrows the messages that said to him you can't trust God he's betrayed you obviously God isn't going to save your life it's up to you you better be afraid God is not enough for you or your family you don't really know what's going to happen to you when you die who's going to watch over your family? You see, Satan is behind these arrows and he wants them to go deep so they press on hard questions. If these messages would have been believed, there's no other choice. Those messages, if believed, take you smack dab right at to the heart of fear. There's nowhere else to go but to fear. instead of accepting those messages and giving them the final say I am glad to say that Dan instead chose to live in the truth as an example to me and maybe to you this morning he chose to live in the truth he immersed himself in the scriptures God's word one of the passages that all through his journals you saw time and time again was Psalm 91. He spoke of it often. It says this, He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say to the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust. Surely He will save you from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence. You will not fear the terror of night. nor the arrow that flies by day. While there were times when Dan was afraid, ultimately Dan knew the truth. And he found that truth in what he identified and called a place called surrender. This is also the title of his book. At the end of his life, Dan was in such a great deal of pain that it would have been easy to listen to the messages of the arrow. It would have been the easy thing to do. But he had come to a place called surrender. And he was living in that place. And from that place, he was able to write these words shortly before he died. the truth the truth about me and the truth about God is that my hope is not in my ability to follow God or love him or worship him my hope is in God's ability to love me and draw me to himself it's not my faithfulness to him it's his faithfulness to me this is our hope in Christ the pressure is no longer on us it is not up to us because we have put our hope in one far greater than ourselves I cannot save my life by eating the right foods or taking the right supplements for Pete's sakes I can't even eat right now the pressure is not on me to find the right doctor I don't have to follow a formula that will assure me of God's healing blessing to be released my hope is in his faithfulness he totally delights in me he and his will he is and will be faithful to me I am still the object of his affection I am still the apple of his eye I am still his I have very few assurances about tomorrow but I know that I will still belong to Jesus he will still be passionately pursuing me he will still be in love with me in the midst of whatever my body is going through this assurance will be enough he had come to a place called surrender a place where he knew the truth that it wasn't up to him that he couldn't do it, that it was far too painful. But in that same place of vulnerability and laying it down, he found that there is a God who is big enough and who is enough for his boys and who is enough for his wife and who will take care of him. He met a God and encountered a God who says, my grace is sufficient. let it go my I don't know where you're at in your journey with this, what I know is this you and I, to be free from fear will need to come to the place called surrender that's the place we're invited to every day to lay it down to say I can't do this to say it's too painful to say my only hope is you. And we want to give you a chance to do that today. As you leave, you're going to be inviting other people into your journey. But, you know, before you invite other people into your journey, we want to invite you to invite God into those deep places of your life, into the deep places of your heart where those arrows are sitting, where you're listening to the messages, and say, God, I say yes to you, and I want you to come. And we're going to give you a chance to do that this morning before we leave. Thanks.
