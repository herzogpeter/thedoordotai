pray together. Spirit of God, we ask you to bring life, not only in the words that I say, but in my spirit, that my spirit would be reflective of the love that you have between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and that that would flow out into my words, which would flow out into a community of people, which would become more like you and more like how you love each other in your family. Amen. Amen? Turn your Bibles to Luke 19. If you don't have a Bible, you can read it up on the screens. But I'm going to read a few, actually, a lengthy passage to you. It's a parable that you've probably heard before, but I want to read it to you. And as I read it to you, I want you to try to answer three questions. Number one, what's the point of this parable? Number two, who's the good guy? And number three, who's the bad guy? All right? number one what's the point number two who's the good guy number three who's the bad guy here we go Luke 19 starting in verse 11 and I'm reading out of today's new international version while they were listening to this they that is the people that were around Jesus he went on to tell them a parable because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once and he said a man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return. So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. Put this money to work, he said, until I come back. But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, we don't want this man to be our king. But he was made king and he returned home. Then he sent from the servants to whom he had given the money in order to find out what they had gained with it. And the first one came and said, Sir, your mina has earned ten more. Well done, my good servant, his master replied, because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, takes charge of ten cities. The second came and said, Sir, your mina has earned five more. His manser answered, You take charge of five cities. Well, then another servant came and said, Sir, here is your mina. I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth. I was afraid of you because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in, and you reap what you did not sow. And his master replied, I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant. You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in and reaping what I did not sow? Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest? And he said to those standing by, take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas. Sir, they said, he already has ten. He replied, I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given. But as for those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them, bring them here and kill them in front of me. Interesting parable. What's the point? Who's the good guy and who's the bad guy? well the point that I've always been taught is that the king is God and he gives us gifts to use and it's really important that we use those gifts and if we do we'll get put in charge of important things but if we don't God will stop giving us gifts and reject us that's the point of the parable that I've always been taught. And the good guy, obviously, is the king. And the bad guy, obviously, is the one servant who hid the talent away in a piece of cloth and buried it in the ground. That's what I've always been taught. Perhaps that's what you wrote down or thought about as the point and as the good guy and as the bad guy. But I want you to wonder with me if we're missing the point. I want you to wonder with me if we're hearing that parable and interpreting that parable that way more because of where we live and how we live than what Jesus actually meant when he taught it. I want you to just take a step outside of the normal context and just wonder with me if there might be a different interpretation. And this might feel tension to you. You might feel the tension of it, of stepping outside of the paradigm and looking at a different way of looking at it, but I want to invite you into that, into the tension and into the wondering. Are you with me? Yo, I got a yo. It's great. Well, I reject that interpretation for at least three reasons. The common interpretation that the point is that we are to use our gifts for God, though that is a good point. That is a kingdom principle. I think we are to use our gifts for God and to lean into them. Not refuting that. I just don't think that was the main point of the parable. So reason number one was that we interpret that parable because we live in a society where resources are unlimited. It's almost as if we see resources as a water faucet that we would just turn on, and they flow and flow and flow and flow. We feel like anyone can come into this society as poor as they want to be, and with enough ambitious hard work and with a little luck, they can make enormous amounts of wealth. And the only cost is the work that they put in. And we've seen this happen many, many times. And we tend to interpret this parable because I think that's our context. Because if we interpret the parable that way, then who in the end gets the major benefit? Us. The point that we get out of that interpretation is that if we use our gifts for God, we'll get more responsibility. And that's a good thing. We'll get more. It's very individualistic. And if you think about our society and the messages that we get all the time, it's the same thing. The point of life is to work hard so that you get more and amass more. And the only cost is the hard work that you do. Well, the society in which Jesus lived had a totally different context. They lived in what we would call a limited resource society. If our society kind of feels like a water faucet that you would just turn on and the resources just keep coming, they lived in a society that you could look at as a bucket of water. All the resources fit into this bucket. So if someone else were to get more in their individual cup, it came at the expense of someone else. If someone got richer, it's because someone else got poorer. Does that make sense? And so the people in their time, in Jesus' time, when they were hearing this, peasants who were listening to the teaching, and they were hearing that a servant of the king got given a wage or a lump of money to make more, what do you think was in their mind? this question where are they getting that money they're getting it either from me or my neighbor and my rent's going to go up and my costs are going to go up and my resources are going to go down they lived in a limited resource society so i really think that they would have heard this story very differently than we hear it. And this is just a principle that I think is really important as you read the scriptures, that were written in a time so much different than ours. My little niece, Olivia, is almost two years old. And every time I go to her house, she calls me TiVo, which is amazing. But she says, TiVo, TiVo, TiVo, and she takes me over to her little toy chest. And she opens it up, and guess what happens to all the toys that are in the chest? They all come out. You have, or are around, a two-year-old. She has this little bucket of little rubber duckies. There's like 30 or 40 little rubber duckies. And almost every time, she'll take that little bucket and go, and just shake it out all over her head and all over the floor. It's like she has to see every single one of her toys laid out in front of her. I think we need to take the scriptures the same way. And we need to dump them out and lay them out so that we can see the point that Jesus was trying to make in his context first so that we can apply it to our context. So the first reason why I reject the common interpretation is because the society in which Jesus lived was so different. And they wouldn't have heard it as a way to get more. The second reason is that it really doesn't follow from the story that was right in front of it. If you read back in verse 11, it said, while they were listening to this, meaning the story that had just been told, the story that had just been told was Zacchaeus. Remember the story of Zacchaeus, the wee little man? Wee little man was he. He climbed up into a... You guys, man, you went to Sunday school growing up. You're so great. Climbed Sycamore Tree because he was short. And, you know, I've always been a little offended by the... Anyway, so Jesus hangs out with him, and we don't know the conversation that happened except for he went to his house. Zacchaeus was a very wealthy man. He was a tax collector, which means that as a Jew, he stole money and he cheated fellow Jews out of money by taking the taxes and then skimming off the top and taking a little more for himself. Whatever conversation they had, the result was that Zacchaeus said, here and now, I give half of my possessions to the poor. And if I've cheated anyone out of anything, then I will pay them back how many times? Four times the amount. Now, I didn't do the math to figure out like, well, if Zacchaeus, if his net worth was like one million dollars, well, then half of that would be he just gives off the top $500,000. And then if he had gained, you know, through investments and stuff, if he had yielded like, I don't know, maybe let's say he got a 12% investment on his earnings. That still doesn't equal four times the amount that he had cheated the people. So basically Zacchaeus is saying, I am going penniless from now on. And to that Jesus says, salvation has come to your house. Now don't hear that like that's what you have to do. This is not a like direct, do, do this. But Jesus said, ah, you get it. He said, salvation has come to your house today. And that's kind of a play on words because what does the name of Jesus mean? He saves. Salvation has come to your house today. Jesus has come to your house today. It's another way of saying, you get it. Jesus, myself, I have entered into your spirit and you get it. and he doesn't amass more, he gave away more. That's the context when salvation comes to your house from which these people would have heard this story. So the people listening to this story lived in a different society. It doesn't follow the Zacchaeus story. And third, and this is where some of you probably keyed into it. But as you read about the king in this story, What kind of king does that king, does he sound like? Does he sound like Jesus or does he sound more like Herod? Yes. Yet, as you read this the first time, you probably interpreted the king has to be God. I mean, he has to be. I mean, anytime you talk about the king, in the scriptures talk about God because God is the king, so it has to be God. Well, my third reason why I reject this interpretation is because I really believe that this king sounded a lot more like Herod. When Jesus said, a man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return, that is not some random story. Suppose a man walked down Weaver Lake Road and turned right on Main Street and entered into Lifetime Fitness. no this would be like saying suppose a woman from new york decided to run for president you'd immediately think of someone right now i'm not making any that was like i'm not making a thing and there she's okay i'm not i'm really not i'm just saying the point is you would know who i'm talking about, right? Right? They would know who Jesus was talking about because King Herod actually did this. He went to Rome to have himself appointed as king. That's what he did. That's what you had to do to be appointed king of the Jews if you were living under Roman rule. Okay? And there was a Jewish delegation of people that went to Rome to oppose it. Herod's son, Antipas, same thing. And so when Jesus is saying this, what are they thinking? Peasant Jews in their mind. A certain man of noble birth went to a distant country. They would be automatically thinking, this is a story about these kings who oppress us. I really think that it would be like saying to citizens of Uganda, currently a story like this. A certain military commander became president and then he became dictator and then he slaughtered 500,000 people. But follow him and be like him because Idi Amin was a hero. That's how these peasant Jews would have heard the beginning of this story. So it does not follow that Jesus was trying to set it up to be a story about following this king. Are you tracking? Brilliant rabbis would tell stories like this and they would weave them together and they would try to set it up to where people would anticipate an ending. And then they would twist it. And Jesus was the most brilliant rabbi that ever lived. I think, I mean, that's what I think, and history shows himself to be true. So as they were hearing this story, this king that's giving these servants minas, and these servants are, you know, earning more minas at the expense of others. How do you think these peasant Jews would have hoped this story would end? Remember, back in verse 10, or back in verse 11, it says, while they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable. Because he was near Jerusalem, Jesus was, and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once. Their context was they were believing he was the Messiah, and he was going to Jerusalem to crown himself king. So as he was telling a story of this other king, how do you think they thought he was going to end it? remember he's walking into Jerusalem to crown himself king this oppressive king has been ruling over the Jews in a very unfair way how do you think they thought the story was going to end with the toppling of the king right that's what I think now that's just an opinion but that's what I think based on the evidence I think that's how they thought the story was going to end so how do you think they reacted when the villain of the story, which I think is the king, wins. And when the hero of the story, which I think is the servant who laid down his life because he didn't want anything to do with oppression, loses. What do you think was going through their minds about this king? About this Messiah? they might have been thinking next no you had a good run but next Jesus was declaring himself the anti-type to every king that had ruled under the oppression of Rome he was saying a kingdom is coming and I am its king but it's very different. In order to understand the kind of kingdom that Jesus was bringing, I think we have to look to Matthew 25. And perhaps some of you were thinking about this because some of you knew that, wow, there's another parable that's a lot like this. It's somewhere in the New Testament. I'm not sure where it is. Somewhere in the Gospels. I don't know. It sounded a lot like the king but it's a little different. It's in Matthew 25 starting in verse 14. and we're going to compare and contrast these two similar parables but we're going to see the key differences and in these differences we're going to see the kind of kingdom that Jesus is bringing in the kind of king that he is so Matthew 25 verse 14 bear with me as I read through it see if you can point out some of the differences again verse 14 of Matthew 25 it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. So also the one with two bags of gold gained two more. But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money. After a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. Master, he said, you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more. His master replied, well done, good and faithful servant. You've been faithful with a few things. I'll put you in charge of many things. Come and share in your master's happiness. Then the man with two bags of gold also came. Master, he said, you entrusted me with two bags of gold. See, I have gained two more. His master replied, well done, good and faithful servant. You've been faithful to a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness. Then the man who received one bag of gold came. Master, he said, I know that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seeds. So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here's what belongs to you. His master replied, you wicked, lazy servant. So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed. Well, then you should have put my money on deposit with the banker so that when I returned, I would have received it back with interest. Take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has 10 bags. For those who have will be given more and they will have an abundance. As for those who do not have, even what they have will be taken from them. And throw that worthless servant out into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. What are the differences? Well, at first glance, you think, not many. I mean, this is still a tough parable. Let's look at the differences. In Luke 19, 13, back on the evil king said this. He said, so he called 10 of his servants and gave them 10 minas. Put this money to work, one each, he said, until I come back. Now he gave them one mina each, and that was worth about two and a half years worth of wages, a really good chunk of money for a common laborer. He said, put this money to work until I came back, until I come back. Now, it's his money, but the point is he wants to gain more money, right? I mean, it's a selfish deal. He says, listen, I'm going away. I'm not going to be able to be in charge of my resources, so I want you to be, and I want to find out when I come back what you've made. If you turn back to Matthew 25, you see a different story. Jesus, or the king, in Matthew 25, 14 says, again, it will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. He entrusts his entire wealth to them, to the one he gives five bags of gold or five talents, which is the equivalent of 100 years worth of wages. A significantly different amount. I think in this parable, which I think reflects the true king, Jesus is making a statement about his kingdom and the statement is this. I am building a kingdom of a people to whom I am entrusting my entire kingdom. I'm giving it all to them. I'm giving it all away. I'm investing everything in them. Every last dime, every last penny. If they blow it, I blow it. I'm entrusting my entire kingdom to them. now surely all of us or most of us have asked and tried to answer this question like when was the time that you trusted your life to Jesus right I mean that's a question that I think is a really important one to ask but have you turned that on its head and ever asked yourself the question this When was the first time I realized that Jesus entrusted his entire life to me? Jesus, the King of Kings, Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, the one who will reign forever, has entrusted his entire kingdom to me and the people around me that are called the church. I mean, that is crazy. That is ludicrous. It's almost scandalous. It's such, it's almost foolish investment. That's the kind of king we have. My kingdom. The investment is people. I'm giving it all to people. I think it's what Jesus means in Matthew 13 when he tells this little story. He says the kingdom of heaven, Matthew 13 starting in verse 44, is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. And then in his joy, he went out and sold all he had and bought that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he finds one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. Can you imagine if that was a friend of yours that found a piece of land, a little north and a little west? And he said, oh my, listen, this land is worth everything. I'm selling everything. I'm selling my house, my cars, my kids, the whole deal. I gotta buy this piece of property because it is everything we would say foolish not a wise investment Jesus is saying when we understand the investment that the king is making it is worth everything now if that's true as a follower of this king and as a member of this kingdom this is gonna require something of you I mean the two and a half years of wages that the evil king gave is kind of like your neighbor saying hey I'm going on a paper route and I want you to take over the paper route can you do that I know it means getting up at 5 30 in the morning throwing the you know paper but there's this one house that has this one dog that pees on my lawn every day and if you just hit that dog you're going to get gratification it's really fun it's great if you if you take over my paper route it'll be awesome. You'd have to arrange your life a little bit to do that, but you could probably do that for a couple weeks, right? I mean, you'd hate it, but you could probably do it. When Jesus says, I'm entrusting my kingdom to you, because that's the kind of kingdom I am bringing, Jesus is saying this. It's like if Steve Jobs, the head of Apple, right? You've maybe heard of him. He said, man, I got to take a break. I'm going to go to India for five or six years. I'm going to find myself. I'm going to hang out with Sherpas. It's going to be great. I want you to take over Apple. I want you to come up with the next iPhone. It's not, you know, it shouldn't be tough. If you were to say yes to that assignment, you would have to rearrange your entire life, right? Your entire life, because it would be a great investment. Jesus is building a kingdom of people to whom he is investing everything. Second major difference. Let's go back to Luke 19 and see what the evil king says. Luke 19, 17, he says this. When the servant comes back after making the investment, making good on the investment, well done, my good servant, his master replied, because you've been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of 10 cities. In essence, he is saying, because you've been really good at making me more money and oppressing people, I want you to keep doing it. I want you to keep being in charge of those ten cities and keep oppressing those people so that you can make me more money. It really works well for the king. Back in Matthew 25, here's how Jesus rewards his people. Verse 21, his master replied, well done, good and faithful servant. You've been faithful with a few things. I'll put you in charge of many things. And here it comes. come and share in your master's happiness. Come and share in your master's happiness. That's the greater gift that the king is saying is really worth it. And I think in this parable, Jesus is saying, I'm building a kingdom of people who refuse to oppress others for their own gain, but instead invite people into their happiness. I'm building a kingdom of people who refuse to oppress people for their own gain, but instead invite them into their happiness. Now you may think of that and you may say, oppress, I mean, that's a big word. And I don't know that I dial into that. Let me tell you how I can unintentionally buy into a system of oppression. About a year and a half ago, I sold my 1998 Nissan Maxima. And I put it on car soup and I got a couple calls. The first one was from this 19-year-old Russian guy. His name was Milos or something like that. I can't remember his name. But he came over, he test drove it. He went in and got it checked out. He said, I really like the car. I want to make you an offer. Here's the offer. It's contingent on me having my dad check out the car. But I really, you know, I kind of want to, I mean, I'm pretty sure I want to buy this car. Well, then I got a call from this Somali dude. I said, hey, I'd love to check out the car. Can we set up a time to do it? So this guy came over. His friend and his friend who's a taxi cab driver dropped him off because this guy didn't have a car. He was obviously looking to buy one. And he drove the car, and he was very, oh, man, this is such a nice car. It's a great car. He said, I really like the car. I'd really like to buy it. And so I said, awesome. Because now I have two buyers, two bidders. So I said, well, that's great. I'm glad you like the car. There is another guy who kind of, you know, made an offer. so if you want to make me an offer that maybe is a little better than his, that'd be great. And he said, oh no, I could never do that to that man. If he really wants that car, he should have this car. And you know that moment when it's like ashes in your mouth? And you kind of say, yeah, I got to go prepare a sermon. so thanks for being together he got this in a way that I didn't you know what he did? he invited me into his happiness he invited me into his happiness I want to invite you to ask the spirit what little ways am I buying into a system of oppression where I try to get a little more at the expense of someone else? I'm trying to do that and fumbling my way through it, but I think if you ask yourself questions like that, that's the kind of question the rabbi would ask of you. That's the kind of question the rabbi would ask of you. He's building a kingdom where people refuse to oppress others for their own gain, but instead invite them into their happiness. The third difference. Again, let's look back at what I'm calling the evil king. Cue the Darth Vader music. Is that the Darth Vader? Anyway, verse 27 of Luke 19. But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them, bring them here and kill them in front of me. Now, it's gruesome enough that he has these people that just didn't want her to be king killed. I mean, that's gruesome enough. But the fact that he wants them killed in front of him gives us a little window into the character of this king. Back in Matthew 25, here's what this different king says. Verse 30, throw that worthless servant outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Well, the word worthless there literally means useless. It means no longer useful for anything. It means so useless that this person is no longer useful for anything. And the word darkness is really an interesting word. It comes from the root word to stop, and it carries with it the connotation as if you are going around in the darkness and it's so pitch black outside that you literally do not know where you're going anymore and someone stops you and says, stop fumbling. You're not getting anywhere. So there's even in this, and wonder with me here on this, but there's even in this, in verse 30, the sense that the good, kind, benevolent king is saying to us who have become so calcified in our selfishness. It's as if the king is saying, stop and change while there is still time. Stop. I believe there is a sense in which the person that we are becoming now through the power of the Spirit and through God's redemption is the kind of person we will end up being for all eternity. And conversely, the kind of person we are becoming if we are consistently refusing and rejecting the redemptive, merciful work of God, and as we become more and more like the king in the first story, calcified into our selfishness, we become more and more like that person that we will always be for eternity. And I think this is a warning to us. And the king is saying, stop before it's too late. Stop fumbling in the darkness because you are nearing the point of uselessness. And that is a hard word. But I want to invite myself and you into wondering about, God, where am I becoming calcified? Where am I resisting the redemptive work of your spirit in my life that is inviting me to become more and more like the rabbi? I believe Jesus is saying in this parable that I am building a kingdom of people who believe that the kingdom of God starts right now. And I am building a kingdom of people who need to lead the way in being selfless so that others might live. And that is starting now. I'm building a kingdom of people who do not look for their own gain first, who refuse to oppress others. I'm building a kingdom of people who I'm entrusting everything to. That's the kind of kingdom I am building because that's the kind of king I am. Look back in Luke 19. This is insane. Right after this story that Jesus tells. Verses 28 through 29. After Jesus has said this, the parable that we just read in Luke 19, the parable about the evil king, Jesus went on up ahead going up to Jerusalem to crown himself king. And as he approached Bethpage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, and I'll just say dot, dot, dot, Jesus goes on ahead on this journey of being this kind of king in this kind of kingdom. And he marches right into the Mount of Olives. and what else happens at the Mount of Olives? He's betrayed. And his way of doing things seems to end in nothing but betrayal and death. But you know what? In the upside down kingdom of God, guess what death turns into? Life. It's the only kingdom where that's true. Death turns into life so that others may live. And Jesus is saying, I'm leading you, a community of people, into dying so that others may live. Into putting down your own gain so that others might gain. And I am leading you into becoming like me in that. And that's the kind of kingdom I'm bringing and that's the kind of kingdom I'm inviting you to. Are you on board? That's what Jesus is saying. you know my wife and I live near this lake near Minneapolis and there's this marsh right by the lake and a couple years ago they burned down all the living things right around the marsh and we were like what is that you know the outrage why they burn it down was it vandals you know and and then we ran into this person said no no they they burned it down because some unhealthy things was was growing in it and it needed to be burned down but you just wait you wait a couple of years and you're going to see some amazing life gathered around this place. And just yesterday morning, my wife and I were walking with our little eight-week-old son. It's a whole different story. And you know what was all around that marsh, man? Life. Flowers and birds and animals and life. Life coming from death. That's the kind of kingdom that our rabbi leads us into. Are you with him? That's what he's asking. Wonder with me about how we can read the scriptures, taking off our own lenses of how we see them, to see what the rabbi really meant, and wonder with me about the kind of life that might grow in us if we do that. Next week, I want to invite you back. we're going to take a look at a passage in John chapter 3 where the phrase born again is used. And we're going to take a look at what that means and how Nicodemus would have heard that and what that would have meant to that society and what that means to our society. So I want to invite you back to that. And before you leave, I would like to invite you to stand for a benediction. so again what a benediction is is a charge and you can accept the charge you can refuse the charge but I think this community is heading in this direction and so if there's any piece of your spirit that is with it just in your spirit like be open open up may you be a kingdom of people who receive the responsibility that Jesus entrusts to you he's giving you everything and may you be a kingdom of people who refuse to oppress others for your own gain but instead invite people into your happiness and may you be a kingdom of people that believe that the kingdom of God starts right here and right now, and Jesus is inviting you into it, and he's asking you, are you in? Are you with me? May you say yes. May you say yes. May you say yes. Amen. We'll see you next week.
