Open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, chapter 5. Surprise, surprise, surprise. Verse 1. We're going to be covering a little bit more ground today, so we've got some reading to do. Therefore, be imitators of God as beloved children and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma. But do not let immorality or any impurity or greed even be named among you as is proper among saints. And there must be no filthiness or silly talk or coarse jesting which just doesn't fit, but rather be giving thanks. For this you know with certainty that no immoral person or impure person or covetous man who is an idolater has an inheritance in the kingdom of God, in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, For because of these things, the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore, do not be partakers with them. For you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light. For the fruit of the light consists of goodness and righteousness and truth, trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. And do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them. But instead, even expose them. Verse 13, but all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light. Let's pray. Father God, we thank you for your precious word. And I thank you for the power that is there when we take the time to first of all study it. But that is not enough, Lord. We need to open our hearts to it. But that is not enough, Lord. We need to let it change us. father do your work in our hearts this morning amen be ye therefore imitators of god i've been seized by this concept i have been captured by it i feel in some ways consumed by it in so many dimensions of my life over the last few weeks when i have discovered this and have let it begin to infiltrate me it has affected sometimes even negatively certain dimensions of my life because I'm beginning to see areas in my life where I'm not anywhere near what God would have me be. And I happen to know that many of you are being seized by this too. What it means to be an imitator of God. What it means to look like my father who bore me. What it means to love like he loved. And what it means to give like he gave and care like he cared and minister like he ministered to be broken. like he was broken. I trust that all of us have been affected by this deep teaching that is found through the Apostle Paul in the book of Ephesians that you are being changed by it. But I want to warn you about something and this is just a preface as we're in the middle of understanding what this living word really means. The warning is simply this that we have an adversary. New news, huh? Not really. The point is this though that our adversary is a liar he is the father of all lies he is the deceiver and he is the destroyer and when we begin to talk about things like imitating God when we begin to talk about things that would look at the church the body of Christ and say we need to really be the body because we haven't been the body when we talk about loving like he loved and walking like he walked what desire the deceiver would say to you and to me because he's been saying it to me for three weeks what desire in your heart Johnson could possibly be more futile more doomed to failure you're an idealist you're ridiculous why don't you just slide back into kind of a mediocre existence just kind of let it slide and just preach pious platitudes give information and keep the whole thing on an informational level so we all know what it means but not necessarily apply it and believe it and change be ye therefore imitators of God. We are discovering that being a believer involves an awful lot more than joining a church, that it involves an awful lot more than raising my hand or walking an aisle. It involves an awful lot more than coming once in a while and sitting in a pew or even serving on a board or working in a committee or working in a WANA or teaching a class or preaching a sermon. But the bottom line in Christianity is that lives are being changed. But the bottom line in Christianity is that what it means that I am spending the rest of my life stripping off the old and putting on the new, and stripping off the old and putting on the new, and becoming aware all the time of the old that needs to be put away, and the new that needs to be put on. And that isn't easy. Telling the truth about my sin. Telling the truth about my anger that I've called something else. Telling the truth about my attitudes that I've rationalized away. Stripping it off and putting it on. The bottom line is this. The ultimate goal for every one of us here, if we know Jesus Christ as our Savior, is that we would be conformed to the very image of his Son. But let us not be naive. Doesn't that sound wonderful? That's the kind of thing we say in church. I want to just warn you that if you begin to live your life in that lane, you are going to enter into a war. and I feel like I'm in the middle of it right now the changing of our lives by the spirit of God living in us taking this seriously we've got decisions to make are we gonna or are we not I want to get back to the text do some teaching that was for free we've been discovering we've been discovering that the pattern of Christ's love when we talk about loving like Christ loved in verse 2 when we look at the pattern of Christ's love and that pattern of his love that identifies us most as being his son as being his children and me being his father the verifier that I am in fact my father's son is that I would love but the love that he had we've been discovering is not some sort of warm and romantic emotion. God loved so much that he shed a tear. No, God loved so much that he gave the best he had. God loved so much that there was a behavior that resulted from it. The essence of God's love, if I was to open up a Webster's Dictionary or something, the essence of God's love is this, it is giving in nature. It is self-sacrificing, selfless in nature. By its very nature, by definition, it is forgiving. In essence, God's love is absolutely unconditional. Those are all definitions. They are cold. They are sterile. In many ways, to me, they are absolutely meaningless. What I relate to better in understanding is this. What does that love mean? The thing that I need to focus on is this. That his love, unconditional, selfless, giving, resulted in behavior. And the behavior is what I see. And then I identify the behavior as being selfless and forgiving and caring. And the behavior is what we looked at last week. You remember? You know what we looked at? We looked at his ministry. His ministry was simply a manifestation of who he was, the way he loved. The definition of his love resulted in him looking at ministry and doing whatever it took to minister. That's what he did. Wherever he had to go to meet a need is where he went. Whatever he had to say to tell the truth is what he said. Whatever the price he had to pay to care about people, to love, to give himself, he paid the price. Whatever it took is what he did. That's the manifestation of the sterile definition. Jesus was not a maintainer of the status quo. The very presence of his life in a room like this would demand change. We would begin to move into different kinds of avenues. He was not a respecter of persons. The very kind of love that he had demanded he couldn't be a respecter of persons. A respecter of persons is simply one who would come into a congregation like ours and look at the people that can help me. And the people who can help me in this congregation are the ones I'm going to be palsy-walsy with. And I'm going to say the nice things to you. And the ones who really can't help me and really can't, you know, build me up are the ones I'm going to reject. Jesus was not a respecter of persons. The definition of his love wouldn't allow that kind of behavior. he came into a culture and absolutely countered it the reason was because his love was totally opposite they were give me he was giving they were taking and he was giving he rejected the religion of his day and the reason he did wasn't because it was right or wrong it was because it didn't love it didn't give it was always taking be ye therefore imitators of God problem is this whatever it is that God establishes in this earth I'll guarantee you one thing that Satan is going to come along and counterfeit it whatever it was that God establishes in earth Satan is going to counterfeit it Satan is going to take the truth and he's going„Å® make it look like a lie and Satan is going to take the lies and he's going to make it look like the truth and Satan is going to take your anger and he's going to pervert it and he's going to take the communication from your mind and he is going to disease it. And he is going to take the attitude of your heart and he is going to destroy it with bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and evil speaking. And he is going to take love and he is going to pervert it. I guarantee it. And in ways that sometimes we don't ever recognize, where God has established a love that is born of him, I guarantee that Satan is going to come along with a love that is born of him. And we need to understand it. And this is one of the arenas where Satan really works well. The reason he works so well is simply this. Because there isn't a person here who doesn't need to be loved. It doesn't need to love. It's part of what makes us human. It's a basic human need. I need to love and I need to be loved. And if that is a basic human need, I guarantee Satan's going to be working in that arena. Every song we hear, all the TV programs we watch, all the movies we go to, all the magazines we read, all the books we read are telling us that same thing. Whether the songs be rock or Bach or country or classical, the message is still the same. It's all about love, how to get it, once I get it, how to keep it, if I lose it, what do I do then? Oh my goodness, and it's all this fantasy that there is this ultimate love somewhere that will ultimately fulfill me, and I go on this mad race trying to find it. And wherever I have to go is where I'm going to go. And it's all about satisfying me and filling me up. In essence, if I were to give you a definition of the love that is born of God and the love giving you the distinction between the love that is born of God and the love that is born of Satan, it would be very simple and clear. Love born of God says, I am here primarily to meet your need. That's what Jesus said when he came. I am here not to be served, but to serve. I am here primarily to meet your need. The love born of Satan says this, you are here primarily to meet my need. You think on that, you're going to hear it all morning. You are here primarily to meet my need. Love born of Satan is in its very essence and by definition conditional. You give me what I want, you say what I like, you treat me the way I want to be treated and I will be nice to you, maybe. It is by its definition unforgiving. You blow it too many times, you don't do it the way I want, you don't look the way I want, too many times and I guarantee you're out of my life. The love born of Satan is in, by very definition, totally selfish. It is about meeting my needs. It is wrapped up in meeting my desires, my whims, and my wants. It is selfish, it is conditional, it is unforgiving, and it is basically a fantasy. It does not bring the fulfillment that it promises. And maybe the biggest delusion of the love born of Satan is simply this, that it looks like it's normal. It looks okay. It looks like it really makes sense. That kind of love is the kind of love that I can get involved in. But it doesn't bring the kind of fulfillment that it advertises. So what we do, what the advertisers do, and what the love born of Satan does is it plasters a girl up on a billboard with hairy legs and an ugly face and big fat blimpo, right? No, not at all. It doesn't do that at all. It takes the most unbelievably attractive kind of thing that I can. And it says, come to Las Vegas. And what is being promised when I go there and follow that illusion? What's being promised is fulfillment. What is being promised is joy. What is being promised is love, right? That's where it is. It's there. And like a sucker, I go for it. And I chase it. And off I go, pursuing the ultimate love. And it's beautiful. And if that ultimate love leads me away from my commitments, and if it leads me away from my family, well, that's the brakes because I'm after this fantasy. And it's a furious attempt to do what? It's a furious attempt to satisfy me, my needs, my wants, my desires and whatever I have to do to do it is what I'm going to do. Totally opposite the things we've been describing concerning the love of God, love born of God. So I go from one person to another, and whether it be in a relationship between a man or a woman, or just a friend and a friend, this is not just sexual that I am talking about. I go from friend to friend, from person to person, from church to church, and basically what I do is I go to you and you are there primarily to meet my need, right? That's why you're here. And I come to you and I just suck you dry. And when you're dry and you don't meet my need anymore or I see a flaw, I just discard you and it's over. And I go on to find some other kind of toy and some other kind of object that can satisfy me, that can fulfill me. We're getting a divorce. Why? It's real simple. You don't meet my need. And buddy, that's why you're here. Here. At least once a week. It is. That's why you're here. Wife, the reason you're here in this relationship is to meet my need. You better know it. Husband, the reason you're here in this relationship is to meet my need. You better know it. As long as we know the rules, okay. Love born of Satan is based on my desire, my pleasure, my gratification. The bottom line is this. It doesn't give, it takes. It doesn't give, it takes. There are relationships here in this church that are based on these kinds of things. I want to tell you something like this. That if you have a relationship with two people who take, it's not going to last very long. Again, whether it's a man and a woman or two people of the same sex, just a friendship. If you have two people who are into taking and that's their obsession, the relationship won't last. A lot of relationships that are real sick do exist. And that's a relationship based like this. There's one giver and there's one taker. I don't even want to have a raise of hands how many relationships there are like that here one is a giver and one is a taker I wonder when we're going into Ephesians 5 that some of the perversion that has even come into the church that what it means for wives to be submissive is this you are the giver, he is the taker that is sick that is love, friend, born of Satan, not of God the bottom line is it doesn't give and however else love would manifest itself in terms of behavior the bottom line is that is that it doesn't give it takes I want you to think about a minute just very quickly of what I said about the manifestation of God's love the manifestation of Christ's love the fact that it was giving and forgiving and unconditional was ministry wasn't it it was giving it was meeting people's needs no matter what it took it was caring about people no matter what it cost the manifestation of Satan's love is simply other kinds of behavior, and that is this. Again, that you are there to satisfy me. The manifestation may be divorce. The manifestation may be some sort of sexual promiscuity. The manifestation may be that I am never able to maintain a relationship with anybody. On and on and on. Paul says this, don't let that shallow, empty, satanic kind of love even be named among you. And again, the bottom line, the real problem in all my relationships is that I'm a taker, I'm not a giver. And all the behavior I have in my life just verifies that fact. Pastors do it to churches. It works like this. You want to know something, folks? I've got some news for you. The only reason you're really here, as far as I'm concerned, is to meet my need. That's right. See, it's really a big stepping stone for me, and I'm just going to be here as long as I feel yummy in my tummy, as long as you tell me the things I want to hear, as long as you pat me on the back and make me feel warm and gooey, But if another brighter star shows up somewhere, I'm gone, buddy. Because you're here basically to meet my need. Pastors do it to churches. Churches do it to pastors. Churches, a lot of times, do it to pastors and elders and the leadership of the church because basically, why are they there? They are there to meet my need, right? That's why they're there. It couldn't possibly be the opposite. It couldn't possibly be reciprocal. And so what we do, we take those who are giving themselves in service and we suck them dry. And then when they're dry and there's no more left to give, we just discard them. Wonderful concept of the body. You want to know something else? We do it to each other. We do it to each other. And maybe the reason right now as you're sitting here you're mad at your wife is because fundamentally you're a taker and not a giver. And she didn't give you what you wanted her to give you. And the reason you're here this morning and you're mad at your husband is basically the problem with you is that you're a taker, not a giver. And they're not meeting my need. And the reason you're sitting here this morning, some of you are sitting here this morning and you're mad at the person who's over there in the back or up here in the front or something like that is because they said something to me and they didn't meet my need. They don't know. They don't care. The fundamental problem maybe is that you're a taker and not a giver. And the reason, see, you are here is to meet my need. Right? And the reason that person who's sitting next to me, the only reason they're here is to meet my need and if they don't, I'm ticked. We've got a bunch, and then with that kind of attitude, we end up with a church full of people wanting to have their needs met and nobody getting their needs met. A church full of takers and not givers. A church that doesn't look anything like the body and that's the perversion that Paul is talking about right here. Don't let that perverted kind of love even be named among you. Again, these behaviors are simply manifestations of a deeper condition, the fact that I'm not a giver. And Paul begins to talk about, in verse 3, some of the manifestations that were really plaguing that Ephesian church. Let's look at some of the behaviors in that church that were a result of a perverted love. The first one is immorality. The word there is pornea. I would add to that word another Greek word, graphe, which means to write, pornographie. That whole concept is in there. I don't know for sure, and I am not stating this dogmatically, but I have a feeling that in Paul's mind, the ultimate expression of God's love perverted in terms of behavior would be this right here, porneia. Sexual sin, illicit sexual activity outside of marriage. Perversion of what God intended to be a beautiful example of what it means for two people to be giving 100% to one another instead of two people taking 100% from one another. And when that gets perverted, that becomes a beautiful illustration. And maybe the reason he's so big on this is not so much that sexual sin, pornea, is so much more heinous than any other sin, but that it is so visible. And it is a beautiful illustration of God's love perverted, one that I can look at and understand. Because the bottom line in fornication, in terms of its sin, is simply this. That I see you as an object that is there primarily to fulfill me. That's it. And I call it love, but it's unbelievably conditional. As long as your hair is right, and as long as your body stays nice, and as long as you don't get fat, and as long as you don't get skinny, and as long as you don't get too many zits, and as long as everything is wonderful, that, oh, aren't we in love? Garbage. It's unbelievably conditional. It's totally unforgiving. And it's absolutely selfish, because it's based on the premise that you are an object that I will use to satisfy me. Listen, love born of God results in me being broken for your fulfillment. You know that? And love born of Satan results in you being broken for me because I use you and I just suck you dry. Don't let that kind of sickness even be named among you. Another problem that he mentioned in that church was the problem of impurity. immorality and impurity. The Greek word there is akatharsia. Eleven times it's mentioned in the New Testament. Now listen to this. The first time it was mentioned, it was used by Jesus to describe the rotten stench of decaying bodies full of maggots. I love to say that. Isn't that disgusting? It is disgusting. It should be disgusting. And the next ten times that that same word is being used, it's being used in terms of sexual sin, immoral acts, passions that are leading right up from little tiny kinds of things right up to sexual orgies that are absolutely out of control, totally based on taking from you to fulfill me. And my fulfillment is that by draining you. That's how it's done. Again, it is the frenzied mad desire to gratify me. And God says, friend, that is not love. In fact, in my mind, that is synonymous with a rotten stench of dying bodies full of maggots. It's sickening. and the bottom line I hate to be redundant but the bottom line the foundation from which this kind of behavior flows is simply this I am a taker not a giver and that I can get what I want by taking it from you I want to tell you something in these kinds of relationships there's always two victims the first victim is the taker the one who goes and looks at you and decides I'm going to pull it out of you. He's a victim. I have a little trouble feeling sorry for him or her because it seems that there is the aggression there, but the victim, my friend, has bought the lie that joy comes in taking. They've bought the lie that fulfillment comes because I take you and use you, and I can just go from one person or one thing to another and just suck it dry until I'm all filled up. They're a victim because they've been lied to, they bought the fantasy, and they spend their lives skipping around from one toy to another. And sometimes that toy is a person and sometimes those toys are things. And it's much more appropriate if I'm dealing with a sick person, I'd much rather they play with toys than people. The problem is they do both. The other victim in relationships like these is the take-ee. And maybe you've been in this boat yourself and you end up feeling used. And you end up feeling like somebody did suck you dry. And you end up feeling dirty. And you end up feeling real unlovable. And sometimes you end up feeling real angry. And what you thought was going to be fulfillment and what you thought was going to fill you up and what you thought was going to be love was a lie. It was love born of Satan. It's all about taking. It's all about using you to fill me. The third problem they had, there was greed. Immorality and impurity and greed. Don't let those even be named among you. Another word for greed is covetousness. I love this. I want to tell you something. This word right here is the culmination of everything I'm teaching you this morning because it's the illustration of it. You know, I've got a problem. When I first saw this, I thought, where in the world does greed come in with dealing with these relationships? Where does covetousness come in here? Until I began to study and realize what the bottom line in all of this is. I covet money. I covet things, right? I covet possessions. I covet position. I covet power. Things are things. I want, I see it, I want to possess it. The problem is that when my love has been perverted, the key word is possession, right? The key word is possessing it for myself. And relationships are no longer relationships. People are no longer people. People become things that I use to gratify me. And so I covet my neighbor's wife. And I covet my neighbor's husband. and I want to tell you something it has nothing to do with me loving her or him and wanting to give to them something from me that would fulfill them and build them and edify them I see them as a thing because I am a taker not a giver I don't understand anything about love and that person is a thing that I am going to use to fill me up pornea God's love perverted same word here for covetousness is found in another Greek form same kind of word and it also has the meaning this same word also has the meaning of one who is defrauded or used or involved in a hoax of some kind it would work something like this a husband stalks a woman that is not his own wife that word stalking her or a woman stalks a man that is not his own wife, just gets her eye on him and covets and desires to do what? To possess him, to possess her. The problem is it's a fraud. It's a lie. You grab for it and it's gone. You've been defrauded. You've been tricked. But the reason you're such an easy mark for that kind of relationship is basically you're a taker, not a giver. And when something comes in front of your eyes that looks like I can suck from that what I want, I go for it. You've been deceived. The Latins call it the love of possessing. The love of possessing. And it's a burning. And I'm going to tell you something. That when that burning begins to move within the human heart, you'll sacrifice anything to get what you think you need. You'll sacrifice your kids, and you'll sacrifice your family, and your home, and your spouse, and your friends, and your job, when you get that hunger to possess you'll destroy anything in your life to move after that thing that you need to have verse 4 goes on into all sorts of different kinds of talk there must be no filthiness gutter talk, silly talk moros is the Greek word there we get our word moron the idiot who can't think of anything to say but something that's just born out of the gutter born out of filth and a perversion of love the other jesting, coarse jesting that's kind of a high obscenity That is the obscenity of the talk show host who can't say one, you can't hardly say anything of purity or honesty with them because everything that they hear is twisted into another direction. And it's made to be perverted and you couldn't possibly go into a conversation with this kind of person and talk about sincere love, talk about sincere giving, have a real relationship because everything is being twisted and perverted in another direction. And then verse 5 and 6 comes and says this pretty heavy stuff. For this you know with certainty, that people whose love is born of Satan have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Verse 6, friends, don't let anybody deceive you. Don't let anybody tell you it's alright to have a love that's born of Satan. Don't let anybody tell you that. Because of those kinds of things, the wrath of God, Because of love perverted, the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. I'm afraid this passage here doesn't leave us a lot of room to wonder where God stands on love perverted. Not a lot of room to wonder where he stands on people who are obsessed with taking and not giving. where he stands on a love that's born of Satan. Let no one deceive you. Now what I want to do is I want you to back off the text a minute and look at me, and I want to ask you a question. How does all that hit you? You know, I'd like us to sit back and look at the love that I just described, sometimes in very graphic terms, and just look at it. Pretty ugly, huh? I'd like to get inside of some of your hearts and know how you're responding to that. I'm sure that there are some among us who are going, That's despicable. How could anybody be involved in that kind of thing? Vile, filthy. It is. It is. It's vile and it's filthy. But I want to make you aware of one more thing. That fornication and immorality and impurity and greed are simply manifestations of the love being perverted. And that so many of us, though we aren't involved in these particular behaviors, are involved in all sorts of other kinds of behaviors that indicate that our love has been perverted. that our love is born of Satan because I'm a taker and not a giver. And I know there are some people who are sitting and struggling with that right now, but you know what? Right now, I've got to be honest because I'm a little more concerned with those who are sitting here this morning and you're listening to this and you're saying simply this, you know, I'm the one you're describing here because I'm a giver and not a taker. I mean, I'm a taker. and not a giver. And I've been involved in that kind of thing. And I've been sucked into that kind of lie. And I've been defrauded. And this morning when you're talking about these things, I just feel so guilty and I feel so dirty. I want to tell you something right now. Real quick, there's two lies that Satan would tell you. The first lie is this. That falling for the fantasy, that living a lifestyle of self-love, of self-taking. The first lie is this, that there's nothing wrong with that, that it's okay, that it really won't hurt you, that it's really the way to go, and look, everybody's doing it, and it's okay, no problem. That's the first lie, and we fall for it. The second lie is far more damaging than the first, and that's this, that once you fell, that once you went for the fraud, that you can never be restored. And I want to tell you this, that's a lie from hell. And I know there are people, and I even hesitate when I preach sermons like this, to do it because I know there are people in our congregation that have struggled with this kind of thing in their past and they have come to the Lord and they have gone to the people and they have asked forgiveness and there has been a cleansing. And I know that Satan will take even a sermon like this that is the truth and twist it in your own mind and relive all those old things. And I want to tell you something. You have been forgiven if you've dealt with it. And in my mind and in the mind of God, Those people who have been involved in this kind of thing now are trophies of God's grace, trophies of God's forgiveness. The angels in heaven rejoice. You were once that way, not anymore. Thank the Lord you've been set free. Don't let Satan have a foothold in that kind of thing as we talk about this. But I also have to say something else, and this is just in wrapping this up. It has to do with something I said last week. you see the real tragedy of Sodom and Gomorrah you remember was not the level of sin that they fell to anything that they had fallen into could have been forgiven no matter how debased and how defiled they had become there could have been forgiveness the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was not the level of their sin the sin of the Pharisee remember that we've just hit the gamut you've got the person in the gutter Sodom and Gomorrah and the Pharisee the upright the righteous but the sin of the Pharisee was not his hypocrisy yes it was I'm sorry, the tragedy of the Pharisee was not his hypocrisy, that could have been forgiven. It wasn't his religious pride, that could have been forgiven. The tragedy of both those people was that when they were living in that sin, they hid it, they accepted it, they denied it, they minimized it, they redefined it, they called it something else. You know what? As I begin to look down at the 8th verse and the verses following, The only thing I can think is this, beloved, we can't get away with that anymore. You say, I can't hide it anymore. I can't accept it anymore. I can't accept the perversion anymore. And you know what else? I can't deny it anymore. You know why? Look at this eighth verse. It says this, you were formerly darkness, but now you're light. Something's happened to you, believer. you know what I want you to think about light and darkness for a minute you know the wonderful thing about darkness the wonderful thing about darkness is I don't see I don't see anything when I'm in darkness fornication looks like love when I'm in darkness my lying looks like truth when I'm in darkness my arrogance looks like strength when I'm in darkness my anger looks like strength then all of a sudden something radical happens to my life and I meet Jesus and you know what happens? I become light. I move out of darkness into life. Another thing, I go from death to life. You know the wonderful thing about death? I don't feel anything. Hey, you could poke me with things. I don't feel anything. Nothing's wrong. Nothing's upsetting. It's all wonderful. And then I come alive and you know the tragedy of coming alive is that I feel things now. I sense things now. And things poke me and I hurt now. And I want to tell you something. I am tired of hearing that the Christian life is some sort of skippity-doo-dah-day thing. It isn't. You walk in the light, you're going to see things about yourself you never saw before, and you're going to have to deal with it now. And you go from death to life, and you're going to feel things like you never felt before. And I'm absolutely convinced that when people really hear the gospel, and they're involved in darkness, one of the biggest decisions they have to make, and one of the things that sometimes keeps them from moving into the light, is realizing that if I do that, I'm going to see. and I'm going to feel and I don't want to. When I was in darkness, my fornication looked like love. Now I'm in the light and now it looks dirty and now I mourn over my sin. When I was in the darkness, my mirrors looked like love but now I'm in the light and it looks like greed. It makes me look like a taker, not a giver. when I was in darkness my church going and involvement looked like Christianity but now I'm opening Ephesians and there's light and my Christianity looks like a shell verse 11 says this do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness but expose them expose them you see the helpless condition that I'm in is not caused by my sin the helpless condition that you feel like you're in right now is not caused by your sin yes it is caused by your sin but the reason you're not moving out of that helpless condition is because you're hiding it or you're denying it or you're redefining it and you're not exposing it to the light verse 13 says but all things become visible when they're exposed by the light. For everything that becomes visible is light. Finally, it's exposed. And I see it. You know what? When I became a believer, I entered into a kind of life that I never anticipated it would be. And when I began to grow, I entered into a kind of lifestyle that I never anticipated it to be. Again, always thinking that it would be light and fluffy, And everything would be wonderful. And all the clouds would roll away. You know the problem with being exposed to the light. Is again. It exposes me as I really am. And then I've got a choice. I can either continue to call my arrogance strength. Or I can call it arrogance. I can continue to call my anger strength. Or I can call it satanic. I can continue to call my love love. Or I can look at it and say. I'm a taker, not a giver. See, now I've got a choice, and when I move into that area of having to make a choice, that's when I've entered into the war that is spoken of in chapter 6, the war of whether I'm going to obey or disobey, whether I'm going to be broken or not. You know, I understand why people sometimes stay away from church. When they stay away from a place where the Word of God is going to be told, and you know why? I would do it too. Because every time I open the Word, I feel exposed. And every time I read about walking in love, I feel exposed. And every time I hear about needing to walk in humility and gentleness and patience and forbearing love, I feel exposed. And every time I hear, Be ye therefore an imitator of God, I feel exposed. And every time I come here, I feel exposed. you see the problem for me isn't do i know what is light and what is dark the problem for me is not do i know what is right and what is wrong the problem for me is will i be broken and will i obey and will i let the light of god touch my heart in such a way that I say I agree with you, that's dirty, that's vile, it needs to be removed. I want to walk like you walk. I want to love like you love. I want to give like you give. Or do I pull down the shade and do the deeds of darkness? Let's pray. Father, I think you're teaching us that being a believer is about growth. It's about being changed and stretched. Father, give us the insight to see where your light is shining in our life. And then give us the courage to submit to those areas that need to be given to you. I ask these things in your name. Amen. Amen.
