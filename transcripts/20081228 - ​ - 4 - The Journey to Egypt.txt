Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. My name is Jen Linwell. I'm on staff here as the Metro Impact Pastor. In the weeks leading up to Christmas, Steve invited us to imagine what it must have been like for Mary to receive an unexpected invitation to give birth to the Son of God. We've been trying to figure out how this teenage girl could possibly say, let it be unto me as you say, to something this insanely life-changing. And we've been using Mary's story as an example for how we can say yes to the unexpected invitations, not by merely trying to handle them and control them and manage them, but by really receiving them, like Mary did. Believing that if we choose to receive the invitations God calls us into, just like the life of Jesus grew in Mary, literally, in a similar way, the life of Jesus would grow in us in significant ways, and we would begin to be able to extend that life to the people around us. And so over the past few weeks, I have found myself just reflecting on and really drawn to the idea of what it's like to have the life of Jesus growing in me. And I don't just mean a salvific life or some assurance of eternal life after death, because when I think of the life that was growing in Mary, I think of a living, breathing life that healed and touched and loved people. And it's amazing for me to think that that same type of life could be growing in you, and it could be growing in me. Henry Nowen says in his book Here and Now, the great mystery of the spiritual life, the life in God, is that we don't have to wait for it is something that will happen later. It's the active presence of God at the center of our living. So to think that this life could spring up in me in some of the dry and deserted places, it could grow into some of those empty spaces. It could begin to impact the people around me by loving and healing and touching them. And this is the life of God that we are invited to have grow in each of us. I was recently having a coffee with a friend from Open Door, and she told me that her and her husband were quitting their jobs, putting their furniture in storage, and moving to Chile. Now, I started thinking about this and realizing that they have a lot of great friends here, good jobs, a neighborhood they really like, and so my first reaction to her was, why? I mean, what could you possibly want to do in Chile? And she told me they've been accepted to teach at a local school for a year, and they were going to live in a little apartment and learn Spanish. But what they really hoped to do was to have a year to be together, work on their marriage, ride their bikes, cook food, dream about their future, and let some of the things that they valued take root and grow into their lives. Why are you going to do this now? I asked her. And I learned that her and her husband had been on a journey of asking what it meant for them to follow Jesus. They sensed that his life was growing inside of them, but they got stuck in a rut. And though it was hard for them to leave the people and the life they had here, they were so maxed out in the day-to-day schedule, they had no time to think about how following Jesus was going to impact the rest of their lives. So if we don't go to Chile now, she said, this life inside of us might die. And that is not a risk we're willing to take. Have you ever met someone like that? Where the need to go there, to be with them, to do this, is so strong that they are certain if they don't, something in them may die. Maybe you've been that person who said yes to God in some big or small way and you got a taste of this life, and even though you didn't understand it, you knew it had to live. This morning, I want us to ask this question. what does it mean to protect and nurture the life of God that's growing inside of us let's pray as we dive in God we consider it truly an honor and a privilege that you would allow your life to grow in us and we are humbled by that reality and so give us just the eyes to see the ears to hear what you're calling us to in terms of nurturing and protecting and growing that life. Pray this in Jesus' name, amen. Well, I spent a lot of time in my life imagining and celebrating the event of the birth of Jesus. Like many of you, I spent the better part of this past week at Christmas festivities eating and drinking and playing and singing and thinking about this event. But I have given little to no thought about what the morning after, or even the hours after the birth of Jesus, were like. And I guess when I did, I imagined Jesus, the baby, lying in a manger, sleeping peacefully with animals snoring on all sides, Mary and Joseph spooning on a bale of hay nearby. You guys all know the image, right? But if you actually read the rest of the Christmas story, then you know that is nothing like how it went. In fact, that image could not be farther from the truth. Because after Mary and Joseph said yes to the invitation to carry and birth this life, and after they had gone to great lengths and sacrificed much to bring this life into the world, we learn that this life was threatened. Shortly after the birth of Jesus, Herod found out that the Savior had been born in Bethlehem. And because this was so threatening to him, he made a plan to go and kill the newborn baby Jesus. And so in the first hours of Jesus' life, his life's being threatened. Read with me in Matthew 2, starting in verse 13. It says, I want to invite you to put yourself in Mary's shoes again, as we've been doing the last several weeks. And think about this with me for a second. You are a virgin who is told that you're having a baby. Not just any baby, but the Son of God. So you've gone through your pregnancy, the nausea, the fatigue, the sleepless nights. You have journeyed to Bethlehem nine months pregnant, and you have birthed a child in less than optimal conditions. You are exhausted. And just when you think it's time to relax and celebrate the new life, you get word from your husband that you are going to pack up and go to another country. In verse 14, it says, Joseph got up and took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt. So from the sounds of this verse, it seemed like there was little to no hesitation on their part to go. It sounds like they went that very night. And we were talking about this during message team a few weeks ago, and I commented that I can't believe they went. You know, ever since I gave birth to a child, all these pregnancy childbirth metaphors sort of take on new meaning. And I feel like I process them in a whole different way. So when I was a new mom, I couldn't find time to brush my teeth. I mean, I spent my time alternating between feeding, diapering, burping, trying to get a little sleep myself. And so when I think about Mary's story, I'm imagining someone coming to me when my daughter Esme is one day old and telling me that this fragile little life is in trouble and I have to get on a plane and fly to Europe that very day. I mean, this seems inconceivable to me. And I don't know if I would have even had enough energy at that point to think about a journey like that. But as I finished my little rant at Message Team, someone turned to me, I think it was Dave, and he said, of course they'd go without hesitating. I mean, think about everything they'd done to bring this life into existence. This was literally their only choice to keep this life alive. I started thinking about that life that was once inside Mary's womb and how it was now out here. it wasn't just this little life growing inside it was a life that was now exposed to the world and there was a new kind of protection that was needed to keep it alive and so Mary and Joseph had no choice but to go to Egypt to protect the life of Jesus even if they had no idea what they were doing they knew they would do anything to keep that life alive and so they went and we don't really get any information about what the journey was like, what they did when they were there how long they were there, but we do know that Jesus' life was spared from the hand of Herod. And after Herod died, Mary and Joseph brought their newborn baby back home. And for the next several years, they fed him and clothed him and taught him and loved him and raised him. And this one small, fragile baby became a man. Not just any man, but the man who would extend a kind of life of God to other people that was beyond anything they had ever imagined. This little life grew to be the one who would say in John 10 10, I have come that they may have life and have it to the full. Or as many translations say, have it abundantly. And so if Mary and Joseph lived till they were 80, I wonder what they would say when they reflected back on that escape to Egypt. I wonder if it would be something like, wow, we really had no idea what we were doing. I guess we just went because we knew we had to protect that life. And look what that life grew to be. And we see Jesus as a man who was constantly inviting people to receive the life of God inside them, extending forgiveness of their sins, healing them from sickness and death. But Jesus never stopped there, because as people accepted the life that he offered by agreeing to follow or obey or be healed, he called them to let that life grow and mature and permeate into every area of their lives. I have come to give you life and life to the fullest. He said, so Jesus often asked a follow-up question or gave a follow-up command where I think he was in essence saying, now do you want this life to survive? Because there is a fuller life that you can grab hold of. But you can't let this life in you die. You have to protect it. And I think Jesus knew that the invitation to let that life grow would look different for everyone, which is exactly why he didn't give the same command to all the people who receive the life of God inside of them. And if we believe Jesus is really calling people to a more abundant life, let's look at, let's lay that over some of the interactions he had with people and just look at these interactions through that lens. I want to start with the rich young ruler, which we find in Luke 18. You've probably heard this story many times. A rich young man comes to Jesus, eager to learn from who he calls the good teacher, and hoping that he's going to be assured of his own salvation. And so he asked Jesus, what must I do to inherit eternal life? And Jesus answers him in verse 20. You know the commandments. Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud. Honor your father and mother. Teacher, he declared, all of these I have kept since I was a boy. Jesus looked at him and loved him. One thing you lack, he said, go sell everything you have and give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come follow me. In part, I think Jesus was saying here, young man, you have kept the commandments well, and as a result, the life of God is growing in you. But if you are serious about keeping that life alive, about letting it take root and grow, then this is what you have to do. Sell everything, give it away, and come follow me. And I know it sounds crazy, but I know your story, and I know you, and this is what you have to do. We read the young man's response in verse 23. It says, when he heard this, he became very sad because he was very wealthy. What does his response tell us? Jesus hit the nail right on the head. Jesus knew that for this man, it was his wealth that could potentially kill the life of God inside of him. Jesus doesn't give this instruction to everyone. Look at another story with me. Again, believing that Jesus is calling people to a more full, abundant life in his commands to them. We read of a man who was healed of leprosy in Matthew 8. The man comes to Jesus and asks to be made clean, and Jesus reaches out his hand and touches the man. And immediately, we read in Matthew 8, 3, he is cleansed of his leprosy. But after Jesus does this, he gives the man a command. Jesus says in Matthew 8, 4, See that you don't tell anyone, but go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded as a testimony to them. Why would Jesus do that? Could there have been an invitation to a fuller life in this opportunity to stay silent for this man? Something that Jesus wanted the man to see or hear or experience by remaining silent about what he'd experienced for a time? A third story, where Jesus gives a totally different command, is found in Mark 5. There's a man who's possessed by demons who comes to Jesus for help. Jesus restores him and heals him and gives him a command. In Mark 5, 19, Jesus says, Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, how he has had mercy on you. So Jesus is telling this man not to be silent, but to go and speak and tell the people what has happened. So could there be an invitation to a fuller, more abundant life for this man as he goes and speaks that truth to other people? What if for the rich young ruler it was his wealth that could have killed the life inside him. And for the man with leprosy, it was saying too much too soon. And for the man possessed by demons, it was not saying enough or staying silent for too long. All different people, all with different stories. And as Jesus extended the life of God to them, he looked into their lives and their stories and identified the things that could potentially kill the life of God inside them. So he called them to do something that would nurture and grow and protect that life. And just as Jesus did it when he walked on this earth, I believe he does it with us now. He invites us to have the life of God inside us, but then he calls us to continue to allow that life to grow. Have you ever felt that there was something in your life that could quickly or slowly kill the life of God inside you? Or have you ever felt that there was something you just had to do to keep the life in you from dying? When Ben and I were first married, we lived in an apartment in Roseville. And it was at that time we began to attend Open Door and started to be really challenged to think about our faith in God in ways we never had before. Wondering if what we believed about who Jesus was should actually impact how we lived our lives. And we started hearing about this God who loved everyone with a special heart for the least and the lost and the last. And a Jesus who called the people around him to go to the marginalized in society. And so we started asking ourselves what it meant for us to follow this God, this Jesus. But as we started looking around ourselves, we noticed something. Everyone in our lives was pretty much just like us. Where we lived and worked and went to school, our friends and families were made up of people who looked and talked and thought and believed and acted just like us. And we sensed that God was calling us to something more. There was this new life of Jesus and following him that was growing in us, a seed of something that was taking root, and we didn't want to let it die. It was around this time that we started looking for a house, and we really had no idea what we were doing. But it became clear to us that for us to continue to nurture this life inside us, we needed to go somewhere that was unfamiliar to us. A place where ideas about how the world works and what's important and what it means to be successful would be challenged. A place where people who were different than us might make us uncomfortable, but would give us a fuller understanding of the world that God created and loves. And so we'd been hearing about Open Doors connections to Minneapolis, specifically North Minneapolis, and we knew that for us, living in an urban area with people of all different racial and ethnic backgrounds and different socioeconomic statuses would be really out of our comfort zone. And so we literally just started searching by Northside zip codes until we found a house that we liked, and we bought it. I'm not trying to give an example of how perfectly we did this, because trust me, we didn't. But looking back, that move literally saved us in many ways. And it didn't look that way to our families and friends. Actually, to them, it looked more like a danger than a protection. But to us, it was a call to Egypt. And it was based on more than meets the eye. it was based on something that was happening on the inside. Shortly after moving into our house, we were faced with another situation. You know, when we first moved into our house, it seemed huge to us. Many of you might remember that first move from your apartment to the house. In your apartment, you have a couple hundred square feet, you've got your car table, your thrift store couch. And since we couldn't fit our thrift store couch to the door of our new house, our new house seemed even bigger and huger and emptier. But we kept getting this message from our family and friends. You'll fill it up. You just wait another year, a kid or two, and you won't believe this house ever seemed big at all. In fact, you'll need a bigger house for all your stuff. And on one hand, that was really appealing to me. I mean, I started thinking of all these ways we could use the extra space, these things we could buy that would fill up the space. But there was something inside us that said, well, what if we didn't want to fill it up? I mean, let's just say we didn't want to outgrow this house in a year or two. Because another thing we'd been hearing a lot about at Open Door was around our stuff and the need to get away from thinking everything we had should be clung to and hoarded. There was something changing in how we were viewing our stuff, and though it was really scary, it was giving us life. And so we felt this invitation to keep that life growing, and we wondered what it meant for us to try to hold our positions loosely in this season and let ourselves be connected to the people around us in community. And so we decided to try this kind of crazy thing of having people live in our house with us. And for the past three years, we have. We lived with a couple, we lived with a mother and daughter, with a couple single people, and more recently with a couple and their two-year-old son. Did we do this perfect? No. And did we make a lot of mistakes? Yes. But I look back at this decision as another significant step to continue to nurture and grow the life of God in our family. And though we did keep from filling up our entire house with more stuff, we received many much, much, much more valuable gifts as a result. Just to name a few, we learned about how our everyday decisions impact the people we're in community with. Or how to be more intentional about respecting each other with our words and in conflict in our marriage with friends looking on. Or how we submit to and respect different parenting styles and choices. Now hear me say this, I am not suggesting that everyone moves to North Minneapolis or that you all invite your friends to move into your house. In fact, that is probably most likely what you're not supposed to do. That was our journey. Because just like Jesus called the leper and the demon-possessed man and the rich young ruler to different things, he called us to something. And he's calling you to something. And so today I invite you to wonder, what does it look like for you to go to Egypt? Because in reality, we are all called to nurture and grow the life of God inside of us, even though it's going to look different for each of us. And despite those differences, I think there will be some similarities in our journeys. I'm going to take the rest of our time this morning to just talk about a couple of those. One commonality I believe this journey to Egypt will have is that it will most likely lead us to places we don't want to go. In other words, it will lead us to the margins of our own lives, the places where we're uncomfortable, uncertain, not quite sure if we have what it takes to be successful. I believe that Mary and Joseph felt ill-equipped to bring their newborn baby to a foreign country. But as Steve said a few weeks ago, it's this type of space where we're not sure if we have what it takes, where we're most open to ask God for help and to really partner with him in what he's doing around us. I told you a bit about the journey of moving to North Minneapolis, and when we moved in, it did seem a little bit like an adventure, like something we kind of really wanted to do. But as I look back over the past three and a half years, there have been hundreds, if not thousands of times, where it was the last place on earth I wanted to be. Because as we've gotten into relationship with the people around us, things have gotten messy. About a year ago, we were trying to help a neighbor out, and we ended up being misunderstood by another neighbor, who responded by spreading a rumor about us to a bunch of our other neighbors. And we didn't know this was going on, but we noticed that a few of our neighbors were starting to treat us really strangely, starting to kind of avoid us. And so I remember the afternoon I finally found out, it was exposed what had been happening in our neighborhood. And I thought, you know what? I don't have to do this. I don't want to do this. I don't want to be involved in this messy, chaotic thing anymore. I don't understand what's going on. I can't figure out how to communicate with the people around me. And I really do not want to clear up this mess, because I have no idea how I would even start to do that. But I knew that if I was going to survive another summer on our block, I had to. And so even though it was the last thing on earth I wanted to do, I marched over to my neighbor's house, knocked on the door, sat on her porch, and let her say her piece. But then she let me say mine. And the misunderstanding became a little bit clearer. She apologized, I apologized, she stopped saying things to our other neighbors, and so when I found myself in this place I didn't want to be, this uncomfortable place where I had no choice but to deal with the conflict, I was forced to move towards my neighbor with compassion, to listen to her, to get her perspective, and my need to be right, which is something I often cling to that can kill the life of God inside of me, was put to the side. And instead, there was a little bit of space for the life of God in me to grow in that interaction. And so this journey to Egypt, I believe, will most likely lead us to the places in our lives that are uncomfortable. Where we don't have our act together, where maybe we don't want to be, but I believe that God will meet us in those places. Second thing these journeys will probably have in common, how you're called to protect this life may not make sense to you. By all the logic and reason and common sense that your brain can muster up, it may actually seem ridiculous. Like traveling to a foreign country with a newborn, like giving all you have and giving it to the poor. But it doesn't have to make sense to you because things are not always what they seem. And how I think I should protect my life may be different than how God's calling me to do that. I'm not saying we should live a life with no boundaries, with no regard for safety that we should do, no planning or protecting for our life or our children's lives. We have to listen to the people who are in community with us. Sometimes we have to trust our gut instinct on things. So don't hear me say that we should all do something reckless, like quit our jobs and start a commune in South America, though I maybe would if anyone wanted to. I'm merely proposing that we don't let our reason and our intellect be the only guiding force in how we discern the journey of God inside us. That we acknowledge that what looks like safety and security to us could actually be the most detrimental thing to the life of God inside of us. And what seems ridiculous or dangerous could be the very thing that God is intending to sustain and grow that life. A third thing that I think will be similar on our journeys to Egypt is that there will be a continual yes to keep this life from dying. This will not be a one-time decision, and though there may be those bigger decisions, a job change, a move. Just like Mary and Joseph may have considered that journey to Egypt as a big step, it was followed for them by hundreds of thousands of continual yeses to keep the life of Jesus alive. I've gotten to know a wonderful guy recently who quit his corporate job after 25 years to buy up a couple houses in North Minneapolis, one of which he rents to young urban poets and one of which he has created an urban retreat space in. He's an amazing guy with an amazing story. And it's clear that he heard an invitation from God to do this. But as I listen to what his life has been like since that big decision, here is what I heard. There has been a continual yes every day to the small things, the hard things, the this-does-not-make-sense-to-me things. And that continual yes was required for the work of God to continue in his life. And so there could be the big decision, a move, a job change, but that is just the beginning. It's not the destination. Because we couldn't move to North Minneapolis and just deadbolt our doors and wipe our hands clean, even though I wanted to, and there's been times when I've done that. The real work continued when we opened the door and sat on the porch and said hello to a neighbor. And so there's this continual yes that we all have to agree to every single day on this journey. Now I imagine there's a few people out there who are like, yes, where do I sign up? I am all about moving to Chile. In fact, that sounds great. I would love to get out of here. But here's something for you to consider. What if the most radical thing that you could do to grow the life of God in you was the most mundane thing you can possibly imagine? What if the most radical thing that you could possibly do to protect the life of God in you is the most mundane thing you could imagine? See, it's easy for us to hear about this journey to Egypt and think, yes, that's what I need. I need to quit my job and do something more fulfilling and more valuable. Then the life of God will really begin to grow. Then I'll really start to change. then things will really get moving in my life but that may not be the answer for you. You know, I told a few stories about times in my family where we made decisions to keep the life of God in us from dying that seemed more radical to us. And we were in another such situation last spring. We had a new baby and two full-time jobs. Our life was getting really crazy and we began to fear that the life in our family and marriage would begin to die if we didn't make a change. And so we decided that my husband Ben would quit his full-time job and start spending most of his days at home caring for our daughter Esme. This was a really big change for him and a really big change for us, just as it would be for anyone. And staying at home doesn't exactly sound like the most amazing, radical, exciting thing, does it? I mean, isn't radical stuff doing ministry or being a pastor or being a missionary? Ben gave me permission to share a blog entry from his very first day as a stay-at-home parent. This is what he wrote. I have been telling myself that a new life is starting. Today I begin disciplines of servanthood and contemplation. Washing diapers, dishes, and laundry are no longer just the simple tasks of the household for me. It's the new work of my hands for the benefit of our tiny intentional community and my own spiritual formation. I fully expect the washing to be an inner and an outer work. Ever so slowly, even monotonously, I hope to work into my character the ways and attitudes of Jesus Christ. It's pretty amazing, huh? For Ben, the most radical thing that he could do for the life of God in him, in our marriage, and our family may look like the most mundane thing imaginable to some people. But I can already tell you this radical decision has saved us from experiencing a kind of death in our family. And so if leaving it all behind and going to Chile sounds good to you, consider that God may be inviting you to nurture that life by staying in your job or your marriage or your neighborhood. The journey to Egypt for you may be continuing to live with that annoying roommate or listening to your child read the same story every day or coming home after work every night and unloading the dishwasher again. Does this whole thing sound kind of tiring to anybody else? I mean, this seems like a really exhausting, challenging way to do life. To think that the life of God grows in me when I'm challenged and stretched and when it all feels like too much and doesn't make sense. To think I have to say yes to this every day and that it's going to look like things in my life dying, maybe my image, my dreams, my success. But I believe and I have experienced in small ways that there is a life that I can take hold of that is richer and fuller and truer than anything I've imagined. And so I hold on to this. This journey to Egypt, though difficult, will not just give me life, it will give me the fullest life that Jesus has promised. And what's more is as it grows, I will have something to extend and offer to people who come to me in search of life. And we see so clearly in the life of Christ that we serve a God who is about relationship. And so allowing the life of Jesus to grow in us will lead us to those relational places. Who we are as a spouse, a friend, a parent, a child, a neighbor, an employee. And the life of Christ in me will be a love and a peace and a compassion that invites them to experience an abundant life in Christ. so do you believe that life inside you is worth protecting and are you willing to go to egypt to allow it to grow it is a season of new year's resolutions and many of us find ourselves looking back on the year past maybe with some regret maybe with some joy probably a mix of accomplishment and maybe some sadness but we look forward to the new year with new commitments and new promises we're finally going to get to the gym five times a week we're finally going to balance our checkbook we're going to get the garage cleaned out at my house and those things can be really good but what if this year your resolution didn't have anything to do with what you think needed to change about your life what if you spent some time thinking about what God might want to do to grow his life inside of you maybe the resolution for you this year is to begin the journey to Egypt so that life in you, in your marriage, in your family won't die. So what does it look like for you to go to Egypt? Is it a big change in your job, your family, where you live? Or is it committing to another year of doing what you've been doing? Whatever it is for you, I believe your yes to protect and nurture the life in you will not only teach you about a fuller, truer life that's being given to you by Christ, but you will have a greater understanding of how you're being called to partner with God to accomplish his purposes in our world. Pray with me. God, we believe that this life is the only life, and it's the only place from which we can get true life, And so may we put aside the fears we have and maybe our own agendas for our lives and ask you, even in this next year, how can we nurture and grow and protect your life in us? Give us the courage and strength we need to do that. We pray this in Jesus' name, amen. And I just want to invite you to stand and I'd like to read a benediction over you. This comes out of Colossians 3, verses 1 through 4. You can follow along up on the screen. So if you're serious about living this new life with Christ, act like it. Pursue the things over which Christ presides. Don't shuffle along, eyes to the ground. Absorb with the things right in front of you. Look up and be alert to what's going on around Christ. That's where the action is. See things from his perspective. your old life is dead your new life which is your real life even though invisible to spectators is with Christ in God he is your life when Christ your real life remember shows up again on this earth you'll show up to the real you the glorious you meanwhile be content with obscurity like Christ peace as you go this week thanks Thank you.
