Well, good morning, everyone. My name is Jen Linwall, and I'm on staff here as the Metro Impact Associate Pastor. You know, some of you have been coming to Opendoor for just a couple weeks or months. Some of you have called Opendoor your home for decades. But I think we've all realized something. This place, like every place, has a story. My husband Ben and I have been attending here for about four years, and it's been so cool to get to trace the journey of this place through decades of history. This fall seems like it's been a really special time to do that, with things like a five-year celebration and the beginning of foundations on Wednesday evenings. And as a result of these reflections, I think we've noticed something. There are some themes that we can trace all the way through the existence of this place, through the Crystal Building, through Robbinsdale, and into Earl Brown, and things that we've brought with us to this building in Maple Grove. To borrow a phrase from Dave, there are some things that are in our DNA here at Open Door. and one of those major themes that can be weaved all the way through these decades is a commitment to care for the poor. We've been challenged to show concern for the marginalized hundreds if not thousands of times. We've talked about how reaching out to the poor is one of the ways we participate in the essence of who God is. That when we care for the poor in our midst, we join God in his desire to redeem and restore the entire world. You know that commitment is one of the things that first drew me into this place. Ben and I were remembering when we would sit out in those seats, we'd listen to Ephraim Smith and Tom Johnson and Steve, and we knew we want to be part of a place that has this kind of commitment, that has care and concern for the poor at the center of what it's about. This past spring, we started on a new journey with Jesus, where we began to wonder about the way Jesus lived and how we could follow him as our rabbi. And as we got deeper and deeper into this study, the last three weeks we looked at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount, Blessed are the poor in spirit. I think we've seen this theme of those on the fringes come up again and again. We've noticed that Jesus keeps calling his followers into care for the poor. He seems to exalt and lift up the most destitute people in society. He even makes examples out of them for his followers to follow. I mean, we've known that care for the poor was a big deal for years. But I think lately we're wondering if maybe it's a little bit bigger deal than we thought. Maybe this idea of paying attention to the least is more central to following Jesus than we imagined. For me, something unexpected happened about two and a half years ago when I came on staff here. And I found that this idea of care for the poor in this place was something I thought more than three hours a week about. In fact, I spent about every day wondering how we could take this commitment and turn it into something that would work in a large church setting. I mean, what should we do? What should we collect? Where should we give money to? Where should we volunteer? And around that time, I started looking around and noticing that caring for the poor was pretty popular even. You know, I would get hundreds of pieces of mail in my mailbox about summits and urban leadership and books that were coming out about care for the poor. I'd be in the line at the grocery store and I'd see a famous person on the cover of a magazine who just took a trip to Africa to try to end world hunger. And so I found myself wondering, how is Open Door going to be cutting edge in how we approach the poor? What kind of language are we going to use? What kind of programs are we going to run? But then we started this journey with the rabbi, and it kind of messed me up a little bit. Maybe it did that for a lot of us, actually. Because I found myself not asking questions like, what should we collect or where should we volunteer? I found myself asking, why is Jesus inviting us to care for the poor? I mean, I understand that this is something he commands, but am I missing something if I just skip to the programs and the collections? There has to be something in this journey, right? Beyond food drives, beyond volunteering, something that the rabbi is trying to invite us into. when he commands us to care for the poor among us. And a few weeks ago, when Dave talked about sacred space, he shared with us this concept called axis mundi, which is the point which everything revolves around. He outlined that we tend to approach our lives with ourself as the center. That way we remain in control, and our agenda and our ideas can dictate how we live our life. This makes sense. But see, when we are at the center of our lives, something really unfortunate happens. It keeps us from entering into a sacred space. That place where we're not focused on ourselves and our agenda, but where we're actually open to what God might be calling us to do in the world. So I sat there this whole time wondering how this plays out in terms of our care for the poor. I mean, if we fight to keep ourselves at the center of every situation in our lives, why would our approach to the marginalized be an exception? and this is a problem we care we want to do something we know we need to do something but how do we figure out what this invitation really is i think the solution lies in the real invitation of a rabbi and today i want us to journey together to wonder together what this invitation is in regards to the poor i want to look at how this invitation is going to knock us out of the center which might be a bit scary but it's going to allow us enter into a sacred space where we can be open to what God is really calling us to do as individuals and as a church. And I'd love to just pray before we get started. God, we are seeking your invitation for us in so many ways, and today I ask that we're mindful of your spirit moving among us as a community and just in our individual lives. Amen. So if we're going to spend the next several minutes talking about the poor, I just want to take a moment to ask an important question. Who are the poor? Some of you might have been here when I spoke in the spring, and we spent a significant amount of time trying to find that. Who are the poor? And I think we discovered something sort of surprising. I think we discovered that the terms the poor might include a group a lot larger than we thought. When we hear the word the poor, a lot of us think of kids in Africa who literally have nothing. And they are poor. We think of people we know who are struggling to put food on the table. They are poor. But I want to invite you today, as you hear the terms the poor, to expand who comes to your mind, to recognize the poverty in your family, in your friends, in your community, in yourself, spiritual, emotional, physical poverty. And so when you hear the term the poor, think of the people in Minneapolis who are homeless and don't have any material wealth. But think of the person you work with every day who lacks wealth in their relationships. Think of the kids in Africa who have nothing to eat today. We have to think of them. But also think of that neighbor you have who seems sad almost all the time. I also need to tell you before we get into this that I did not discover the exact path that we need to follow to enter into this. I would have loved to jump up here today with a three-step plan on how Church of the Open Door in Maple Grove is going to move from being merely charitable to being a radically transformative church, changing the world with our commitment to the poor. And I think I could have made something up, but I really don't think it would have worked. So I just want to share with you some of my wonderings about this journey this morning. And this is the first question I want to ask. How are we currently approaching our care for the poor? Here's what I think happens most of the time with large suburban churches, and with a lot of us as individuals. We come to see we have to care about the poor. We might not explore it too deeply, but we know that being part of a church means doing generous, charitable things. So we jump to fill that requirement. We collect food, we write checks, we volunteer. And I think we do that with really good intentions most of the time. We do it because we're commanded to, but we do it because we feel compassion. We do it because we want to help. We do it to fulfill our duty as a church. Sometimes I think we do it to make ourselves feel a little bit better. Now let me just stop for one second so there's not confusion. I think it is so important that we do something. I think action is a huge, huge part of this commitment. So I don't want to discount hundreds of thousands of amazing charitable efforts going on in this place and around the world. But I just think there has to be something more to this invitation to care for the poor. This chance to participate in the redemption and restoration of the world to bring justice on this earth. It can't just be about learning to be a charitable church or a charitable person. I think I started my work here at Open Door with this kind of mindset. But it didn't take me long to stop for just a second and ask. You know, we can collect things till we're blue in the face, a lot of things. But is that really what it's all about? I mean, it's about following Jesus, right? And we're doing the best to care for poor because we believe that's what he wants us to do. but I think to do that we have to really enter in to what he's inviting us to. You know some Christians spend a lot of time thinking about the end times and judgment day. I have no idea what this is going to look like but last week I was reading Matthew 25 and we're giving this image of Jesus on the throne separating the sheep from the goats and he's doing this based on how they cared for the least among them and I found myself wondering what would that look like? I mean would Jesus line people up and have a clipboard and say, okay, if you collected 100 coats at your church, raise your hand. And everyone who raised their hand would get to go through. Okay, if you volunteered this many hours in your adult life, raise your hand, go on through. And I think you get my point, and I think we can say with confidence, there's no way it's going to look like that. But we kind of dedicate a lot of our efforts to this type of approach. I mean, we feel compassion for poverty around us. And we get excited about an effort or an idea or an agenda or some results we could get, and we jump right in. And though I think a lot of good things come out of this, I think it's just a disconnected and charitable approach to the poor. And here's what I think it really is at its essence. I think it's a care for the poor with us at the center. I think it's the way that we can manage our care for the poor in a way that allows us to keep our agenda foremost. Let me just tell you a couple stories to illustrate my point. I used to be on staff at a non-profit in the Phillips neighborhood in South Minneapolis, and we survived largely because of the donations of suburban churches and wealthy individuals. And one day the doorbell rang, a co-worker of mine answered it, and there was this woman standing there. He said if he had to stereotype, she looked like she was upper middle class, she had on a really nice outfit and a new car, and her three daughters were in the back. And she said, um, hi sir, my daughters and I have five dollars and we'd like it to give it to one of the kids you're helping. And he said, well, you know, that's perfect because we're going out this week and buying them all school shoes so they can have shoes for school next week. I'd love to take the five dollars and put it towards that. The woman kind of stopped and she said, are there any kids here right now we could give the money to? And my friend stopped and thought and knew that the least helpful and sustainable way to help these kids would be to give them $5. But he paused. He said, well, ma'am, I think the best use of your money is going to be to put it towards a pair of these school shoes because these kids really need shoes for school next week. And she kind of shifted a little bit and looked at her feet, and then she looked up, and she said, see, we just really want to see the look on the kid's face when we give them the $5. I think that woman probably went home confused about that encounter. I mean, she was trying to help, right? She was trying to provide an experience of giving for her and her family. But it doesn't take long to figure out who was at the center of that experience. Another story, there was a group of college students working at a school and they discovered that a lot of the students in the school didn't have beds. So they came up with this great idea. They called a local furniture store and they were able to buy the beds at cost and have them delivered to the school. But there was some disagreement about how it would work out. Because the plan was to have the parents of the kids come and pick up the beds and put them together. And here's what some of the college students said. If the parents come and get the beds, the kids will think that the parents bought them. They won't know the work that we put in to make this happen. They won't know that we made this happen. Because when you're at the center of a situation, you might not realize that one of the most important things a 10-year-old kid in an under-resourced community could feel was safe and secure by what their parents could provide for them. If you're at the center, you might not realize that this could allow a family to have a Saturday, like so many of us already do, where they go and pick up something new, they put it together at home, and then they celebrate. Like the woman, you might not realize that what kids really need sometimes is a new pair of school shoes. Because when you're at the center, the most important thing is that you see results, that you have control over the outcome, that you receive the credit that you think you deserve and that you get to feel good about what you did. But here's what I'm kind of wondering. What if, like the birth of a child or like the death of a loved one, what if our contact with the poor and relationship with the poor is one of the main ways God wants to use to knock us out of the center? I mean, it makes sense. God knew how easy it would be for people who were wealthy to put themselves at the center of their lives. And Jesus knew that this would make it very difficult to really follow him. Because if people were at the center, they would dedicate all their energy to hoarding their wealth, to building their empires, to preserving their way. They'd be arrogant and think they had all the answers. And so maybe Jesus kept drawing people in to care for the poor so they wouldn't have to fight so hard against all those things. There's this phrase in Matthew 26, 11 where Jesus says, the poor will always be among you. And I've heard that verse used to justify complacency towards the poor, as if Jesus was saying, you can't do anything about poverty. There's always gonna be poor people. But recently I heard a different twist. Maybe Jesus knew that if people were really his followers, that's where they would be found, among the poor. A well-known author recently paraphrased the verse this way. Look, you will always have the poor with you because you're my disciples. You know who we spend our time with, who we share our meals with, who listens to our message, and who we focus our attention on. You've been watching me and you know my priorities. You know who comes first in the kingdom of God so you will always be near the poor. I mean, honestly, if your best friend was a beggar with leprosy, who you cared about and who cared about you, do you really think you'd be at risk of spending your whole life dedicated to building your own empire and hoarding your resources for yourself? It's not likely. And I think we've all experienced this on some level. You know that encountering poverty in a real way, whether it's physical, emotional, spiritual, has the potential to knock you out of the center of your life. Some of us maybe was watching a documentary or hearing a sermon or having a conversation with a friend who was having a really hard time. Some of us it was hanging out in North Minneapolis or serving a meal at a food shelf. We have this experience and we start to feel this sort of teetering feeling, like we might lose control. And I think at that moment we make a choice. We choose one of two things and they have very different results. The first choice is to actually stop clinging to the center. To stop trying to remain in control of our lives. And I got one of those images of the merry-go-rounds. I don't know if they make those anymore at the parks. And you wrap yourself around the center bar. And as somebody starts pushing you around, the force of gravity tries to pull you out. And you feel your hands slipping. And all of a sudden, you let go. And you fly out, going who knows where. it's sort of fun, it's pretty scary makes you feel like you might throw up and I want to come back to that scenario the other way we go is by actually using the experience and encountering the poor to settle further into our seat in the center and here I get this image of us all in really comfortable chairs I don't know what your chair of choice is maybe it's a leather recliner or something for me it's one of those papasan chairs with all the pillows so picture yourself in your comfortable chair at the center of the universe with a bowl of popcorn and a remote in your hand, and you start to feel this teetering feeling like you're going to lose control, and you say, no, I am going to settle further down into this chair. I'm going to get a little bit more comfortable here. And I've had hundreds of experiences like this. I remember one when I was in high school. I grew up in the suburbs and didn't get into the city much at all. And so some friends and I decided to do something downtown. And as we were coming off the highway down the ramp, I saw this guy holding a sign. I think he was asking for food or money. And I thought, there has got to be an explanation for this. I mean, I live in the land of plenty, the land of opportunity. This guy must have done something really wrong to miss out on the comfortable suburban life that I have. And as I pulled up near him, he teetered a bit to the left. And that's when I knew it. He was an alcoholic. He had spent all of his money and all of his family money on alcohol. And this predicament he was in was for sure his fault. This was not my problem. And so I used the experience there to settle further down into my comfortable seat instead of letting God maybe use it to move me out of the center just a little bit. And I've chosen to do that many, many times since that day. Tried to scoot further and further down into my seat. I've justified my way out of a lot of hard questions and I have fought hard to stay in control and at the center of my life. But for some reason, within the past few years, it's been getting harder and harder. And the more I have an opportunity to be in relationship with people who are in poverty, the more of those merry-go-round type experiences I'm having. The ones that throw me out of the center, that shake up my world, that blow out my box. Here's a personal story of such an experience. As many of you can tell, my husband and I have been on an interesting journey of pregnancy lately. And I just have to tell you something. Dave offered me $20 to fake going into labor up here. I'm serious. And I'm not going to do it. So if it happens, it's a real thing. You know, I imagine this is a pretty eventful journey for anyone who's on it. And I imagine it's normal to spend a lot of time figuring out how you're going to keep a child alive when you can't water plants, when you can't seem to do anything. I've killed three aloe plants in the last two years. But not long into this journey, Ben and I realized something unique was going to happen. We were going to go through it with one of our neighbors. But instead of leading to couple powwows and discussions of the newest baby books like you might imagine, we found ourselves thrown out of the center. Because our neighbor Nia is 14 years old. She's a sophomore in high school and the father of her baby is already in prison on drug charges. She lives with her mom and five siblings. Her youngest sister is five years old and is an aunt three times. and it hit me. These kids are going to be born in the same city a couple months apart in houses that are literally 50 feet apart but in actuality they're being born thousands of miles apart and as Ben and I sit over here and wonder what month to introduce our child to solid food a child is going to grow up across the street with a completely different experience. A life with completely different opportunities. Because Nia is 14 years old. And Nia does not have the support of her friends and family that she needs to raise a child. And this child will live in a house that is filled with yelling and screaming and filth and cat urine. And there is nothing I can do to change that. And all of a sudden it hit me that no act, big or small, that I could come up with could make me feel better. nothing I could conjure up would put me back in the center. I thought of some things. Maybe we could buy some stuff for the baby. I could say an encouraging anecdote about how everything will work out to be just fine. But that would be a lie. I could not give this a quick fix and just retreat back into the comfort of my life. I was knocked off center. And it was pretty scary. But I noticed something else at the same time. I was in a sort of sacred space. Because I was actually open to do what God might have me do. I could not respond to the situation based on ridding myself of guilt. There was nothing I could do to feel better. No result I could aim for so I could move on with my life. And I felt called to say, okay God, what should I do? And I felt like I should just start seeing Nia as a person. As a beloved human being formed by God. Then I felt called to encourage her while she was pregnant, to ask her questions that I could learn from in her pregnancy. And then I celebrated with her when her daughter, Kaylin, was born a couple weeks ago. And I don't know what the future of this journey will hold with Nia and Kaylin, but I can tell you this, I'm learning more about God and I'm asking more questions about his kingdom than I was when I was settled into my comfortable seat in the middle. So if Jesus is calling us to care and concern for the poor, in part to knock us out of the center of our lives, to bring us into a sacred space that opens us up to God's will for us, why would we resist that? I mean, why would we fight so hard to stay in control? I think we all do. Some of us, we make generalizations about the poor, or we want to tell ourselves things like, all the poor people are lazy or could get a job if they tried. Some of us remind ourselves how hard we worked to get to where we are, and I'm not saying those things aren't true. I just wonder why we tend to go there first. I mean, are we really trying to remain open to what God has for us? Or are we just looking to be as comfortable as we can in our lives? Well, I can think of about a hundred reasons why I fight to stay in the middle. Here's a couple. All my life, I've received value and worth by getting concrete and measurable results. So if I can determine the agenda of a situation, I can ensure that I'll be rewarded if I succeed. We live in a culture that's success versus failure. So we come to a situation with the poor and we have to decide ahead of time what are we trying to accomplish? If a person's homeless, they need a home. If they're jobless, they need a job. If they don't have the skills it takes to make it in this world, we need to make them as much like the middle class American as we can. I need to get credit for my success. I need to be validated. And success can't be measured by how much I'm formed or how much I learn or grow. It can't be measured by how much more patient or kind I become or how much a person understands their sense of self after being in relationship with me. If I take this approach, how am I going to get value in this society? I need to know. Did they get a job? Did she get a house? Because if not, this was a waste of my time. I'm not saying we don't work for jobs for the jobless or homes for the homeless. But I imagine that it's hard to be present to a relationship and to be open to what God's calling us to when we have to decide the measurable outcome of our success before we enter into a relationship. A friend shared a fear of hers with me around this idea. She said, what if I become like the poor? Or worse, what if I end up liking them? I just want to ask you what fears stir in you around this. What things do you sense that make you resistant towards getting thrown out of the center of your life? I think for some of us, myself included we're scared to death God is going to make us do something we don't want to do I mean we want to know our life is okay I want to know that I have everything as a gift from God so I remain at the center of a situation where I can control outcomes never mind that I'm still at the center of my life because when I do a good deed I want to know God is smiling down on me that he's happy with me I don't want to sit around and ask questions about the two cars in my garage. And my point here is not to condemn wealth and material things. That's not what this is about at all. My point is that maybe we fight so hard to stay in control of our lives and we use care for the poor, one of the main ways God intended to knock us out of the center to get more comfortable there. Maybe Jesus wants us to be just a little bit uncomfortable, to have discussions about some of the hard scriptures and ask hard questions about the world around us and how we can respond to it. At the end, I think grace will await us. I mean, grace has to await us all. But I fear that we're so scared about what God is going to make us do. We're fighting tooth and nail to stay in control. And because of that, we're missing a sacred space that we're being invited into, and we're missing the calling on our lives. So why would we avoid relationship with the poor? Maybe because once we enter into an authentic relationship with any type of poverty. We find ourselves with less safety and less security and more things to wonder about that are going to make us uncomfortable. I think this list goes on. I think there's tons of other fears we could talk about here. But I think we have to ask, we all have these fears. So where does that leave us? I mean, why should we really try to enter into this and push past this? And I'll tell you, not only do I think that we're pretty miserable at the center and that we're making each other miserable as well, but I really think this is where the true life is. If we can move out of the center long enough to get some sacred space, I think we might discover this is one of the most important journeys we can take with the rabbi because when I'm out of the center, when I'm done pursuing building my own empire and preserving my way of life, I might actually be open to God's call on my life because maybe when I let go of that merry-go-round bar, I'm in the best place to be used in the redemption and restoration of this world. So here's my last question today. How do we intentionally enter into this? I mean, some of us are pretty miserable at the center of our lives. We're really tired of holding on. So we'd love to know, how do we get knocked out of the center? And there's this major theme that keeps coming up in regards to care for the poor. And I think it's obvious, it's relationship. A lot of people have told me stories around here about times they've come into contact with people and they've made friends with them first and then found out they were poor in one way or the other. But because they got to know the person as a friend first, they made a relationship connection. Instead of just seeing the person as an issue to be dealt with, they saw the person as their friend. They didn't have an agenda. They just wanted to know more of the person's story and figure out where God was calling them to act in that situation. I recently read a book that said that Jesus did not leave behind a painting or a book or plans for a great temple, but Jesus left behind a series of relationships. And I think a lot of those relationships were with the marginalized in his midst. There's a gentleman named Shane Claiborne who wrote a book called Irresistible Revolution. And in it he says this, it's a beautiful thing when folks in poverty are no longer just a missions project, but when they become genuine friends with whom we laugh, cry, dream, and struggle. Servanthood is where we begin, but we move towards mutual love and genuine relationship. That's when things get messy. When people move beyond charity and towards justice and solidarity with the poor, as Jesus did, they get into trouble. Once we're actually friends with folks in struggle, we start to ask why people are poor, and that's not as popular as giving to charity. People do not get crucified for giving to charity. People get crucified for living out a love that disrupts the social order and calls forth a new world. Mother Teresa, who honestly seems to get this better than anyone in history, said this, I have come to see that the great tragedy in the church is not that rich Christians don't care about the poor, it's that they don't know the poor. When the worlds of poverty and wealth collide, the resulting powerful fusion could change the world, but that collision rarely happens. I long for the Calcutta slums to meet the Chicago suburbs, for the lepers to meet the landowner, and for each to see God's image in each other. It's no wonder that the footsteps of Jesus led from the tax collectors to the lepers, because I truly believe that when the poor meet the rich, riches will have no meaning, and when the rich meet the poor, we'll see poverty come to an end. If we approach people in a way that says, I want to know who you are, I want to see more of your belovedness. I want to hear your story. We might actually have a chance of falling in love with him in a way that would throw us off center. But if we approach people with judgment and an agenda, with a I know what you need to do attitude, with a I have a protective wall up because I don't want you to ruin my life, I don't think we'll ever really understand what Jesus calls us to in terms of care for the poor. So instead of remaining trapped in an endless cycle of self-preservation, accumulating wealth, and being afraid that someone's going to come and take what we have away from us, let's look for ways to be in relationship with people in poverty, people who are marginalized, people who are overlooked. Let's look for ways to get knocked out of the center, and let's confront each other when our fears keep us from doing that. And then, let's share in the experience as the reality of God's kingdom becomes clear to us in whole new ways, and we start living as a transformed people in a way that could bring justice and healing to the world in a radical way. I think if I asked the question, how many of us are currently in relationship with someone who's in poverty, most of us would answer, yes, we are. A lot of you are experiencing this, and I feel overwhelmed by people who tell me stories of people they come into contact with. Most of the time, it has nothing to do with Open Door or our programs or our efforts. It has to do with them noticing where their lives intersect with people in poverty every day. But I would ask us this, how many of us are actively seeking that out? How many of us are doing that on purpose? I think the starting point is to ask ourselves what situations we can put ourselves in that will knock us off center. I mean, there are probably hundreds of people in situations you encounter every day that could give you this opportunity. Like what if the next time you and your family watch the news, you prayed for people you would usually judge? What if this next week you found one person that you know is poor in one way or the other and you had a conversation with them that lasted longer than 10 minutes? What if the next time a panhandler asks you for money, you just ask them their name? You know, with my neighbor Nia, there might be some things I can do. Maybe we will buy her something. Maybe I will throw a shower for her. I don't know. Or maybe I'll just keep asking God and it'll be enough to just deepen my friendship with her. As we wonder what this means in our personal lives, let's also wonder what this means for our community. I mean, I don't think we quit collecting coats and school supplies and money and food and shoeboxes. In fact, I think if we enter into this invitation of the rabbi, those things are going to grow. They're going to double and triple and quadruple. Because we're going to be doing this because we're compelled by relationship, not by obligation. We know that Jesus' desire is more than a disconnected charitable approach for us. And at the end of the day, it's not going to be about how many coats that we collected or how many hours we tutored. It's going to be about how we journeyed with the poor around us and if we were formed in the process. And I can only dream about what might happen if we continue to take ourselves out of the center in intentional ways and enter into this sacred space. because as we move into relationship with people, I can guarantee we're gonna start talking about the poor differently, we're gonna start looking at the poor differently, and we're gonna start looking at ourselves differently. Maybe through this, we'll actually understand more of God's kingdom and the poverty he desires in each of us. Maybe this kind of care for the poor literally has the potential to change our entire life, to get us out of the miserable predicament of self-preservation, of grasping for whatever we can get our hands on. Maybe in our relationship with the poor, in our fight for justice on their behalf, we could find a kind of freedom and fulfillment that we only dream of now. And I know that journeying down this road will give us more questions than answers, maybe more turmoil than happiness at times. But I think it's a journey we have to be on as families, as individuals, and as a community. Because if we allow ourselves to get knocked out of the center and we find ourselves totally inadequate and without the answers, We just might be available to enter into what God's calling us to. And I really believe this can happen. That's why I'm so excited to be on this journey. I'm so excited to be on staff here. Are we going to know when we're done? No. Are there going to be clear and measurable benchmarks along the way to tell us how our progress is going? Probably not. But I do believe that we'll begin to change into a church that's not marked merely by charitable acts, but by people who are in real relationships with the poor, who care about the poor and are committed to act on their behalf. And when we look at Church of the Open Door, we won't just see a large group of really charitable people doing really generous things. We'll actually see a community that's knocked off center, that's asking hard questions, not sure quite what we're doing, but that's dedicated to care for the least and the lost and the marginalized and the sick and the overlooked in ways that just might change the world. So let's seek to be a community of this true charity, one that follows the rabbi into those sacred spaces where we're knocked out of the center and we can more fully understand what God's calling us to in terms of his desire to redeem and restore the world. I just want to pray as we close. God, it's the desire of our heart to follow the rabbi. Lord, and to learn from the example he set for us in terms of care for the poor. And as we seek out that invitation, help us to remain open. Open our eyes and our ears and our hearts and our minds to ways we can do this every day right now. Lord, and give us the grace to confront each other and to celebrate with each other. As we look to further our understanding of how you want to redeem and restore the world through each of us. Amen. Peace as you go. Thank you. Thank you.
