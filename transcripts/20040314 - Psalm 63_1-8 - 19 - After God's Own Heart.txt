Good morning. How are you doing? You're probably doing better than I am right now. I'm going to fill in for Dave today. My name is Al Shuck. I am the pastor of Youth Ministries here at Open Door. I get the privilege of mine to work with our teenagers, absolutely incredible young people, a wonderful staff, and a bunch of terrific lay people. I spend about 90% of my time doing that. And most of you know by now that the other 10% of my time is spent mentoring Pastor Dave. Seven years ago, when our executive pastor, Keith Meyer, came to me and asked me to take on this enormous task, I really have been feeling like things have been going well. And then last week happened. yeah when pastor dave uh uh decided to bring about the new look um i realized that we had entered the shock and awe part of the mentoring process uh i had been told this would come this was this is that time when the when i begin to wonder if all my time has been wasted uh the experts told me this was going to happen, but nothing quite prepared me for that. But I'm here to tell you that I will not give up. He made it too easy. I mean, you do that the week before the youth guy talks. I mean, he's like, hello. But anyway, we have been in a series for a while now called The Journey of the Heart. And we've been using the life of the Old Testament hero, David, to take that journey. And I want us to continue that journey today, but I want us to pray before we start. Jesus, be the center. Be the one that we come around this morning. The one that we fix our attention on. Lord, we want you to capture our hearts, to capture our minds. Jesus, be the center. We love you, and we just give you this time in your name. Amen. There are a lot of big people in the Bible, a lot of big names. You've got at the very beginning, you've got Adam and Eve, and then you've got Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses, and Esther, and Jonah, and then you've got Mary, and Peter, and John. A lot of big names. We've been looking at David. And there's a phrase that is said about David in the Bible that I've always liked. It's always kind of just grabbed me. And part of it is because of who says it, because it's God who says it. And the word actually says this. God says this. I have found David, son of Jesse, a man after my own heart. He will do everything I want him to do. A man after God's own heart. Wow. I'll take that title. If God chooses to show up here and say that about me, I'll gladly accept that title. I will sleep well knowing that he said that about me. Picture yourself. Put yourself in David. What would it be like for God to say that about you? For God to say, I have found, put your name in there. He is a man after my own heart. I have found, put your name in there. She is a woman after my own heart. He is a boy. She is a girl after my own heart. I'd take that. And I think you probably would too. I love that phrase. And God said that about David, that David had a heart that was after his heart, that passionately pursued his heart, that wanted to grab and take hold of and hold on to God's heart. I would love for him to say that about me. And I bet you would too. A man after God's own heart. to have God look you in the eye and say, I know you. And I know your heart. And I know you want my heart. And I know you'll do everything I want you to do. I love that phrase. Since I was a little kid, I love it. I don't know, just grab me. But that phrase has also given me some trouble, quite honestly. It's caused some problems. And in order for me to explain that, I need to tell you a couple stories, and I need to take you to one of the most amazing places in the whole world. We've got to go on a little trip. This place is absolutely spectacular. Some of you have been there. I am talking today about the Grand Canyon. Huh? How many of you have been there? Been there? Grand Canyon. It's amazing. This place is spectacular. It's one of the most beautiful places on earth. This place, oops, oops. That's not supposed to be there. You can keep going. Sorry about that, folks. Somehow my picture of my daughter got in there. I don't know how that happened. Sorry about that. That was supposed to be cleared up. But anyway, all right, sorry. Grand Canyon, all right? The Grand Canyon, it's amazing. This place is beautiful. You could adventure for days, weeks, months, and not begin to scratch the surface of all that's there. I can't believe this place if you don't know where it's at it is located in the northwest corner of Arizona it covers believe it or not it covers over a million acres of land over 1900 square miles at its deepest it's 6,000 vertical feet from the rim to the bottom it's one of the seven natural wonders of the world and over 4 million people every year visit the Grand Canyon words that come to mind when you see the Grand Canyon are spectacular, majestic, enormous, beautiful, breathtaking. That's the Grand Canyon. You can take a donkey ride. You can take a donkey ride like down in there and you're looking over the edge and it's like you're going to fall. It's amazing. You can adventure for days, never scratch the surface. The sheer magnitude will literally take your breath away. But I got to tell you one more thing about the Grand Canyon. I've never been there I've never been there I've never stood there and looked at that grand display of glory I've never ventured to the bottom of the Grand Canyon These eyes right here never have even caught a glimpse of the Grand Canyon It's never taken my breath away You know for far too long in my life. That's how it's been with God too. I know a lot about God. He's the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning, the end. He's huge. He's enormous. You could search God for days, weeks, months and not begin to scratch the surface. Words that come to mind are majestic and spectacular. He's amazing, breathtaking. It's just unbelievable. But he's never taken my breath away. what's that about you see the reason I know so much about God in some ways is because of the same reasons I know so much about the Grand Canyon I've heard people talk about it I've seen their pictures I've heard their stories but have I experienced it you know I can shake my head look at the pictures beautiful you have beautiful pictures there that's beautiful pictures beautiful but deep down if I'm going I've never been there that's a problem well I need you to stick with me here I'm going to share with you two things that I think were a primary reason why it was difficult why this phrase a man after God's own heart is difficult because if I don't experience it but I just know about it that's a problem and there's two reasons I think and I'm speaking from my life and maybe you can relate I'm hearing that a lot of people might be able to relate to this first one is this As I was growing up, my idea of how God related with me and interacted with me was kind of like this. I would have long periods of kind of nothing. And then if I could get to, like I'd go to summer camp or I'd go on a retreat or I'd go to a conference and I'd feel something finally. There'd be like this emotional feeling that I have and I'd get like a real connection with God. usually it had to do with confessing my sin. I was called to come to the altar or come to the fire. He would be at the fire. But somehow or another, I would have this emotional experience, and I would commit myself because I didn't want to sin anymore, and I didn't want this feeling to leave, so I'd say, I'm going to read my Bible and pray every day, and I'd make this commitment, and that lasted. It seemed to last about as long as it took for me to get the sleeping bag out of the trunk when I got home. and when you do that over and over and over and over again subtly what I came to think was you know what, that's how you meet with God but in my everyday, ordinary life as I go through just doing the thing of being Al and showing up and going to school or going to my job or just doing life, God doesn't meet you there so the best you can hope for is to the next thing that's coming and like sin or change in my life I mean the best you can kind of hope for is kind of white knuckle it for a while and try really hard not to do a certain behavior but to actually change to become a different kind of person that's about character that's about your heart that's about desires and changing of desires that was I didn't actually experience that So in my mind, the campfires, the altars, it didn't make any real difference in my life. And so I began to believe some things about how God interacts. I didn't expect a whole lot. And there's another thing that played a part in this, and it has to do with this book that we call the Bible. I grew up at a place where there was a huge priority put on knowing the Word of God. that's a good thing but where it fell short for me was we never went from knowing the word of God to experiencing the life of God and that was just me personally I can't say it was for everybody but for me I didn't make that jump from knowing the word of God to experiencing the life of God it didn't happen and so in a way I wasn't much different than the prince of Granada some of you might know the story of the prince of Granada he was sentenced to prison in Madrid, Spain, in what they called the Place of Skulls because they were afraid that he was going to aspire to the throne. So they took the prince and they threw him in prison. And when they threw him in prison, they gave him one book to read, the Bible. Apparently, the prince read this book several times, cover to cover. Because when he died, written on the cells of his prison, written in the stone, scratched with a nail, were phrases, hundreds of phrases such as this. The eighth verse of the 97th Psalm is the middle verse of the Bible. Ezra, 721, contains all the letters of the alphabet except the letter J. The ninth verse of the eighth chapter of Esther is the longest. No word or name of more than six syllables can be found in the Bible. Here was a guy who apparently knew the word of God better than anybody, but there was no evidence that he had ever experienced the life of God or encountered the living God. No evidence whatsoever. You see, the goal, the goal is for this book to lead us to a person. The goal is for this book to lead us to a real, live, living God. But since knowing the word of God didn't lead to experiencing the life of God, quite honestly, this book became intimidating. This book became kind of scary. It became kind of like, I don't get it. So it became a textbook to me, quite honestly. And the thing is this. God didn't give us the Bible as a textbook to study. I know we study it. There's nothing wrong with studying it. But that's not the primary reason. These scriptures are given to you to draw you in to a life of experiencing God. These scriptures are given to call out to you and woo you into a relationship. And I miss that somehow. somehow I missed that for so long for so much of my life this book this book I felt like I needed to know every answer about this book I needed to know how to pronounce every word I needed to know how to you know like if someone had a question I needed to be able to prove it it's like I needed to be able to read this whole thing in 365 days and if I didn't it intimidated me but it never it never crossed my mind that this book is intended to lead you and I to the one who our souls cannot live without. This book contains the life of God. It contains the truth that is our freedom. But I missed that somehow, real subtly. And so this book became kind of scary. And you know what happens when it becomes kind of scary or becomes kind of, makes no, see, I'm supposed to, not only was I supposed to do all that stuff, but I was supposed to be excited about it. I was supposed to be enthused about it, even though it didn't make any difference in how I really lived my life. It doesn't work. And so real subtly what happens is, is I leave this on the end table. I leave this laying by the bed. I don't pick this up. You know, in some ways it's kind of easier to let Pastor Dave do it. You know? I mean, he kind of knows how to do this. I don't get it. He knows how to take something. He makes it sound just what I need. We are blessed, folks. We are blessed to have the pastor we have that can do that. But if that's what we're going on, if that's all you and I have to live off of, we're missing out on so much. Because this book is personal. And it's for you and it's for me. It's a personal book. But I missed out on that. I had a messed up idea about change and how God would change me, and it felt like it was just at these mountaintop times, not in my everyday life. And I had a messed up idea about the book, and it never led me to the person. But I've come to know a couple things. And the first one is this. First of all, a real relationship with God is the goal, and it's possible. But like any relationship, it takes time and effort. Not effort to gain his love, but effort to know him. And you know what? There isn't a married person in this room that won't tell you that feelings come and feelings go. It's not about the feelings. It's a constant, continual turning to God. It starts when you get up in the morning. It goes all throughout your day. And it's when you go to bed at night. It's this continual giving your attention to God. Fixing your eyes. turning your heart. It's continual, moment by moment, day by day. I make a choice right from the start to center myself in him, to make my home in his love and his grace and to live there. That's a challenge, but it's an adventure. Each day will carry with it all kinds of challenges and problems, but we choose right from the start start to center ourselves in him. I need to throw away my timetable of how God changes or when God's going to change or that kind of, you know. I don't know about you, but for me personally, I think most of the time I overestimate how much I'm going to change in a week. You know, I go to something, I get this feeling, I go, yes, I commit myself and I'm going to change. And I leave there feeling like I'm going to, I'm never going to be the same again, you know. and I overestimate that. But you know what else I'd do? I think I underestimate how much God could change me in a year. A year of continually, moment by moment, day by day, turning to him and seeking his face. I think the change that he could do in us in that year would become different kind of people. Because I focus on the short term, I give up quickly. Real change is possible. The other thing that I mentioned, again, was back to this book. And what is the primary role of the Bible? We're in the life of David. We're looking at the heart of David. Why is the story of David in here? Why is the life of David in this book? Is it so you and I can study it and know everything about it and see that David was a person after God's own heart? No. No. This book is calling you and I to be people after God's own heart. The stories are there. The stories are there just to whet our appetite, just to get us a little hungry, just to get us wanting to go in that direction. I got this idea that David, if he was sitting down in the front row, he'd probably come up here, walk up here, because I've been talking for a while now, come up here and he'd ask me for the microphone. And I think what David would say is, he'd probably say this, you know what, enough already. I mean, I'm glad you look at my life. I'm glad you study my life. I'm glad you read the Bible. I'm glad you memorize it. But don't just look at my pictures. You've got to take the trip. you gotta journey to the bottom of the canyon yourself don't just look at my pictures experience it for yourself partake in it open yourself wide open to it it's available to you the kingdom of God is here he's available to you and to me as we continue to turn back to him but don't take his word for it I think David would say to us don't take my word for it you gotta experience it yourself quit talking about my life go ahead live the life live the adventure it's available to you you might be saying would David would David really say that would he actually say it I think he already has I think he already has in Psalms 34 David says to us taste and see that the Lord is good that's his way of saying don't look at the pictures you gotta take the trip that's David's taste and see quit looking at the menu start digging into the food enjoy it he's good and he's available to you and to me taste and see I think David if he was standing here I think he would look at you because he's one of us boy if you want someone who's real he's one of us it's just that he has consistently turns back to God. He's one of us. I think David, if he's standing here, not me, but David, if David was here, I think he would say this, oh sure, there will be times when you don't feel a thing, and God feels like he's a million miles away, and you may find yourself saying what I say, how long, oh Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? And David would say, you know what, there's going to be times in your life, many times, when you're going to stumble and fall, and you're going to be so embarrassed, but maybe you will run and cry out to him the way I do, and you'll say, have mercy on me, oh God, have mercy on me, for in you my soul takes refuge. And sometimes David would say, you know what, sometimes it's going to take a while. Sometimes it takes a while. It's consistent, persistent turning. But if you keep showing up, you will find, you will come to find, as I have come to find, that the Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love. But don't take my word for it. Don't just look at my pictures. You gotta take the trip. You gotta go there yourself. I think David would say as you continually turn to him you will experience so much more there will be times when you experience his protection to the extent that you can say what I say you are my hiding place you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance there will be times David would say to you and David would say to us this morning there will be times when you just don't think you've got it in you anymore. You just can't do it. You're ready to give up. You're at the end of your rope and you're starting to say, I can't do it. And I think David would say, you may want to consider crying out to God the way I cried out to God. And I said, from the ends of the earth, I call to you. I call as my heart grows faint. Lead me, God, to the rock that is higher than I because I can't do it myself. and I think finally I think David would say you know what when you do that he will respond you might not hear it right away but you consistently he'll respond and you know what your pain might not go away he might not even change your situation but you might find what I've found that just hearing his whisper of be still and know that I am God, that that's enough for you, that that's enough. But don't just look at his pictures. You got to go on the trip. You got to go there yourself. I've been trying to take my own pictures. I've been trying to go there and take my own pictures. And sometimes it just happens in such strange ways that you weren't even planning. And for me, it started by I was reading a book. And I'm not going to share with you the name of the book or who wrote it because you don't ever get out pens and papers and write it down like when Pastor Dave does. So I'm going to deal with that. This book was written by a man who comes to the end of his life, and he has cancer. And the first chapter, he wrote the book as kind of his journals. Then chapter one is him saying goodbye to his friends and family. And in the face of cancer, he says some amazing things all throughout the book. And what I came to realize was that he started something years ago that then changed him. And what it was was this. He says, most mornings of my life I get up early and put myself in his presence. Once at home with the Lord, I always start my day with the Ignatius little prayer. Take, Lord, and receive all I am and have. You've given it all to me. I give it all back to you. Do with me as you want. Just give me your love and your grace, and that's enough. Every morning, he started that prayer for years. That's how he started his day. That was his continually turning back. At the end of his life, he's facing cancer. And it was amazing to see the way he could face that. And what I realized was that little turning back day by day, Every day, turning back, that's what did it. He became that. Well, in one of those times you can't explain, as I read this for the first time, what popped into my head right away was, what's my prayer? What's my prayer? And I was like, God, what am I gonna say to you every morning I wake up? What's gonna be my prayer? Well, I started thinking, if it's gonna be something you're gonna do every day, probably better be good. I probably better make sure it's really profound. I better make sure it's really, you know, I mean, I'm going to do this every day. I mean, this isn't like, okay. And so I tried really hard to come up with this perfect prayer, and I got so frustrated. I was trying. I couldn't do it. And then I'd try again. I was trying really hard, but it wasn't, it's a relationship. In September, the senior staff went out to King's House out in Buffalo for a retreat, and we had some time where we could just go be alone. I was sitting in a chapel, and don't know how else to explain it, But I knew what the prayer was. I knew it. I just knew it. I couldn't explain. I quick grabbed a piece of paper and a pen, and I knew that's the prayer. That's my heart and his heart connected, and that's my prayer. And I began to pray that every morning. I began to pray it throughout the day. I wasn't expecting to do that, and I began to pray it at night. It just kind of happened. Well, here's the deal. I'm not going to tell you the specifics of that prayer, because quite honestly, when it is a relationship, there are things between you and another person when it's intimate that it becomes so precious and valuable that you don't want to share it with just anybody. But I'm gonna share with you one phrase. And it came to be a very important phrase to me because in October, and we're only talking two months, in a two-month period of time, of me consistently turning back to God with a simple prayer. I was driving my Jeep. I drive a Jeep Wrangler, which everyone tells me is one of the least safest vehicles in the world. and I just love it. It's just like, you know, it's just an amazing deal. And I was driving out here on Highway 94, heading from here, church home, and as I was going along, I was passing a semi and so I was in the left-hand lane and it was drizzly rain and before I could even think, the semi cab was in my lane. It had jackknifed and it was pushing me into the ditch. And if you've been in that kind of a thing, I'd heard, you know, that, well, it's, everything will slow down to slow motion. It did. I mean, it was incredible. I mean, I thought that was like 15 minutes, you know. I had time to think about stuff. I mean, it was crazy. And you got to understand something. When I was two years old, just before I turned two, my mom and I were in a car accident, and my mom was killed. And for years, there has been this fear thing around death. And as this was happening, I totally was able to picture my wife and my daughter. The thoughts that went through my head were, you're in a Jeep. It's going to roll. And it did. You're going to die. I thought this is it. My daughter right now is the same age as I was when my mom was killed. This stuff keeps me awake at night. This stuff sends chills down my spine. Because now I'm facing, this is what I thought it's happening. Back to my prayer of turning to God. One of the phrases that just came out that day, One of the phrases in that prayer was, God, I give you my fears. And I've been saying that. And I stand here right now honestly telling you that in the middle of that and thinking that I was going to probably die, there was an incredible peace. There was a sense of it's okay. You're okay. They'll be okay. It's okay. Is it possible that just a simple prayer of turning back to God, day after day, fixing your attention, could do that deep down? I believe it. It happened. It happened to me. You see, here's the deal. There's a big difference between reading in the 23rd Psalm that though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. And walking through your own personal valley of the shadow of death and being able to look back and say, I walked through it and I feared no evil because you were with me. He was there, very present. There's a big difference there. You see, now we're getting personal. Now it's becoming real. Now it's becoming a relationship. Now it's becoming something that takes my breath away. I'm starting to take the trip. I'm not just looking at the pictures anymore. The life of David's an invitation. It's one thing for you and for me to read in the Psalms that for God, or for David, God was the lifter of his head. You've heard that phrase? He was the lifter, or he's the lifter of my head. It's a completely different deal. you turn to him continually and in those times when your head is hanging in shame and disgrace and you're so ashamed of what's going on in your life and he comes to you and with one hand on your shoulder he takes his other hand and he puts it under your chin and he gently lifts your head until you and him are eye to eye that's a whole different deal and when he says to you when you're eye to eye the tears he's wiping the tears and he says to you what he said to David you are my child today I am your father see you gotta take the trip it's a real different deal it's one thing for you and I to see that David was after God's heart. But it's a whole other deal to continually turn back to God with or without feelings until you can say, coming pouring out of you, what came pouring out of David throughout his life, show me your ways, oh God. Teach me your paths. Guide me in your truth and teach me. For you are God my savior and my hope is in you all day long. I want that to come out of my heart out of an experience God you know it's like my hope is that day after day after day I would turn to you so that I can say as David said your love is ever before me and I walk continually in your truth wouldn't that be awesome wouldn't that be awesome the life of David's an invitation to you and to me it's not about studying someone who's after God's heart it's about being someone who's after God's heart we study it so that it leads us there you are going to have to find your special way of connecting with God that prayer thing, it came through a book I don't know, that's what makes a relationship so exciting and there are things that only you and him should know about in your relationship. I think it's wonderful. It's an intimacy thing. Maybe your thing is music. Maybe it is a prayer that you say every day that centers you back and brings you back and throughout your day. Maybe your thing is nature. Maybe your thing is writing or journaling or drawing or I don't know what it is. That's the adventure for you. Maybe it's serving or meditating or I don't know but if you continually turn back to him, he will meet you. And you know, here's the deal. he will take your breath away now you heard one story about this prayer in kind of this he saved your life type of thing which feels like a miracle I've met with God through this prayer in so many times but it's not in the miraculous but it still takes my breath away and here's why it's meeting with him in those times where you realize that you are in the presence of the Holy One. You are standing in the presence of God Almighty. And he's inviting you to come. That'll take your breath away. It's not always the big miracle stuff. It's in your everyday life. It's what you see and the things around you and the people around you and that constant turning of experiencing him. he invites you and me to come near you know what read the Psalms read the Psalms then write your own Psalms the Bible's full of wonderful wonderful poetry inside of you some of you have poetry in you that needs to be written about God the Bible's full of awesome stories you gotta write some stories The authors of the scripture paint beautiful pictures. Inside of you are some beautiful pictures that need to be painted. And you know what? We need your pictures. And we need your poetry. And we need your stories. Because when I look at your pictures, it makes me want to go there. It makes me go, I want to taste that. I want to experience that. So, you know, don't hold back. We need everyone in this. Many of the psalms are worship songs. I bet you there's worship songs in you that need to come out. The book of Acts. The book of Acts is the story of the early church. Did it end there? It didn't end there. What's gonna be our story? We're writing stories right now as a church. We're in the middle of writing stories. what story will God tell about us what story will he tell through us to other people that years from now people are still going to be talking about our stories you see we need to study the book of Acts but then we need to write our own book I'm not talking about adding the scripture don't freak out or anything I'm talking about we don't just need We as a church, we don't want to just study history. We want to make history. We don't just want to read about this ridiculously radical love that God has. We want to experience that ridiculously radical love. We don't want to just read, you know, love your neighbor. We want to love our neighbor. It's an invitation. Now, I'm not telling this body anything it doesn't already know, but I may be drawing attention to the importance of it. We've been talking about being David's generous heart, but we haven't just been talking about David's generous heart. We've been saying we want a generous heart, and we've been experiencing a generous heart. So we're doing it. The Bible is full of stories about God changing people. And you know what? God can change you too. The Bible is full of people hearing the voice of God. You know what? He still speaks. And you can hear the voice of God. It may not happen in your timing or just the way you want it, but are you willing to continually turn back and put your focus on him, give him your attention? Ask him to give you ears to hear. If you're sitting here and you go, I don't even have a desire to what you're talking about. It's like there's nothing even alive in there. Be honest about that. I have prayed over and over, God, I don't even know if I want you, but I want to want you. I know someone famous said that once, so that's why I started praying. But it's true. I don't know sometimes whether I want him, but I know that I want to want him. And when I show up and I'm honest with him about that, he meets with you. He meets with you. But remember that you're on a long journey. It's a lifelong journey. We get to do it together. We aren't just going to read about the church. We're going to be the church. That's the invitation and the vision for us. Not to look at someone else's pictures, but to take the trip ourselves. And for far too long, I've looked at other people's pictures. And I'm wanting to take my own pictures. And our invitation is for you as well. They're awesome stories, but your life is a story. And the next chapter is yet to be written. And God wants to meet you in that page. A little different approach to a man after God's own heart. It's not about studying David. it's about being a person who's after God's own heart and that's the invitation that's available to us Matt's gonna come and he's gonna play a song and I would invite you to do what we've been talking about to open yourself wide open to what God might have for you to meet him, to turn to him and the song he's gonna say it's a prayer but make it your prayer and when Matt's done you're welcome to stay and I believe there'll be altar team here as well so Jesus be the center Be my source Be my life Jesus Jesus Be the center Be my hope, Lord, and be my song, Jesus Be the fire in my heart Be the wind in my sins Be the reason that I live Jesus, Jesus Jesus Be my vision Be my power Be my God Jesus Be the fire In my heart Be the wind In my sails Be the reason that I live Jesus, Jesus Jesus Be the center Be my source Be my light Jesus Jesus Be the center Be my hope, Lord, and be my son, Jesus You're welcome to stay as long as you like. The rest of you are dismissed. Please be mindful of the people that are staying as you leave. Have a wonderful day. you
