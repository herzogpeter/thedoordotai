We are returning today to our study in this particular passage, in this section of what is called the Olivet Discourse. The Olivet Discourse is, as you know, a discourse that covers chapters 24 and 25, and in it Jesus is revealing to the disciples and to us the events that are going to be surrounding His Second Coming. The setting for this discourse is Wednesday of the Passion Week. In just a matter of hours, actually, he is going to be going to trial and ultimately then move on to his execution. So to that, we bring a certain degree of tension with us as we study this. The discourse was set into motion by a question that was posed to Jesus by the apostles in verse 3. The question, as most of you know, had two basic parts. The first part of the question was this. What will be the sign of your parousia or your full presence? What will be the sign of your coming kingdom? What will be the sign of the end of the age? The second part of the question was this, and when will these things happen? When will these things be? From verse 4 to 31, which is what we've covered thus far in our study, Jesus has been dealing with and revealing to the disciples what the signs of his parousia would be. In verse 4 to 14, the signs that he gave to them were general signs, signs that would indeed mark every age. In verse 6 of chapter 24, it says, you're going to hear wars and rumors of wars in every generation and every age. Don't get excited about that. Don't be frightened about that because these things must take place, but that is not yet the end. Verse 8, these are simply the beginnings of birth pains. But moving past general signs that are going to mark every age, all of them do speak to the coming of the king. But past the general signs, there is a specific sign that he then gave in verse 15, the abomination of desolation. And several weeks ago, we went into great detail about what that event was, as it was spoken of in Daniel, and when we believe that is going to take place at a future time. And this abomination of desolation is going to enter into or usher in the final three and a half years of man's day or man's history upon the earth. And the instruction by Jesus to the disciples, and again now to us, and ultimately to the final generation that happens to be there when this happens, is when you see this particular event, this very specific sign, the instruction is to run, flee to the mountains. The reason you need to flee, verse 21, is because there will then be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall. And then he gave a third sign of the end of the age or his parousia, and that third sign came in verse 29. Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be dark and the moon will not give its light and the stars will fall from the sky. The powers of the heavens will be shaken, but things, even though the sun will be gone, things will not be dark because the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky and he will light the world. The tribes of the world will mourn because for them this means judgment, but the elect will be gathered to be with Jesus forever and we will shine like the sun in the kingdom of our Father forever and ever and ever. And now as we come to verse 32, it's as if Jesus then begins to deal with the second part of this question that started the whole discourse off. The second part of the question being this, when will these things that you just spoke of be? With that in mind, let's look at the text from verse 32 to 42, a large chunk of scripture this morning. Learn the parable from the fig tree. When its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, that's the sign that you know that summer is coming. It is near. Even so, you too, when you see all these things, recognize that he is near, that summer is near. In fact, it is right at the door. The kingdom is at hand. I am about to come. Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words about this will not pass away. But of that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone. For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah. For as in those days which were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, they were marrying and giving in marriage, until that day that Noah entered the ark. And they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away, literally washed them away, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be. In fact, it's going to be like this. There shall be two men in a field. One will be taken or washed away. The other will be left. Two women will be grinding at the mill. One will be taken or washed away. The other will be left. Therefore, be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is going to come. There's three things about this section that I want to examine this morning. The first thing is we're going to examine the parable of the fig tree. What does that mean? What is that about? What does it speak to? The second thing I want to talk about is the tempering that Jesus does of the hysteria that sometimes surrounds parousia predicting. The third thing we're going to examine is the application for right now living in light of these particular truths. Let's pray as we begin. Jesus, as we come around your word once again this morning, we are stricken with the fact that while there are things here that with our minds we're going to want to understand and have clarity in terms of our thinking, we are aware again of the fact that unless your Holy Spirit move among us and empower and anoint what is being said, there is no transforming power in any of this. And so Jesus, the same work of your spirit that was moving among us during worship, during this whole time, I pray God that that same anointing, that same power would be available during this time to disclose to our minds and hearts things that are too deep for words, that you would use this to instill in us kingdom realities that will indeed in profound ways affect our living. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Point number one, the parable of the fig tree and examination of that. The first thing I want you to understand about the parable of the fig tree before we even go into the details of it is that the parable of the fig tree is a very simple thing. It is very straightforward. It is very uncomplicated. The reason I want you to know that it is straightforward, uncomplicated, and straightforward is because many people have taken this particular parable and confused it terribly. It has been used in many cases to speak allegorically of all sorts of things that in my opinion, as we just stick with the text, which is what our constant commitment is, I don't believe that the word is intending to say it all. Among one of the most common interpretations or allegorical applications of this passage is that the fig tree is Israel. Have any of you heard that? Many of you have. I certainly have. I kind of grew up on that idea. And the very exciting thing is that when it put forth its leaves, everyone discovered that the putting forth of the leaves was obviously when Israel became a state in 1948. And when statehood was granted to, or a national identity was granted to Israel in 1948, that was the leaves being put forth. And now in verse 34, where it says, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. Wonderful news. Israel has become a state. And I guarantee you that in our generation, he is going to come back. And it's very, very interesting. But there's nothing, it's not there. And many, many things like that kind of flow when we get these wonderfully conceived ideas and then find texts that will affirm them in some way. One of the things that we've done week after week and month and year after year is simply go to the text and as we do that in the context, we find out that things are far more simple than we thought. Let's come to this and do some teaching and do some learning without any hype, without any proof texting, Just examine it and hopefully rightly divide it. Let's pick it apart. Now learn the parable of the fig tree. Stop right there. The use of the fig tree for analogy was a common thing in Scripture. Most of us are aware of that. All through the Old Testament into the New Testament, Jesus himself used it quite often. The reason he would use it quite often was simply because of the fact that fig trees were everywhere. Back in Matthew 28, which for us, back in Matthew 21, rather, which for us was several months ago, In the flow of the text, it was this same very day. Tells you how long we're taking here. This happened the same day. Jesus was, in the context of cleansing the temple, remember, he saw a fig tree far off, and it was with leaf. And he came toward that fig tree, and he discovered something. He came toward it and found out that this fig tree that had leaves on it didn't have any fruit. The reason he was going toward the fig tree was because since it had leaves, he assumed that it had fruit, it had figs, and he was hungry. And that began to be a metaphor or a kingdom teaching to the disciples and a picture of the religious system of Israel at the time that had all sorts of spiritual leaves. They had all of the external performance of religious behavior, but they didn't have the fruit, the life of God, the figs, the reality of God's life in them. And that's why God, Jesus, cursed that tree. Then he went and cleansed the temple, which was the picture of that very cursing of the tree. The point is this. Fig trees were quite often used because physically they were things that the disciples and the Jews of that time would have understood. We need to get teaching on fig trees to understand what they're about. What are we supposed to learn about the fig tree? Well, what you need to learn is this, that when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is coming. When its branch becomes tender, what is that speaking of? What that's speaking of is an event that happens early in the spring. When the spring begins to move, what moves through those branches is the sap. It begins to pulse through, life pulsing through those branches. At that particular stage of growth and life, you don't see a lot, but what's happening inside this fig tree is life. And there's a swelling of the branches. You don't really see it, but the branches at that time are tender. Finally, the time you first see it is when after the pulsing of life through those branches has happened, a leaf begins to sprout. And when the leaf sprouts, you know in a picture physically of this fig tree that summer is near because the leaf happens near the end. And summer is near and everybody should rejoice. If I were to take this picture and just apply it directly to what we know he's talking about, and that is his second coming, we're aware of the fact that this picture of the leaf sprouting and then recognizing that when the leaf sprouts, summer is near, some would rejoice about summer near. Summer near meaning the Son of Man is near. The disciples and those who are redeemed would go, oh, that's wonderful, I'm going to start looking for leaves and things that would indicate to me that that is happening now because summer is near and I'm very excited because that's a time of wonder. It's a time of the fruit. It's the time of the Son of Man. Those who are unredeemed would see the summer in an entirely different way because the summer means what? It means harvest. All through the Gospel of Matthew the summer was an indicator of harvest and harvest also meant judgment. But as this relates to a physical picture, the disciples right now are going, yeah, okay, I understand that about a fig tree. The life begins to pulse, the leaves happen, and you're saying summer comes right after that. How does this apply? I'm going to tell you how it applies, verse 33. Even so, you too, when you see all these things, stop right there. The million-dollar question is this. When you see all what things? Some people would say the things that you would see is the coming of Israel to the state. and the nationalization of Israel. Oh, no. What are these things? If we're just going to stick with the text, the things he's speaking of here are these things that he has been describing since chapter 24, verse 4. These things. When you see these things, meaning the general signs in every age, moving through every generation, that's the parallel to life pulsing through the branches. At that stage, you don't see a lot. You can't even tell what all of the workings of God are in that particular generation. Some people are wanting this to be the end, but you don't really know. There is just a constant moving of life through the branches, the root is tender. And then when the leaf sprouts, it's a more visible thing. And I would take that to be speaking, if we're going to stick with the text, to that specific event in verse 15, the abomination of desolation. When you see that, when you see the increasing of the birth pangs, when you see the stellar events in the sky, these visible leaves, when you see these things, know this, summer is near, The harvest is near. The king is coming. It is near. It is right at the door. In fact, as I catch the flow of this whole thing contextually, my view is that Jesus is giving a tremendous encouragement to those people who will be there at that time when the abomination of desolation happens. What he's saying to them is this. Every generation has thought that our generation was going to be the one. When you see this particular event, when you see these particular things, I want you to know that the promise to you is that you are the generation that will be seeing all of these things come to pass. Verse 34, I kind of got ahead of myself there. Verse 34, truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. What things? All of these things being the events of verse 4 to 28 and also the coming of the king. When you see the leaf sprouts, It is your generation that will see the coming of the king. Another big question, and this is where people debate and debate and debate. The question is this, what generation is this generation? What generation is the generation that will see the leaf sprout and therefore be here when the king finally comes? One of the views on that is that it is indeed the disciples themselves, that it is not a future generation, that he is speaking specifically to the disciples. I think it's reasonable to assume that the disciples thought that, I don't know if that would bother you at all, but I think it's clear if you even read Paul that in 1 Corinthians it seems to me that he really thought it was coming in his lifetime. When you read some of his writings in 2 Corinthians it's clear to me that he didn't think that anymore. But I think the disciples probably thought it was them, just like every generation since then thought they were the generation, just like we think we're the generation. Maybe we are, maybe we aren't. There are some, however, who even after the events have transpired, and obviously the disciples were not the generation who were going to be there when Jesus came back, there are people who still hold that he was speaking to the disciples. If you continue to hold that view, subscribe to that view, one of the results of that is you say basically this, that they subscribe to the Jesus was wrong theory. He said the disciples would be there, he was wrong. And the way we'll kind of back that up with scripture is refer to verse 36, which he himself says of that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels. In fact, I don't even know. So when he spoke of this, he was wrong. How does that one feel? I don't like that one. I don't like that one. In fact, if he's wrong about this, it would set me wondering what else is he wrong about. I don't subscribe to that at all. It doesn't even fit with the context. There are others, however, who would say he was speaking to the disciples, and that Matthew 24, and this is a widely held view, and not one without merit, okay? so I don't agree with this but it's not a silly view the one I'm going to give you and that is that all of the events spoken of here in Matthew 24 are not speaking at all of the culmination they're not speaking of the the final end of the coming of the son of man he is speaking Jesus is to the disciples about the events that are going to happen in their life relative to 70 AD remember the destruction of Jerusalem and to be sure many of the events that were described in verses 4 through 28 did happen in the destruction of Jerusalem. The problem with that particular view is that while many of the events did happen in 70 AD that are described in Matthew 24, many of the events described in Matthew 24 didn't happen in 70 AD. I think it's pretty clear that the sun didn't lose its light, the moon was not darkened, the stars didn't fall from the sky, and the sign of the Son of Man didn't happen. Some say, as I've already kind of given to you, that the generation that's going to be here and where this whole thing applies is, again, to Israel. The fig tree is Israel. The leaves being sprouted is the nationalization of Israel, them becoming a nation, finding their statehood. And therefore, the generation that will be here when it all happens is us, and everybody's charting the time and trying to figure it out. My view is this. And by the way, I've set this out pretty well, I think, over the weeks. It's real okay to disagree with my view, but my view is my view. My view is this, that this generation that he's speaking of here that will not pass away until these things happen is the generation that, whatever generation it is, that will be here when these things happen. These things meaning not just the general signs, but the generation that will be here when the abomination of desolation happens, the generation that will be here when the time known by Jeremiah as Jacob's trouble, that is the great tribulation, when that happens, when the events of verse 15 to 28 happens, take courage. Summer is near. It's right at the door. And you people, you need to know that I am coming and I am coming quickly when you see these things happen. I think that is consistent with the text. Verse 35, it's as if what he's saying here is this, and I'm not kidding. This promise is secure. Heaven and earth will pass away. In fact, verse 29, I said it would pass away. The sun would be darkened, moon would lose its light, stars would fall from the sky, but my words will not pass away. Those of you who see these particular events take courage. I really am right at the door. Back off that whole thing. This whole issue for a minute, and let's do some thinking as if we're in a coffee shop just kind of rattling around some questions here. This whole issue of the fig tree and the leaves sprouting and the life pulsing through the veins and then the promise that comes underneath that that says whatever generation sees the sprouting of the leaves, that generation won't pass away until all these things are fulfilled. Does that kind of stimulate anything in you? Well, it does in me and I think it's a very natural thing. We need to say it out loud and recognize it. I think that kind of statement stimulates us trying to figure out if the leaves are sprouting now. Doesn't it make you want to do that? I wonder if there's anything right now that would indicate to us that the leaves are sprouting. And oh my, is it going to happen? And we start looking for leaves, and is it our generation? And we flock like sheep to anyone who can put the puzzle together and identify the leaves, and it's all this very wonderful stuff. I remember when I was back in college, there was a friend in my dad, a friend of mine, he was older than me, but he was all wrapped up in this stuff and i don't know about you but if you were in an evangelical church about the time that i was in college whenever that was there was really a hysteria almost about this kind of stuff everybody was all hepped up about and this guy was so convinced that the leaves were budding and he had his little charts and he had there's a leaf and here's a leaf and how could anybody doubt it that he is right at the door and isn't this exciting so exciting to him and so convinced was he that he was coming any moment he started racking up charges on his visa. I'm not kidding you. And he's going, Dave, come on, we can do this, live great. Somebody else is going to have to pay the bill. It's a great deal. True story. 13 years later, sorry, Vince. He's having to pay his bill. See, very possibly, very possibly, knowing that this kind of promise and this kind of insight into when these things will be that he reveals in verse 32, very possibly knowing, Jesus knowing, that that might be the response of many in this particular generation, everyone following up to and including the end of the age. He gives point number two, a tempering to the hysteria of parousia predicting. Listen, folks. Listen, disciples. Everything that I just said to you in verse 32 to 35 is true. But, disciples, everyone following, I did not give you that word so that you could become stargazers. I did not give you that word so that you could become sign watchers. In fact, of that day and of that hour that I am actually going to come, no one knows. Not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone. I want to do a little side teaching here that I think is important. I don't know if it troubles you. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. Maybe it's something that kind of buzzes right over. But some of you are into this kind of stuff enough to have something kind of catching your spirit. Why didn't he know? Does that bother you that Jesus didn't know? I mean, I always had this idea that Jesus was omniscient. He would have known. That kind of bugs me. A little brief teaching on the incarnation. I want you to know that Jesus in his incarnation, in his humanity, was fully God. He was fully God. John 1, verse 1 affirms that. John 1, verse 14 affirms that. Hebrews 1 verse 3 affirms that. In fact, in that place it says, Jesus is the radiance of his glory, the exact representation of his nature, and he upholds all things by the word of his power. So in his humanity, he was fully God. But the word of God also reveals in places like Philippians 2 verses 6 through 8 that in his incarnation, Jesus voluntarily set aside or restricted certain aspects of his deity. And the result of this self-imposed restriction It says that he humbled himself, made himself to be in the form of a slave. The result of that self-limiting of his own deity was this, that he lived dependently upon the Father. He lived dependently upon the Father. In fact, places like Luke 2 says this, that Jesus grew in wisdom. He grew in stature and in the favor of God and men. It says that he learned obedience through the things he suffered. He learned submission. He said things like this. I do what I see the Father doing. I do what I hear the Father telling me to do. I know what it is that the Father reveals to me. If he doesn't reveal it, I don't know it. John chapter 15, verse 15, explicitly states that Jesus' knowledge was qualified by the things that the Father revealed. There were times, you and I know, that when he was integrating or interacting with men and women, that he knew their hearts. He knew their thoughts. He knew their questions before they even answered their question because the Father revealed to him at that time what it was that they were thinking or feeling. But only what the Father revealed. Only what the Father was doing is what he did. My belief, personal belief, is that after the resurrection, Jesus resumed the full use of all of his divine attributes. It says in Matthew 28, verse 18, All authority has been given unto me in heaven and on earth, and then he gave it to the church. But all authority has been given unto me at that time, after the resurrection. In Acts chapter 1 verse 7, in the same context of Matthew chapter 28 verse 18, the disciples were asking that question they asked over and over again. Is this the time? Is your parousia now? Are you going to bring the kingdom now? And at that time, Jesus said, It is not for you to know the times and the epics which the Father has set by his own authority. In Acts chapter 1, he didn't include himself as one who didn't need to know because I think in his resurrected form, he did know at that time. A little side teaching just to kind of give you. Let's get back to the flow of the text. Of that day and of that hour, no one will know. Let me kind of get you in on some of the questions I have when I come to a passage like that, especially in the flow of the text that we've gotten so far. One of the questions that popped up in my mind was this. How could that be? Now, see, my question is this. If we've exegeted this passage correctly so far, then by the time we get to this verse where Jesus is about to come, the leaf has sprouted forth, summer is near, signs and wonders are taking place all over the place. We've gone in Revelation, we've gone through verses 4 to 18, 4 to 28, and found out about stellar events in the universe, the sun going dark, days being shortened, incredible cataclysmic things are happening. And you're telling me that with all of these bizarre things happening all over the place, nobody's going to go, huh, I wonder if something's going on here. No, that day and hour, no one will know. Well, how will that be? I mean, it seems like there will be clear indicators, visible realities that something's up. Well, let me explain. Verse 37, it's as if Jesus is saying, let me explain. For the coming of the Son of Man, to give you a point of reference, it's going to be like the days of Noah. Think back, you guys. They would have known more about the days of Noah than we would. Think back to the days of Noah. That was another cataclysm where God came in judgment and wiped people out in a pretty harsh way. This cataclysm, the second coming is going to be a cataclysm. Sun, moon, lose their light, stars fall from the sky. But there's going to be similarities in terms of how people respond. Let me explain. The first thing you're going to see in terms of a parallel between the end times and Noah's day is this. In the days of Noah, which were before the flood, there were people eating and drinking. They were marrying and giving in marriage. Stop right there. Eating and drinking has been interpreted by some as they were very sinful, eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage. It was evil. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is not sin. There's no sin involved here. Eating and drinking is fine. Go ahead. You can eat and you can drink and you can marry and you can be given in marriage. What he's speaking to here is they were just going through their normal life. All sorts of things were happening. Apocalyptic things were happening and they were just kind of going through life as normal. The attitude in Noah's day that's going to be similar to the attitude that is pervasive in the world in the end times is this. There will be an attitude of apathy and denial. Life as usual. Think about this. In Noah's day, the problem that the people had as it related to the judgment of God that was coming was not that they didn't know. The problem was that they didn't care. They did know. Genesis chapter 6 and Genesis chapter 7 says that Noah was a preacher of righteousness. First Peter says the same thing. And it says that he preached for 120 years. Now, I don't know what kind of images you've got of Noah, but again, you know, I have these Sunday school things, and they're real good, and they're very helpful, but as a child, you get these little pictures, and the picture I had was of this little eccentric old man sitting in his backyard, building a boat, and every once in a while, someone would walk by, and as they'd walk by, he'd go, oh, by the way, a flood is coming, okay, thank you, and he'd go back and build his boat, you know, his primary thing was build a boat, and every once in a while, he'd go, flood is coming and build a book what a wacko um his primary function in the world for 120 years was to be an anointed man of god who preached righteousness he preached repentance he called people to faith he called people to brokenness and he called people to that all the time that was his primary thing and he also said and if that doesn't come and if you don't respond there is going to be judgment and that's why i'm doing this in noah's day the problem of the people was that was not that they didn't know. They knew. The problem of the people was that in spite of the message, in spite of the anointed message, they didn't care at all. So shall it be when the Son of Man comes, believe it or not, with all of the events happening in the universe, with all of the evil perpetrated upon the world, it won't be that they don't know that something's coming. It'll be that they don't care. In fact, if you tie in with some of the things we've talked about over the last several weeks in Revelation, we're aware of the fact that during the tribulation, not only will there be a tremendous outpouring of evil and demonic activity and painful things, but there will be, during that same time, a tremendous outpouring of God's power and truth. Multitudes, remember, will be saved. Multitudes from every tribe and every nation will come to the reality, and preachers of righteousness will be all through the tribulation. See, it won't be in the end times that they don't know. It'll be that they don't care. In fact, 2 Corinthians 3, 2 Peter, rather, verse 3. 2 Peter, I'm going to get it right this time. 2 Peter 3, verse 3 through 7 says that in the end times, there will be scoffers. And those scoffers will come and say, Ah, you guys, where is the promise of his coming? You goofy Christians, you talk about a second coming and a parousia, and he's right at the door, and the leaves have been sprouted for since the beginning of time. All things continue just as they have ever been and will continue to do so. So don't tell me about a second coming. Where is that? Just like they did in Noah's day. And they came to Noah and says, ah, from the beginning of time, things have been the way they are. And now you tell me there's a flood. Where's the rain? By the way, you ever get anything in your spirit that says, you know, I really believe that Jesus is coming. I really do believe that. And sometimes it's real. Sometimes it's pretty distant, but do you ever get anything that just says, why is he waiting so long? Come on. How bad does it have to get? I have a neat verse for you. Right in the flow of 2 Peter 3, right after verse 7, it says verse 8. This is a word to believers. A little encouragement. Listen. But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as 1,000 years, and 1,000 years is as a day, and we get these little timetables. It's going to have to be now. Pretty soon now. It's been so long. well, hello. But then this encouragement, but you need to know that the Lord is not slack, meaning he is not slow concerning his promises as some would count slowness. It isn't about slowness or slackness, it's about patience. You see, he is patient. Why is he patient? Because he is not willing that any should perish. The time and the end times will be the same as Noah. They will hear and they will know. And I just extrapolate that to today. Whether we are in the end times or not, that truth hits me. No matter what they hear, the world, no matter how clear the preaching might be, what signs and wonders they might see, it isn't very often that the world doesn't hear it. It's very often that they don't care. Same spirit. When Jesus came, when in his incarnation, the first time he came, we're talking about the second coming. He's talking about Noah. I'm going to add the first coming of Jesus, the incarnation. The Bible says that in his first coming, the word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory. The people who were here when Jesus walked the earth heard his words. They felt his touch. They experienced his power. They saw his miracles, the signs, the wonders. The response of the people was threefold. Those who were broken and hungry in mourning and recognized they needed a need, looked at, needed, needed a redeemer, looked at Jesus and bent their knee and said, my only hope is you. But it was always the broken, the hungry, the mourning. Those who were weary and heavy laden, the ones who knew they needed rest, came. The religious people in Jesus' day, when they saw his work and heard his words, hated them. And the world ignored them. So it wasn't Noah's day. So it will be in the end day. So it is in our day. Same thing, same response all the time. Only the weary, heavy laden get the rest. Only the broken hungry morning are hungry for grace. Part of what will blind them in the end days will be the same thing that blinds them in Noah's day and the same thing that blinds people in our day and that is a lifestyle of profound wickedness. That was true in Noah's day. That's what part of what blinded them. It says in 2 Corinthians 2 Thessalonians 2 verse 7 that that's part of what will blind the eyes of men. Again this inconceivable thing that all of these things could be happening and no one would get a clue that maybe something celestial is about to happen. It says in 2 Thessalonians 2.7 that in the end times there will be this mystery of iniquity. That little phrase intrigued me, the mystery of iniquity. I thought, what is that, the name of the Antichrist or something? It sounds kind of weird. What is that? As I began to do a little study, it just began to be clear that in the end times the level of iniquity is going to be so profound that it will be worse than anything that is previously known. and if we could look ahead to it, it would be so profound and so evil that we wouldn't be able to figure it out. I'll give you a way to get into it, to enter into this right now. Watch the 10 o'clock news. As I think of myself during the week every night watching the 10 o'clock news, it happens to me maybe three times a week where I'm watching something and I'm overwhelmed with a new way that man has been inhumane to man. A new way in which someone has slaughtered people. a new way in which sin has expressed itself. And I'm not sitting there self-righteously thinking, I don't have any sin and I would never do that. But honestly, there's a measure of something inflicted on the world or the people that I really am repulsed from. And I say this, and you've said it too from time to time, how could anybody do that? And it's not self-righteous. You really wonder, how could anybody do that to another man? You know why you say that? How could anybody do it? Because it's a mystery to you. The level of iniquity that's got to be going on is beyond you. In the end times, it's going to be worse then. There will be a blinding preoccupation with sin. And in spite of all the preaching, in spite of all the signs, instead of men and women being drawn to repentance and brokenness and grace, they will be driven more deeply into their own sin. And I don't have to do a lot of work, do I, to make that a current message? That among people even today, there is among some a blinding preoccupation with sin. And even when they hear the truth, and calls of brokenness and repentance and offers of grace rather than coming repentant and broken recognizing that Jesus could cleanse them from all of their unrighteousness and give them a brand new identity. Instead of coming to that source of living water, they run more deeply into their own sin. And they keep on doing that and keep on doing that and in spite of signs that are screaming from the heavens, my return is soon, they ignore it and ignore it and ignore it until that day. Verse 39. until the flood. Interesting in verse 39, that word flood in the Greek is not, it's the word katuklisma, katuklisma. And it doesn't mean flood, it means cataclysm. And we kind of use flood because it connects very well with the whole story of Noah. But literally the word there means to wash away. They did not understand until the cataclysm came and washed them all away in judgment. And when the flood came in Noah's day, It washed them all away. The door of the ark closed and it was too late. And one day you see the sign of the Son of Man is going to come and that is the parallel. The sign of the Son of Man appearing in the sky would be the equivalent of the door of the ark closing. You follow that? Boom, it's too late. He gives an illustration of that in verse 40 and 41. They're all going to be washed away. In fact, it's going to be like this. There will be two men in the field and one will be taken away, one will be left. Two women will be grinding at the mill. one will be taken away and one will be left. These two verses, by the way, are verses that in the view that I kind of grew up with were always used to point to what they saw was the description of a pre-tribulation rapture. Before the tribulation, the church is going to be cut up and it's going to be like this. Two will be standing in the field, one will be taken in the rapture. Before the tribulation, the other one's left. Well, okay, I think we need to stop getting our theology from Larry Norman songs, because this is not saying that. This is not saying that. It's very clear, if you stick with the context and let it flow, what this is speaking of. This is speaking of the final judgment. When the sign of the Son of Man appears in the sky, it's going to be like the days of Noah. People will be denying it. The signs will be everywhere. They won't see it. The sign of the Son of Man will appear, and just as in verse 39, the flood, the cataclysm comes and washes them away, so it will be when the sign of the Son of Man comes. There will be two standing in the field. The sign of the Son of Man will come, and one will be taken. One will be washed away in judgment. The other one will be left to enjoy the kingdom. One will be washed away in judgment. The other will be left to enjoy the kingdom. To me, the exact parallel of verse 40 and 41 is found in chapter 25, verse 31. What he's doing here is the final separation of judgment. That's what 40 and 41 illustrate. But when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne and all the nations will be gathered before him. He will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right, the goats on his left. And the king will say to those on his right, Come, you who are blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. But then in verse 41, he will say to those on his left, Depart from me, you accursed ones, and they are washed away in the waters of judgment. Just like the flood, just like the sign of the Son of Man, the washing away, the taking away is of those in judgment. The point of it all. What is the application for all of this teaching for right now living? Verse 42. Therefore, because of all of this stuff, be on the alert, disciples, every generation following up to and including the end of the age, because you do not know which day your Lord is coming. Therefore, be on the alert. It's very exciting to me because I know what's coming over the next several weeks. Up through verse 51, he is going to be taking the same teaching and saying, not only do I want you to be alert, but through verse 51, he's going to say, I want you to be dependent, I want you to be ready, and I want you to be faithful. Disciples, every generation following up to and including the end of the age, I want you to live a life of alertness, readiness, dependence, and faithfulness. Why? because you do not know which day your Lord is coming. Let me give you a little insight, at least, that I think I've gotten on this thing. One of the things I've always thought, as it relates to this promise, or this call to alertness, is that the motivating aspect of this truth is that his coming might be today. And I think that's an okay thing, and I think that's an appropriate motivator. His coming might be today. therefore since you don't know if he might come today and it might be today on the way home therefore be on the alert and that's a great motivator to be alert and be ready some of your Bibles say watch therefore and just if you would just stick with the English there the English translation the tendency would be to what does it look like if I'm watching or if I'm alert as it relates to the second coming watching would be doing this because it might you don't know when he's coming so watch I think I miss the point I really do if I were to play this out and think about getting in my little car to go home this afternoon and I'm driving down highway 94 to get to my house and I'm just kind of sitting there and all of a sudden the sign of the son of man appears and I would kind of let that into my spirit right now David you need to understand that on your way home the sign of the son of man might appear in the sky and you might be caught up with him so be alert I wouldn't change a thing I'm doing in fact are you ready yeah yeah yeah, I'm ready right now. I was ready when I bent my knee to Jesus and I was washed in the blood. I became a new creature in Jesus Christ. When that sign of the Son of Man appears in the sky, that's going to be great because I'm done now. I'm done being alert. I'm done needing to be alert. I'm done being ready. I was ready and now he came and here we go. The motivator you see to me in this whole encouragement that says you don't know which day he is coming doesn't move me if you come to me and say, it could be tomorrow. You know, every once in a while, people come up to me and go, you know, I've discovered what the leaves are, and I really think they've sprouted. Here are the events in the Middle East. Can you believe that? That's what leaves of sprouted. It's going to be any day. What do you think? What do you think? What is that going to do to us, how we live? Not a thing to me. I think the thing that motivates me and moves me is to realize that I don't know when the Lord is coming back. I do not know which day he is coming. And you know what that means to me? That means that he might not come. You know what that means to me? I might have to live. And I might not be brought out this afternoon. That means that the call on my life is not to watch. My call on my life is to live the rest of my life. If I don't see the coming of the Son of Man, I need to be for the rest of my life alert, dependent, faithful, and ready. Because I might have to run the course. Disciples, I am not telling you this so you become stargazers. I do not want you stargazing. I want you living, disciples, alert, ready, dependent, and faithful. These words given originally to the disciples were given to people, were given to men who were not going to see the sign of the Son of Man. And I want you to live dependent, ready, alert, because, disciples, you may have to go the distance without ever seeing the sign of the Son of Man. And you might have to suffer, and you might have to die, so be alert to live. I hope this doesn't sound like heresy to you, but you need to know that my personal response to this passage is not getting all jazzed because it might be tomorrow. If it's tomorrow, that'd be great, then I'm done. In fact, I'm not living as if the sign of the Son of Man is going to appear this afternoon. I am not. The way I'm living, quite frankly, is assuming that I'm going to go for the long haul. And because my whole perspective on life is that I'm going to go for the long haul, and if he interrupts that, I'll be delighted. You can't even believe it. but my plan and my view is that I'm going to go for the long haul you know what that means to me that means that I'm going to need to live for the long haul and I'm going to have to live in this way alert and I'm going to have to live in this way ready and dependent and faithful unto the end with one basic focus and that is this to hang on to Jesus for dear life my whole life because I don't know when he's coming back it could be tomorrow that'd be great but it might not, and that means I need to hang on to him. Let me conclude with this. I want to speak just briefly as I close to those among us who might be unredeemed, and I'm very aware that as we are moving, even in this entire series, not just this message, but the entire series of Matthew 24 and 25, that to unredeemed ears, many of these words would land on your ears differently than they do on the ears of a redeemed person among us. I want to say this, too, that I'm aware of the fact that in our church over the last several years, more and more people have begun to come to our church who don't really know Jesus. You feel somehow comfortable here. It's kind of a neat thing. I want you to know that we're so glad you're here. I hope you keep coming. But I also want you to know that as I go through some of these apocalyptic events, it dawns on me that some of you might hear this and think this just sounds like fairy tale time. This is fable land. And if you're an unredeemed person, the word of God has no real authority in your life. You might respect it and see it as some sort of guide for life, but no real authority in your life, and if you're an unredeemed person, I wouldn't expect it to. It may be even that as you hear some of these things, speaking of then times, that you would be a scoffer. Yeah, yeah, you guys are crazy. You know, I really like you people. I hope you're a polite scoffer. Like, you know, you like us and we'll like you, and you'll scoff politely at all these things. But again, if that was your response and you're among us unredeemed, I would understand that. That's okay. and that's why as i close i want to take all of this stuff out of this context that that might for you be weird and and and take it out of this context of eternal end times cataclysm and bring this whole talk down into something that is real and concrete personal right now and today you see the fact is this and it's one that nobody can deny redeemed or unredeemed that every single one of us whether you enter into this reality of an eternal apocalypse something that this this ultimate thing that is going to happen, whether you buy that or not, the fact is that every one of us one day will experience a personal apocalypse. You will experience a personal cataclysm, your own personal flood, as it were. Your day speaks here of man's day, which is the end of the age. You're going to have your day. What I'm talking about is death. And like the dragnet described in Matthew chapter 13 verse 47 where the the drag net is moved out into the ocean and it pulls up all the fish meaning men and it throws ultimately everyone finally up onto the shores of eternity in verse 49 of Matthew 13 it says that the angels who are like the fishermen in this little picture moving among the fish as it were coming to separate the good fish from the bad it says literally in the passage the the wicked from the righteous and the million dollar question as it relates to the separation of the fish the separation of the goats the separation of the righteous and the wicked is this the question is this what would make a man or a woman righteous so that he would be entered into the kingdom and translated and fit to be able to live on the shores of eternity well i got some bad news and some good news the bad news is this the bible says that there are none righteous well that's kind of bad news the angels aren't going to have any good fish. In fact, it says there are none righteous, no, not even one. Say it this way. There are none righteous, no, not even you. Not even me. But here's the good news. The good news is this, comes out of 2 Corinthians 5.21. He who knew no sin became sin on our behalf so that we could become, by a miracle of God, the righteousness of God in Christ. what qualifies me all of a sudden to be a righteous fish, as it were, a righteous one, chosen of God, entering into the kingdom, is that he who knew no sin became sin on our behalf, that I could become the righteousness of God in Christ. More good news, Romans 5, God demonstrated his love toward us in that while we were flopping on the shore unrighteous and incapable of being righteous, he died for the ungodly. Having now been justified not by our effort but by his blood, we can be saved from the wrath of God through Christ. More good news, Romans 3.21. Now, apart from my perfectly performing the law to become righteous, did you get that? Now the good news is that apart from my perfectly performing the law to become righteous, the righteousness of God has been made available through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe. Romans 3.21 and 3 says this, For there are no exceptions, there is no distinction, all have sinned. and all fall short of the glory of God. I don't care how good you are, you'll fall in short. But being justified as a gift by his grace, we can have redemption which comes through Jesus Christ. John 1.12 says, But as many as received him, just received him, you're my only hope. I recognize you as my only hope. You are my redeemer. You are my transformer, my life giver. but as many as received him as that, to them he gives the power to do what they could never do by trying hard to be righteous. He gives to them the power to become a child of God, to whom God says in that day, Come ye blessed of my Father into the kingdom. Therefore, 2 Corinthians 5.20, Paul says, Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ. I want to make this more personal. I want to say this from me. Therefore, this morning to your heart, I am an ambassador for Christ. As though God were himself entreating through me, I beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God today. Beloved, the kingdom belongs to those men and women who in every generation, who for every aspect of their living, whether it be salvation or sanctification, living holy or their service. It is belonging, the kingdom is, to every generation of people who have a single-minded cry emanating from their hearts. And that single-minded cry is simply this. My only hope is Jesus. My only hope is Jesus. For redemption, for living a holy life, I can't crank it out myself, my only hope is Him. For serving Him in the arena of the kingdom, My only hope is him. Those are the ones who enter the kingdom and live in the power of the kingdom. Let's stand as we're dismissed. Jesus, I thank you for the truth of your word once again. Sometimes it's amazing to us as we see words in Scripture appear to us kind of cryptic somehow in the form of a riddle, and we wonder if there could possibly be any meaning for us. And over and over again, your spirit comes and energizes your word and affirms to us that not only are you the same yesterday, today, forever, but your word is alive again yesterday, today, forever. It speaks to us volumes. And there's a call to us as believers from this word to be alert, not only because you could come soon, but because you might not come soon at all. And that we need to be a people who are living our lives out, dependently, hanging on to you for dear life all our life. Make us that kind of strengthened people, dependent on you for our very breath. Not gazing at the sky, but living our life, faithfully proclaiming the excellencies of him who called us out of darkness and the light. But God, I pray too that among us, those who may be unredeemed, would somehow in their spirit hear a ring of truth and a call that is not coming from me, but it is coming from you, and it is a call into the kingdom that comes only by faith. And in Jesus' name, I'm aware even now that we cannot talk people into the kingdom. You can't produce a good argument and convince people. It's a work of your spirit. So in Jesus' name, I, along with all the redeemed in this room, call on you right now and ask that your spirit be released among us for redeeming life, for resurrection power to be released among us to those who are unredeemed, that you would break hard hearts, that you would soften hard hearts. And, Father, there would be a cry emanating from them that says, I've been looking at all sorts of other things that give me life, and I recognize today my only hope is Jesus, and I want to know him. If that is you, as we sing this last song, that will be our prayer together as a redeemed group, we want to encourage you to come, and there will be people up here who will be willing to pray for you and usher you into the kingdom. We want to make an invitation open to you as well if you're redeemed, and you just need a word, you need somebody to pray for you. The invitation is open as we sing. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
