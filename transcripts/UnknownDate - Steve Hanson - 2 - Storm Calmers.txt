Welcome to Church of the Open Door. Would you turn with me, if you will, to Mark chapter 4, verses 35 through 41. If you have your Bibles, if you don't, it will be on the screen. Same passage that Ephraim led us in last weekend. And as I read, I just ask you, would you sit in the boat? And would you see and feel these words? Late that day, Jesus said to them, let's go across to the other side. remember that phrase, the other side the disciples took him in the boat as he was probably tired other boats came along and a huge storm came up and how big, how huge waves poured into the boat threatening to sink it, that's how huge and Jesus was in the stern, head on a pillow, sleeping they aroused him saying, teacher, interesting title for Jesus teacher, is it nothing to you that we're going down we're drowning, we're overwhelmed, we're dying. Awake now he, Jesus, told the wind to pipe down and said to the sea, quiet, settle down. And the wind ran out of breath and the sea became as smooth as glass. Can you see that? And Jesus reprimanded the disciples. Why are you such cowards? Don't you have any faith anyway? They never answer that question. I think I might have because they were in absolute awe they were staggered and asked who is this anyway that even the wind and the seas are at his beck and call let's pray together Lord I thank and I praise you that we can be in this room this morning at the same time millions and millions of others around the world seeking you as well. We join them, they join us. Lord, we're in a boat together and sometimes we're in a storm and sometimes we're not. Sometimes the wind is blowing hard, sometimes it's not. But Lord, we want to be in the boat because that's where you are. Lord, breathe life into these words. Open our hearts. open our hearts in the name of Jesus I pray it Amen Amen Back in December of 1986 December of 1986 some 20 years ago Dave Johnson introduced me as a new open door pastor some 20 years ago and I was joining Dave Dan Adler the worship pastor at that time Joyce Polly the children's passage at that time and about 400 of some of you folks. We were over at Cooper High School. Thank you very much. Now, you like that look of a pastor. Would you like to come to him for prayer? That looks scary. You can pull it down now. And I was joining a staff here at Open Door that I felt was very unique, a very unique growing church. And that uniqueness was about grace. And if you were here, you know that. There was something so authentic about Open Door. Something so authentic. and it was about grace. It was about grace. And I was leaving a counseling ministry of 15 years to become one of you, to become a pastor at this, what I thought, unique church. And Dave asked me to share a few words, only a few words, because he was gonna fill the pulpit that morning. So he said, Steve, you got three minutes or something, so say hi. And so I looked at that people at Cooper High School and I said, I desire and I long to be involved in a ministry that when we look back upon it, we can see the fingerprints of God. I long to be in a ministry that's bigger than me. I long to be in a ministry that's bigger than us. I long to be in a ministry that at least sometimes we can feel, we can smell, we can hear God. And I know a lot of times ministry, life is about letters and phone calls and showing up to work. I mean, life is normal. But sometimes I want to look back and say, boy, that, that was God. a ministry that finds us sometimes asking that question that provocative question found in Mark chapter 4 verse 41 who is this man that even the winds and even the sea obey him sometimes finding us feeling at least sometimes in absolute awe and staggered because of his presence several years ago in 1990 1990, some 16 years ago I met with a team of people that I still meet with today they keep me on track and they confront me and they they like me and they say yes and they say no and at that time we were writing some vision mission statements, goals and those kind of things and this is one of the things we wrote for a ministry that we call Beyond Our Door, we still call it that we wrote this, we desire to be a people here at Open Door that, number one, are humbly aware of the needs of people beyond our door also. Needs of people on the other side. We desire to be a people who are, number two, gratefully aware of what he has given us, both as individuals and as a body. I want people who know and appreciate what God's given them. We desire to be a people here at Open Door who are intentional, strategic, and sacrificially responsive to the needs he brings our way. Can't meet all the needs. There's too many needs out there. But the needs he brings our way. At that time, we were a church known for being grace-filled, a church known for recovery. And we also wanted to be known for being aware, a church that was grateful, a church that was generous, a church that was intentional, both at home and on the other side, beyond our door. I wanted to be a people who touches needs and in doing so are touched. I wanted to be a people who were healed and therefore could heal. I wanted to be a people that were healed by healing. A people, like in Mark chapter 4, getting into the boat as we are. Going to the other side with our paddle, with our sail. Beyond our door. Sometimes the water is smooth. And you've been here for that. Sometimes the water is not smooth. And you've been here for that. Overwhelming storms. Storms beyond ourselves kind of storms. Huge storms. Waves pouring into the boat. Storms threatening to sink us. Storms threatening us. But we still got in a boat. We still paddled. We still set sail. Because that's where Jesus was. And that's what faith is. In a boat here in Maple Grove. And in a boat on the other side. as we are and as he is. Because that's where we want to be with Jesus. Sometimes we got to the other side because we just simply know how to paddle. We know how to set sail. We're good at some things. Open Door is good at some things. We've got five-year plans. We've got goals. We've got vision statements. We've got surveys. We've got teams. We do some things good. Because he has given us individually and as a body some gifts, some resources. sometimes we got to the other side because he intervened because he whispered and we heard and the wind heard and the sea heard because it needed more than our individual or corporate effort it needed more than our gifts it needed more than our documents it needed more than us we needed God in those times we found ourselves in absolute awe and staggered asking who is this man who was this man back in 1989 I sat on a rock about 8 o'clock in the morning in a small village in Haiti Treecoat Haiti some of you know that name I had no five year plan I had no thoughts of changing Haiti because now Open Door was there I just had a desire to know this young pastor who had vision and we had a desire to join him a desire to follow him and their vision, to get in his boat, to get on his sea, join his storms. D'Ocean Pierre, Pastor Dio, and I sat on a rock over at Silly Men's Hut watching 40 children begin their school day. 40 children begin a school day with two volunteer teachers beginning with a Haitian anthem, a Bible story, a song, and a prayer, and then off to a shady tree to learn math, history, whatever. That was back in 1989. And I sat there and wondered with Dio. I said, Dio, what happened if we would sponsor a child? Could we feed the children later, Dave? Could we pay the teachers? Could we provide them with uniforms? And he led, I spoke, and you responded back in 1989. And now 16 years later, there's 400 children at that school. They eat every day, and there's 20 teachers who are paid. There's a village economy. and that school has birthed 11 schools, 300 children. And now 16 years later, that village has a church of 200 people and that 200-person church has birthed five other churches of over 1,000 people. 16 years later, that village has running water. They've built houses for widows and orphans because that church believes in caring for the poorest of the poor because Jesus said that kind of stuff about 2,000 times, clearly. That village has had about seven medical teams from Opendoor, along with a number of other types of teams, who've gone there to live Haitian style, means rice and beans, goat meat, and no cell phones. And none of that was on my five-year plan. It wouldn't have occurred to me. One Easter morning five years ago, I baptized the area witch doctor. Five years ago, and it wasn't on my five-year plan. I assure you I was staggered and I was in awe. I baptized Gad Charles under a brown rushing river hoping not to lose him. His two children had been coming to our school for five or six years and he noticed. He noticed. That small church that small church in Treecoat one day gave me a bundle of Haitian dollars a bundle of Haitian dollars that I exchanged and it became 500 US dollars that I presented to this church. Their gift to our building fund. Bunch of people that make a dollar a day. Couldn't have been on my five-year plan. Just left me awed, left me staggered, left us humbled. Our first building fund for this building. D. Owen was the pastor that we asked several Augusts ago to join us on this stage to dedicate this building, this ministry. That was the big shot pastor we asked to join us. I mean, we didn't go out and find the denominational president or some big shot in Maple Grove. It was Pastor Dio. And that church in Tricot, Haiti, Ebenezer Baptist, was joining Open Door here in Maple Grove. And I just, how does this stuff happen? And you who have been part of that process for years, every one of you knew who'd been part of this process, this makes sense. Dio should be dedicating this building. Back in 1991, some 15 years ago, I found myself wandering into a small fishing village in Belize of Garifuna people. Garifuna people, the only African slave people that were never enslaved because they were shipwrecked. Their claim to fame is they got a free ride to the Americas. And now they're all over Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. and we wandered into this 1,200-person fishing village in 1991 and joined this 26-year-old Pastor Herdy Edwin Castillo in this small Mennonite church with a sand floor with a rusted roof and bamboo walls and about six to ten members in a village that were steeped in ancestral worship, straight from West Africa. And now, 15 years later, there's 200 people that worship there weekly. And about 200 of us have joined them in that village. to share ministry. Now 15 years later, we've helped Pastor Dio, Pastor Hurdy, who's very gifted musically, to write songs in his own language and produce three gospel CDs that are played all over Honduras, Guatemala, and in the country of Belize. They're on the radio all the time. You probably couldn't go to Belize and turn the radio on and not hear Pastor Hurdy. Some of the only gospel griff of the music in Latin America. It's their heart music, heart language. Now, 15 years later, we've helped fund some 10 conferences of Griffina people, of 300 people who come and worship and pray and plan. Four years ago, we started educating three brittle bone disease children in Hopkins Belize, Rahim, age 11. You cannot not love this boy. Cindy, age 8. Destiny, age 5 or 6. And they're learning how to read because of you folks. They're learning how to do math and geography. They're learning about their little bodies, bodies that will never roll over, never sit up, never walk. Rahim, I talked to him on Tuesday, and he told me in his helium voice, Steve, I want a laptop. And this little guy will figure it out. If we can get him a laptop, he will figure out education. We'll get him educational programs on. I said, no games, just educational programs. And he just, yeah. Four weeks ago, we hosted probably one of the biggest parties in all of Hopkins, Belize. and that was the 11th birthday party for Rahim. And why? Because two weeks earlier, he had double pneumonia and almost died. And it was just an obsession for us and his mother. We've got to provide him at least a last wonderful birthday. Second bout of double pneumonia, the Cuban doctor who lived in the village looked at Rahim and said, you can't die today, Rahim. And so he didn't. And the medicine and the oxygen arrived, as did a team from Church of the Open Door, to encourage him to continue moving on. These are things that have never found their way on my five-year plan. We just got in a boat, and we paddled, we sailed, and we asked Jesus during times of overwhelming storms, Help. Help. 1993, we joined Operation Christmas Child 13 years ago, And in those 13 years, we packed 15,000 shoeboxes for Christmas for kids who live in war, hunger, poverty, storm damage, the least of these, the overlooked, the ignored. And for one day, for one day, for one day, something different happened that was connected to the local church, connected to a colorful brochure that was given them in their language about the birth of Jesus. If 1% of those 15,000 boxes that you've packed, if 1% of them had a defining moment as a result of that brochure, as a result of that gift, as a result of that church, 150 children know Jesus different today. 150 children, because some of you chose to paddle by filling a shoebox. Some of you chose to sail by filling a shoebox or 20. And that shoebox got to the other side on a boat with Jesus on it, And there's parents all over the world wondering how did this happen. And I guarantee you the other 15,000 had an unbelievable day because they're not used to getting 20 gifts every day, every year like we do. So one gift is a defining day. And it was connected to Jesus. Back in 1990, some 16 years ago, we began collecting coins, quarters and nickels and dimes every February and March. And in those 15 or 16 years, we've raised $400,000 of change. A lot of people doing a little. And those $400,000 have provided surgeries for kids in West Africa with cleft lips and crossed eyes aboard the Mercy Ship. That $400,000 worth of change, coins, have provided a special needs homeschool in Belize for Rahim and Cindy and Destiny called the Rasinda's School. And soon that $400,000 will provide a special needs home in Port-au-Prince, one of Madame Dio's dreams. And I knew that back in 1986 when I sat at a rock with Pastor Dio. I look back and think, that's a change. Pocket change is providing for one of her dreams, one of her visions. Coins, special needs, Maple Grove, Hopkins, Belize, Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Coins, $400,000. It never occurred to me back in 1986. Three years ago, 2003, we began something new around here when we moved into this building. And what was new was this Beyond Our Door special fund. A fund for the other side. In those three years, we've raised $650,000. And that was during a time we moved here. And when you move from the Crystal Building to here, there are more light bulbs. There's more Florida vacuum. There's more snow to move. There's more grass to cut. There's more staff needed. We've raised $650,000 and moved in here with increased budget needs here. And during a time, you all know, of a very flat economy, we've raised $650,000 for not us but for those on the other side. We got in a boat with Jesus. And if I had time to tell you our pilgrimage in the inner city of North Minneapolis or our pilgrimage with HIV, you'd understand this wasn't just a quick decision. This was several years of process moving towards this. In those three years, we've been a major player in a strategic, holistic ministry in the north side called the Sanctuary and the CDC. And part of that $650,000 has gone to invest in those people and their vision. you heard last week, Pastor Ephraim, share about in those three years, 800 people are coming together to worship in the near north side and consider the needs of their area. Ephraim talked about the storms on the near north side. I was at one of the storms on Friday night. A peace march, a peace march. Some 1,500 people and one gunshot. That's how much peace is needed in the near north side. a gunshot and somebody shot, somebody in the hospital. But half of that $650,000 gives hope to those dear folks. 2003, three years ago, the Beyond Our Door Fund sailed to the HIV infected and affected in Uganda and Kenya. Almost half of that $650,000 has been invested in long-term strategic partners who are in ground zero of that pandemic in Masaka, Uganda, which is 20 minutes away from where HIV was first discovered in ministries that we have a long track record of. World Vision, Kalan Gwari Islam of Huduma Ministries in Kenya. And during those three years, you've heard me speak. You've heard Princess Zulu speak from Zambia. You've heard Steve Haas, the World Vision Vice President, speak about HIV in sub-Sahara Africa, countries where they talk about 20% of the people are infected with HIV AIDS. That means 100% of the people are affected. It never ceases to amaze me when I ask a group of people in southern Uganda or in Kenya, do some of you know people who have HIV? And everybody knows somebody, and everybody knows somebody they're related to. you've heard me share statistics 8,000 people die every day as a result of HIV that means 300 will die during the service in sub-Sahara Africa 2,000 babies are infected every day simply because they're drinking off their mother that means 80 will be infected during this service the lifespan in some of those countries is 35 years which means middle age is 17 churches it's not unusual to have 10 funerals a week. They don't have individual funerals. They have Saturday morning group funerals. You've heard me share words like least and lost and ignored and overlooked. Storms, waves, sinking to, threatening to sink the boat. And in the boat are people, our moms, our grandmoms, our children. You've heard me introduce names to you. These are real people, children raising children because mom and dad have died. children like Peter, Katabasi, James, Susan, and Simon who when their folks were sick they cared for them young children caring for their mom and dad and then they buried their mom and dad and they buried them along with two of their sisters children like Robert Calissa and Vianney and Vianney is now the younger one is now gone, he's dead last year I saw him in the hospital probably two months before he died and you looked at his little body and you didn't know he didn't have long to live. HIV got the little one. Children alone, children raising children by themselves in southern Uganda where there's more orphans per square mile than any place in the world because of HIV. We got in a boat with them and we built homes for them. We made sure their land was deeded. We provided water runoff. their new tin roofs into a system so they could keep clean and have water close by for their animals and for their seeds. We gave them hope. We joined their storm. We joined their storm. And in a minute, you're going to see and hear from Peter Katabasi. You're going to hear him thank you. In a minute, you're going to hear Robert Calissa saying thank you. God bless you. You've heard me talk about grandmothers. And these are old women who, their children have died for HIV, so they've inherited grandchildren. Grandmothers are supposed to be taken care of in that culture, and now they have to continue taking care. Grandma Oliver has seven grandkids to take care of. Grandma Ligaldi has nine. Grandma Matilda has four. And you're going to see and hear, you're going to see them, you're going to hear them in a minute at their new house. They have hope because you've gotten a boat. You've joined their storm. You've heard about a Seventh-day Adventist church in Casua, a church that when I first got there was no roof, no floor, no windows, no doors. It was a church with only walls. We used to refer to ourselves as a church without walls. This was a church without roof and floor. And when I got there, they weren't asking me for a roof and a floor. They were asking me, they were asking us to help with the desperate in their neighborhood. the desperate in their neighborhood which is all around them they they took me to Immaculate 27 year old Immaculate who then had 5 now has 6 children little ones not because of a loving man but because of men she couldn't run for because she has polio she not only has polio now she has 6 kids and she has HIV nothing she asked for and that SDA church along with Catholics along with other Protestants along with Muslims took me to Immaculate's house the religious in that area had no time to debate issues had no time to debate theology because their neighborhood was dying and so they did what any normal folks do they get together and in a minute you're going to see and hear immaculate in her new house, on her knees, during a rainstorm, thanking us. In a minute, you're going to see me cutting a ribbon at a church that put all their building needs on hold because they had to care for the desperate. They did what Jesus would have done. And we were at the first service, three-and-a-half-hour service on a hot Saturday morning, Seventh-day Advent, just hot Saturday morning. And that church was full of Catholics, Protestants, and Muslims together worshiping. We shared a meal together, rice, chicken, and some other strange dishes, all served with warm water. In the next seven minutes, these images, I want to thank you. I want them to excite you and cause you to ask in the midst of an HIV pandemic, Who is this man? In the next seven minutes, you're going to see small business owners called micro-industry. These are ladies who have HIV and are dying. That we have helped with small businesses. We've trained them how to make dresses. They have kiosks where they sell in their neighborhoods. These are women who are infected with HIV and have been affected by your gifts, allowing them to have an income where they can care for themselves, an income where they can feed their bodies to keep them healthy and care for their kids. And I want these images to encourage you to continue paddling and setting sail with your resources. I want these images to cause you to ask, Who is this man that even the wind and the sea obey him? For the next six minutes, seven minutes, I want you to lean back, and I want you to get in a boat, And I want you to enjoy these images and know these images have something to do with you. Thank you. Thank you very much. We are thankful for remembering open door every day. I'm always happy because you are. Give her your patience. In the name of Jesus, I pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you. Thank God for open doors. I am broken But you are my best friend And you remain You are my best friend And you remain Mr. Stephan, I really thank you for all the good things you did for me. And I'm really so grateful for all that you've done for all of us. Thank you. Can you, Jesus, will set me free? I have been searching Waiting and wanting For someone to hear my cry Look at Simon. Look at Simon. I have been asking And searching for answers To questions deep inside Please make me feel free When your love came down and rescued me All of my life I don't know So what does that love? I'll make it smile I bet you came into my life I'll be strong In the name of Jesus, I'll be strong Thanks, Sarah Thanks, Sarah Thanks, Sarah Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Here we go! his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, that he has everlasting life. - Stand. Would you stand with me? Now you'll probably get a little glimpse of why I love being there. Lots of hugs, lots of kisses. I can wear the same clothes every day. Don't have to comb my hair. Wear white socks. That was one day, by the way. I do change my clothes every now and then. I don't know how to close these kind of services. I don't know how to close the sale. I don't know how to do that stuff. I just want you to know that the investment that we're making beyond our door is not only significant, it is real. And you'll never invest. You'll never invest better. The ministries that we've chosen to work with have long-term relationships with us and what they say that we're doing we're doing. In the past three years Open Door we've built 20 plus homes for child headed for children raising children grandmothers raising grandchildren. We've given them hope. A place to sleep at night and not get wet. Immaculate a place to sleep where there's steel doors and steel windows where she can protect herself. three years have been doing that providing small businesses for ladies who have been infected with HIV virus not because of their doing but because a husband came home from the city after two months and unknowingly gave her the virus teaching them how to make dresses and how to care for animals and how to sell at their kiosks. Three years of providing a public health nurse who teaches people how to take antiviral drugs appropriately, who teaches prevention and care. We've seen the stigma in the church of HIV lessen. We've been in a boat for these three years and this storm, and will continue to be, this storm's not going away, but it's lessening for some families. in southern Uganda and the Kalangwari slums of Nairobi, but also in Katali, Kenya, and Bangladesh. We've sent our treasure and our heart has followed. We've noticed our heart and our treasure has followed. We have, we are, and we will continue to sail to the other side, the other side called HIV, AIDS. And on behalf of those people and others, Open Door, thank you. In three years, we've raised $350,000, and our goal this year is $300,000. And as Dave said last week, why stop at $950,000? Let's shoot for the million this year. And I promise you, I promise you, it'll be the best money you've ever invested. Let's not forget the light bulbs here. Look at that bulletin every week and look at the general fund. Please do that. But over and above that giving, let's look for a way that we can raise $300,000 or $350,000 this year so we can continue the ministry that Ephraim is leading us in in the near north side and that World Vision and Huduma Ministries in Uganda and Kenya are leading us in. Next week I'll be back along with Dave and one of our elders to talk about northern Uganda, an area that we have been thinking and praying about for three years, an area where children have been abducted for 20 years to be soldiers, brainwashed into killing machines. And we're involved in recovery ministry there with World Vision. I met a 16-year-old boy that's been in the bush for eight years, being a killing machine for the Lord's Resistance Army. And now he's in recovery. And you can understand that's a lot of recovery. this area has got double the rate of HIV because of their lifestyle because of that Lord's Resistance Army kids have been taught to drink blood kids have been taught to wash themselves in blood kids have been, go to headache, go to bed every night and have nightmares and headaches when they don't see blood we spent four days up in northern Uganda and we heard their recovery staff talk about the only thing that's going to take this away is forgiveness. The only thing that's going to take this away from the kids who are recovering is reconciliation because love wins. Love wins. Please come back next week. Let's pray together. Lord, I thank you for the boat that you have us in, both here in Maple Grove, the near north side, and the HIV infected and affected in sub-Sahara Africa. Lord, I pray even right now that you might be opening up our hearts to how we might paddle this next year. Lord, for some of us, it's as simply as writing a check. For others, it's a matter of sitting down and really thinking about how can I manage some money here or there? And I pray that you might, all of us, be looking for ways that we can be a part. In the name of Jesus, amen.
