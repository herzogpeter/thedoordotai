For the working of your spirit among us already. Father, I'm grateful for the movings that cause our hearts to be tender and open to you. I'm grateful. I just pray that that work of your spirit would continue as we break open the word and hear from you. I pray that in your name. Amen. Amen. Text this morning is actually connected to where we are in our study, but indirectly. 1 John 3 verse 1 says this. See how great a love. Some of your versions say, behold, what manner of love. The Father has bestowed upon us that we should be called children of God, and such we are his children. Now we are the children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we shall be, but we know that when he appears, we will be like him, because we'll see him just as he is. And everyone, that's a lot of people, everyone who has this hope fixed on him actually ends up purifying themselves. This has a purifying effect, just as he is pure. Part of the reason I was drawn to that text is because of what we're talking about these days, what we talked particularly about last week and even did last week. Last week, if you were here, I'm sure you recalled it, and are dealing with the sixth beatitude, blessed are the pure in heart. We concluded our thoughts around that by suggesting that a significant part of actually developing an authentically pure heart would be to recognize and be honest about the fact first that most of our hearts are a lot like that field that Jesus described in his parable in Matthew 13 that had four different kinds of soil all in the same field, four different kinds of soil all in the same heart. Some of the soil, really good soil, fertile and receptive. So when the farmer went out to sow the seed in Jesus' parable, the seed took root and good things grow just like in your hearts. When the seed of God's word got planted, maybe for some of you years ago, for the first time, good things began out of that good soil to grow, but some of the soil in the farmer's field was weedy and some of it was rocky and some of the soil was so rocky that the seed just bounced off having no effect at all, so nothing was able to grow in that particular part of the field. So parts of the field were fertile and part of it was weedy, just like our hearts at times, because there's weedy places and there's rocky places and sometimes places that are so weedy and rocky that nothing's been able to grow in that part of the field and that part of your heart, my heart, for a very long time, which raised for us the question we closed with last week. Would we be willing to do some work in the field? To do some heart work. The kind that David did. And actually this is the beginning of the heart work when David said in Psalm 139, I'm going to invite you in, God, and ask you to search me. Search my heart and know my heart. Reveal to me my heart. and see if there be any weedy way, hurtful way is what the text says. But Lord, I want you to show me the weedy places and the rocky places, because I'd really like to have a heart that is congruent, authentic, undivided, which if you were with us last week, you know is what it means to have a pure heart. Congruent, authentic, undivided. Well, last week, I'm sure you remember if you were here, that we ended our service, actually, by providing some time, extended period, about six minutes, actually, of time and space to do just that, to quietly, individually and corporately, invite God into all the chambers of our hearts. And we asked him to show us the weedy places and the rocky places while we were still sitting here. And I obviously don't know all that happened in people's hearts when we did that last Sunday. I think it was good, the exercise, and hopefully helpful. But later I wondered, what if in doing that little exercise last week, some of you who really do love God from the heart and in opening up your heart to God to show you your stuff, God, I really want to see my stuff. I wonder if any of you ended up seeing actually more weedy soil than fertile soil. Ended up when you were honest about what God showed you, ended up seeing more rocky places than receptive places. Indeed, I wondered if for all the rocky and weedy places, some of you couldn't see any fertile places at all. And I wondered if you experienced that if you got discouraged. Now, I don't know what you do when that kind of thing happens to you, or even if that kind of thing happens to you when you get overwhelmed by the weedy places, when you're honest about what's going on inside. But when it happens to me, and it does happen to me, sometimes I think, what's the use? Because not only do I have lots of weeds, but the ones I pull grow back. So why bother? A pure heart? Oh, nice sermon. fat chance see when we did that little exercise last week at the end of the service I did it too and sitting on a stool up there while the lights went down and we played some soft music I said Lord show me my weedy places and rocky places and he did he showed me some stuff but mostly on Sunday when I was doing that it was just sweet actually it was sweet stuff kind of misty eyed thing it felt pretty good actually I felt better than not good. I mean, I actually felt kind of noble for even asking, you know. I mean, you know, who but somebody with a really good heart would even ask God to do this, you know. But here's the deal. Here's the deal. You see, the way this kind of stuff works in real life, at least in my real life, is that when I ask God for something like that on a Sunday, with all the lights turned down and all that kind of stuff, it doesn't, I don't actually see this stuff till Thursday. And it doesn't come in the context of a mystical experience in church where the lights turned low and the music playing softly, and it isn't God who speaks to me. Far more likely, it's my wife who says because of something I said or something I did, Dave, you're so full of weeds. And my wife loves me. It's not God's voice I hear. Sometimes it's a voice of a very good friend. Sometimes it's a voice of a very irritating friend. Or maybe just some difficult circumstance that reveals to me at times I'm not expecting it and not asking for it. The weedy places and the rocky places and the shallow places and sometimes, and this is what's really discouraging, they're the same old places. And when they are, I often hear this voice, And when this voice comes in this context, it's often a very convincing voice, especially when I see the weeds. And what the voice says is this. What's the use? You'll never change. People don't. People can't. Pure in heart, fat chance. Become like Jesus, the way Stephan was talking about. Oh, please. And all of that is why today I want us to hear another voice. indeed it's a voice that I began to hear faintly two weeks ago when I just began to study this pure in heart thing and it wasn't really a voice I hope you know I don't hear voices it's kind of a metaphor it was a verse actually I heard the one one of them that I read at the beginning of the service first John 3 3 and the reason it caught my attention relative to this pure heart thing and the weeds thing was because this verse held a promise. And it was a promise that stirred up hope. And the hope it stirred up was that the weedy and rocky places of my heart and your heart do not ultimately define the condition of my heart. And that every bit of work I do and you do to pull the weeds, even the ones that grow back, and plow the ground, every bit of work I do is worth it because all of it is moving towards something glorious, something worth it. We are becoming. And the promise was this in 1 John 3, 3, that everyone who has this hope fixed on him will purify himself. In other words, they will do it. They will change everyone. That's a huge promise. Who has this hope fixed will do this, which means, among other things, this, that if we're going to know the reality of a pure heart and not just pretend and actually deal with the weeds, especially if all you can see right now are the weeds, then we're going to have to get our hopes up. Then we're going to have to get our hopes fixed on something other than the weeds. So fix your hope on him, it says in the middle of verse 3, but it started in verse 1. That's where I read the whole section at the beginning of this sermon. So begin by fixing your hope, not just on him, but on how great a love he, the Father, has given unto us. Fix your hope on this. You got a bunch of weeds? Okay, we're going to get to that. But you better know something. Weeds or not, you need to see how great a love the Father has given unto us, that we should be called. The children of God and such we are. Weeds and all beloved. Verse 2 says, now we are the children of God. You've got to come back to this with all the shame you've got around the weeds you have. And it has not yet appeared what we shall be. Indeed, it's sometimes hard to see what we're going to be and who we are becoming for all the weeds you see right now. But we know that when he appears, we will be like him. That's where all of this is headed. That's the program of God for you and me and us. For we will see him like he is, and everyone who has this hope, this focus on him, will purify himself. We'll begin this process of becoming who we're going to be now. Because everyone who has this hope does this. But the key in hanging in there with all of this, to doing this, is not just trying hard to do it. It's not just the key to this. It's not just trying hard to have a pure heart and even pull all the weeds in your heart. The key is, first of all, to get your hopes up. It's, first of all, to get your hopes fixed. So let me try to help you get your hopes up today, especially those of you who are having a hard time seeing anything but the weeds. and the way I want to help you get your hopes up is by remembering some things. By remembering, first of all, who your father is. Because if all you can see right now is weeds, remembering who your father is will help you get your hopes up. I want to talk about paternity. And I want to help you get your hopes up by remembering not just who your father is, but I want to remind you who you are. So I want to talk about paternity, who our Father is. I want to talk about identity, and I want to help you get your hopes up by remembering where all of this is headed. I want to talk about destiny, all of which yields a kind of tenacity when you get those three things back in your spirit. Paternity, identity, destiny. It gives birth to a kind of tenacity, a highly motivated pursuit for purity, congruity, authenticity for becoming who God's called us to be. Because everyone who has this hope fixed purifies himself. You will do it just as he is pure. Let me say it in language that actually I can understand. We got something to play for. We got something to play for. It matters that we don't listen to the voice that says what's the use. Because that voice is designed to get you to just go, let the weeds grow. It doesn't matter. It's no use. It's not going anywhere significant. It matters. We're playing for something. It matters that we keep pulling the weeds, even the ones that grow back. Because all of this is moving toward who you are ultimately becoming and who you will ultimately be eternally. This is a weird illustration. But how many of you know I'm a Bears fan? It's kind of a big joke. I've been here all these years, and I'm still a Bears fan. I grew up in Chicago. How many of you know the Bears are playing the Vikings tomorrow? Two or three of you? Yeah. Here's a flash. I don't expect much from the Bears tomorrow. There's a whole bunch of reasons. But chief among them, as it relates to this text, is this. Is this. This is why I don't expect much of them. They have no hope. They're not playing for anything. Except pride. Good. And stopping Adrian. They got nothing to play for. We do. So here's the message, church, to the open door. It's time to get your hopes up. It's time to get your hopes fixed by remembering who your father is. I'm talking paternity. How great a love the father has given unto us that we should be called the children of God. and such we are. It's an interesting phrase, actually. How great's a love. Some translations, as I said at the beginning, render it, what manner, behold, what manner of love. It's actually one Greek word in the Greek. And in classical Greek, it means from what country, from what race, what tribe. In other words, what kind of foreign love is this? From what planet did this kind of love come from? Because this love is declaring me and you to be not just forgiven, not just redeemed, not just a slave, exonerated and allowed to live, but this unworldly love is calling us his children. Which means I belong in the house. I'm not just a guest. I'm not even just a welcome guest who gets to sit at the table. I belong at the table. Because I'm his child, I'm the object, and so are you of his affection and watchful care. I am my father's son. You are your father's daughter. So get your hopes up. Because you can become like the father who gave you life. And every weed you pull is worth it. Even if right now you see more weedy soil than fertile soil. Because all of this is moving toward who you are becoming and who you will eternally be like him. 1 John 3, 2. And in this relationship with our Father, there is no condemnation ever, not even for the weeds. Correction, yes. Confrontation, yes. Consequences, yes Condemnation, never In fact, when the condemnation comes That's a different voice It's very important If you're going to stay in this journey Of following a rabbi And becoming more and more like the rabbi You're really going to have to discern the voices you hear Because that condemning voice It's a different voice It's not your father's voice Paul says in Romans 8 Nothing can separate you from the love of God your father nothing can do it. Life can't do it. Death can't do it. Principalities and powers can't do it. Things present, things to come can't do it. Nothing high and mighty, nothing low down and dirty, not even your weeds, shall be able to separate us from the love of God our Father, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. So get your hopes up. Get your hopes fixed on this. Because everyone who has this hope fixed, purifies himself. They stay at it. I'm going to pick that weed again because this is going somewhere. We've got something to play for. This little phrase, again, in that first verse of 1 John 3, that we should be called, that we should be called, the children of God, has very specific meaning biblically because it refers to that very special moment when your child is given a name. We shall be called, and they get a name. In Jesus' day, giving the child a name was more than having something you could call them. It was that. I mean, you had to give them a name, so when you call them, they would come. Bob, and then Bob would come. But it was also, and particularly, by the way, in Jesus' case, because there was a question around Jesus' birth, whose kid is he? And so in Matthew 1, 25, I love this, when Joseph named the baby Jesus, beyond giving him a name, he was claiming him as his own. So you, little baby, said Joseph to Jesus, will not be an orphan. You will have a physical father. You will be my child, and I will be your father, your mind. Behold, what manner of love the Father has given unto us that we should be called the children of God, and such we are your mind, says God. So get your hopes up. Get your hopes fixed on this, because everyone who gets their hope fixed will stay in the game. We'll keep pulling the weeds. Even when they grow back, they'll pull them again. Not listening to the voice that says, what's the use? You'll never change. Pure in heart, fat chance. Become like Jesus? Oh, please. Beloved, we need to remember who our father is. I'm talking paternity. We need to remember who we are. I'm talking identity. And we need to remember where all of this is headed, I'm talking destiny, because even though it has not yet appeared, who we shall be, and sometimes for all the weeds, it's hard to see and hard to believe will be any different. We know that when he appears, we will be like him, and everyone who has this hope fixed stays in the gate, purifies himself, does not just sit passively waiting for the day I go to heaven and you get this, he's going to wage a magic wave, a magic wand. No, I want to be actively involved in that becoming who I'm going to forever be now. Because that's where all of this is headed. I'm talking destiny and people who can see it, who live with a sense of it, start walking toward it now. They purify themselves now. You know, this whole thing we've been talking about, for quite a long time now, this rabbi follow the rabbi thing we're doing is all about what I'm talking about today. What even Stephan was talking about and bringing us into in the context of our worship this morning has been since day one of this series, this following and becoming like Jesus. Because the whole point, even in Jesus' day, of following a rabbi, any rabbi, not just Jesus, but any rabbi, was ultimately the reason you would follow him would be to become like him. You might even remember some of the history we did around that. It was even why rabbis were very careful about who they picked because they wanted to pick someone who could carry their yoke effectively, who could indeed carry on after they were gone the legacy that this particular rabbi had. And so when Jesus said to his Talmudim, Lechacharai, come, follow me. Even though they probably didn't believe in themselves, he called them to follow him as their rabbi, at least in part because he knew they could follow him. And he knew they would become like him if they followed him. And they had some weeds, those disciples did. And some rocky places, too. And some fertile places, too. Now I want to impact this destiny thing just a little bit This becoming like him thing From a slightly different angle Historically there have generally been two heresies Related to the identity of Jesus Who we're wanting to become like In the context of this talk today First heresy was that Jesus wasn't really God That he was and is a great teacher A good and moral man a prophet of some kind, maybe even a miracle worker of sorts, but not God. Question. Now, who do you generally associate with holding that perspective? I don't know who comes to mind, but for me, generally, I think of liberal theologians, maybe the culture at large, who try to make Jesus less than God, and we're kind of always fighting against that kind of thing. Second heresy is exactly the opposite of that one. Second heresy is that he wasn't really human. A heresy, that I'm not as familiar with, quite frankly. But in biblical times, this was a view that was actually held by a group of people called the Docetists. Talked about this with you before, especially when we were back in 1 John, because that was the big heresy that John was confronting in 1 John. The word Docetist comes from the Greek word dokeo, which means to seem. So a Docetist would say about Jesus that he wasn't really human. He just seemed to be human. They were very uncomfortable with his humanity, which might make you wonder, what's wrong with that? When you first hear that, you go, okay, okay, I think the answer is that he was fully human, but what's the danger in this? Well, think about it. If Jesus wasn't really human, if he was only really God, then whatever else Jesus was or wasn't, he wasn't like me or you. So the prospect of me becoming like him, really, doing what he did, saying what he said, living, loving, serving like he did, is more than a stretch. It's a bit of a joke. Why? Because he's God. So he can maybe be my savior, but he can never be my model. He can never be my mentor. Not really. He's God. And that's cheating. It's supposed to be funny. now okay who do you genuinely associate with that perspective nobody i don't think i mean i never heard of a dose of this before i did that first john study but think again think more because because i think many of us actually hold this view many of us hold this view not consciously i mean we'd get the answer right on the test jesus is fully god and fully human. I mean, I can kind of recite that in my sleep. But functionally, the thought of really becoming like him is actually kind of quaint. It's nice that you want to be like Jesus, but it's not very realistic after all. He's God, not at all like me. It's funny, when I was a kid, I remember trying to come to grips with what Jesus was like. I mean, I picture myself like eight years old, 10 years old. Picture a kid like, you know, trying to go, what was Jesus like? How do I relate to him? And I sometimes wondered if he was like Superman. I think I've shared this with you before. This is my favorite illustration around this. I didn't know it at the time. When I was thinking about Jesus as Superman, I was becoming a docetist. That 10 years old, who knew? See, Superman looked human, but he wasn't. He just seemed to be human. Fact is, he was a strange creature from another plan with powers and abilities far beyond that of mortal men, faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound and who disguises Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice, and the American way. Thank you very much. Now, if you're laughing, it's because you saw the black and white version of Superman. That's what I grew up in. When I was a kid, I loved Superman. I wanted to be Superman. I wanted his muscles. I wanted to be able to fly. I wanted to stand there calmly while people fired guns at me in vain. But there was something about Superman that even at eight years old, instinctively I knew, and what I knew was this, that we were not the same. See, I could admire Superman, but he could never be my role model. Superman could rescue me and save me from the bad guy, but I could never be like him, not really, because he's not human. Now, no one ever taught me this intentionally. But as a kid, even into some of my adulthood, unconsciously, I related to Jesus exactly that way. He could rescue me, and I'm glad he did. It's part of what infected the wonder of my worship, and it was sincere. I just thank you, Jesus. I was so grateful, but I could never be like him. Not really. Don't get me wrong. We talked about becoming like Christ. We talked about it all the time. But who are you kidding? He was God. He was a strange creature from another planet with powers and abilities far beyond that of mortal men and women like you and me. I mean, seriously. Jesus loved his enemies. You don't actually think it's possible for ordinary people like you and me. to enter into that kind of life. I mean, Jesus was God. Beloved, it is precisely because of this heresy that the writers of the New Testament are so insistent on making this point that Jesus was a real human being, that he emptied himself of all the rights and privileges and power that belonged to him as God, Philippians 2, and that he was made in the likeness of his brethren in every way, Hebrews 2, and because of that he sympathizes with our weaknesses because he's been tempted in all things just like us Hebrews 4. Sometimes, you know, even the songs we sing subtly mislead us. Away in a manger. We sing it at Christmas, big Christmas favorites. The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes, but little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes. Why? Well, he's God. I kind of picture him in the manger, sitting there thinking, I'm an omniscient little infant. You know? But I'll gurgle and coo to fool Mary and Joseph. Yeah, thank you. You're laughing. It gets me thinking of other things that are funny. I'll go back to the Superman thing. The hardest thing about Superman when I was a kid was going, how could he not tell? I'd want to tell someone. And I thought, you know, that's how you get to be picked, Superman. They pick someone who wouldn't tell, so I would never get picked. So, but the same thing with Jesus. Think about him, 10 years old, walking around at recess in Bethlehem someplace. You know, I'm God. Anyway. But you know what? That's why this Away in a Manger thing, it's why I prefer the song we sang today. I don't know if you noticed the lyrics. But we didn't sing No Crying He Makes. He's saying this one, he's holy and high, but there's comfort to see that little Lord Jesus, he cries just like me. See, unlike Superman, Jesus got tired and Jesus got hungry and thirsty and lonely and cold. And unlike Superman, Jesus felt real grief, shed real tears, felt real pain. Bullets did not bounce off his chest. Those nails went right through his hands and right through his feet and that spear pierced his side quite easily. But right in the middle of all that human stuff, he lived a different kind of life marked by a different kind of love and compassion and courage, joy, peace, and power. And it's that life that he invites his Talmudim into. It's called life in the kingdom of God right here and right now. Remember his message. We've been declaring it since we've begun this series on Jesus as rabbi. The kingdom of heaven is within your reach because Jesus did not come just to provide a way by which we could have our sins forgiven. He did, of course, do that, but he did much more than that because he came to make it possible for ordinary people like you and me to enter into and experience a different kind of life, his kind of life. We're right in the middle of all our human stuff, our disappointments, discouragements, and sometimes disappointments and discouragements with ourselves. Right in the middle of our temptations and kids and job and marriage and money and woundings and weeds, we could begin by putting confidence in Jesus and following this rabbi to taste and know a different kind of life, a different kind of love and joy and peace and power. And here's the promise. Everyone who has this hope fixed will stay in the game. We'll keep pulling the weeds, not listening to the voice that says, what's the use? You'll never change. Pure in heart? Bad chance. Become like Jesus? Oh, please. And it's why today I just wanted to remind you, who your father is, and how he loves you. I just wanted to remind you who you are. Think paternity. Think identity. And I just wanted to remind you where all of this is headed. Think destiny. Because even though it has not yet appeared, what we shall be, and sometimes for all the weeds you're looking at right now, It's hard to see and believe that it will be any different. We know, says the text, that when he appears, we will be like him. Which means, among other things, it will be worth it. So open door, get your hopes up. Get your hopes fixed on this. And all God's people said, amen. Amen. Amen. Ah, yes. Amen. Ah, yes. Would you stand with me as we close? Amen. Amen. Thank you for this hope. Lord, I think, there's my Christmas sermon, Lord. There's hope for Christmas. There is hope. And I thank you that you, alive in us, can, as we cooperate with you and follow you and stay in this thing, become more and more and more like you. That that is our destiny and we're walking into it right now. May that be more and more and more true of us. In Jesus' name, amen. God bless you. As you leave, you're dismissed. Thank you.
