Let's pray this morning as we open up the Word. for the kind of faith that believes. Even when it's hard to see and hard to hear, I pray for that kind of faith. And I pray that, God, your Spirit would use this word today to stir up in us that kind of faith that believes, even when we don't see it clear and can't hear it clear. I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Chapter 1, verse 12, where the apostles, having spent the last 40 days with the risen Christ, who had been presenting himself alive to them with many convincing signs and speaking to them of things pertaining to the kingdom of God. So it was a pretty packed and exciting 40 days. These apostles had gathered to wait in what Acts 1, verse 13 describes as the upper room, what we will kind of call today the waiting room for what Jesus had referred to. They were waiting for this promise of the Father. The promise of the Father is what Jesus described in Acts 1, verse 5, as a baptism of the Holy Spirit. Acts 1, verse 5, For John baptized you with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now. And when you do receive this baptism, you will receive from it what you need most in order to do the mission to which I have called you, verse 8, For you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be from this power enabled to be my witnesses, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest parts of the earth. Indeed, he says in Matthew 28, verse 19, what we know as the Great Commission, Jesus says, I want you to go and make disciples of all nations. I'm calling you to the nations, which is a pretty tall order, I'd say, requiring, among other things, I think, power, something beyond more mere talent or physical ability or capacity. If we're going to do the nations, there's going to have to be involved at some level, a significant level, supernatural, born of the Holy Spirit kind of power. And I promise, says Jesus, that you'll have it. He says in verse 5, Indeed, you'll get baptized into it. You'll be immersed into it. And when you do get this immersion, this baptism, you will be empowered by my Spirit to do what I have called you to do and to become who I have called you to become. But before that power comes, you're going to have to wait. Indeed, in verse 4 of chapter 1, he commanded them to wait. Look at verse 4. In gathering them together, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, which is precisely what they were doing as we pick up this story now today. In Acts 1, beginning in verse 12, because Acts 1, from verse 12 to 26, kind of a big section of Scripture, is going to give you whiplash. We weren't used to this in Colossians. Wow, there's many verses in one day, yes. The section here deals with the weight. That awkward, sometimes tense, certainly unsettling time that sits right between what I would call the promise and the power. Right between what I would call the promise of power and the power. When the promise has indeed been given, we heard it from the Lord, we saw it in the Word, we believe it to be true. but we do not have it in our hands. We cannot see it with our eyes or hear it with our ears. It is decidedly a place that's full of faith, but still it is an uncomfortable place to be. But it is in fact a very common place to be experienced by all of us, actually on a fairly regular basis, which is at least part of why I was so glad that a couple weeks ago, Steve Wayne spent two full weeks kind of unpacking and digging into what we have come to believe. And Steve, I've talked about this. Are we going to spend another week on this or not? What we really have come to believe is a critical and universally experienced reality of life in the kingdom of God. Because most of the time, we are living our lives, or at least some portion or part of our lives, in that place between, in that awkward and unsettling place between the promise of power and power, which is precisely, again, where they were in verses 12 to 26 of Acts chapter 1. So let me bring you now to the text beginning in verse 12. It says this, then they return to Jerusalem, just kind of picking into the story, getting into the story from the Mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, Sabbath day journey away, which is actually only about half a mile. A Sabbath day journey sounds like they spent a day. The rabbis determined that on the Sabbath day you could walk no more than half a mile. So a Sabbath day's journey is a half a mile. That's all for free. And when they entered Jerusalem, they went up into the upper room where they were staying. That is Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James, the son of Alphaeus, and Simon, the zealot, and Judas, the son of James, these all, and this is a very significant verse, it's gonna come up over and over again in the book of Acts, speaking to life in the kingdom of God as a community, these all with one mind, doesn't mean they were all agreeing about everything, and that they were all with one mind seeking God, continually devoting themselves to prayer, along with a number of women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers also, indeed. According to verse 15, you can see it right there in the middle of the verse, there's a parentheses, there was gathering in this upper room about 120 people, which is maybe a little more than you thought. Kind of picture that group of people. And then somewhere in the middle of all of this waiting, in verse 15, Peter stands up in the midst of the gathering, beginning in verse 15, and begins to talk about something that no one had talked about since all of these events had transpired. Jesus' crucifixion, his resurrection, 40 days, seeing all this, and then his ascension. Lots of things spinning, but now Peter is bringing up a subject. I don't know for sure, but I'm wondering, why do we have to talk about that now? He begins to talk about Judas. Why? He describes in verse 17 of Acts chapter 1 here, look at that, as one who was counted among us. Here we are waiting. A lot of wonderful things have been happening, and now we're talking about this guy. Remember, he was one of us. He was counted among us and received his portion of the ministry with us. But who had betrayed both Jesus and us, he says in verse 16, by becoming a guide to those who arrested Jesus. I mean, Judas brought him right to them, resulting in Jesus' crucifixion and his death, an event that if we go back now, I just want to keep these, thinking these happy thoughts about resurrection. and ascension and Holy Spirit baptism. When that happened, though, we were devastated and confused. But what you need to know, says Peter, in verse 16, is this, that as confusing and as bewildering as this event was to us, and as devastating as we thought what Judas did was, the fulfilling of God's purposes relative to the bringing of the kingdom and the fulfillment of Jesus' mission, you need to know, And I think this is what Peter's doing here. It's not just some random bringing up of Judas. You need to know the truth is this. Verse 16, look at that again. The Scriptures spoke of this long ago. And they had to be fulfilled. Indeed, the Holy Spirit, you guys, foretold all of this through the mouth of David a thousand years ago that Judas would betray, becoming a guide to those who arrested Jesus. Which means, among other things, this, that while we were stunned and even afraid that what Judas had done had maybe ruined everything and derailed God's plan. God wasn't stunned. He wasn't surprised. And he didn't begin to wonder, oh no, what am I going to do now? Because this ruins everything. No, it didn't. And no, it doesn't. Because God knew. God knows. Because God, not Judas. In fact, let Judas be not just a person, but anything you think is rocking it all. God, not Judas, is in control. Which sounds like a cliche. You know, God's in control. But here's the deal. That is something you need to know. That is something you need to remember, particularly when you're in that place between. The promise and the power. because in that place between the promise of power but not having the power, you're not sure. Verse 20, he then adds this, quoting again from the Scriptures, this time from Psalm 69 and Psalm 109. For it is written, Peter says in the book of Psalms, let his homestead, he's speaking prophetically here, actually of Judas, let his homestead be made desolate that no man dwell in his office, let another man take. And based on that prophecy, now we're going to do this business, says Peter. So it is from verses 21 to 26. We have an account in the text here of the apostles going about the business of replacing Judas, which seems a little weird, I think, in the context of the promise of baptism and the baptism of the Spirit that's going to come in chapter 2. It's like a board meeting breaks out right in the middle of, you know, chapter 1. We have to replace an elder. And how do we do that? But there they are doing it. Verses 21 and 22, they identify the credentials that are necessary. Look at verse 21. It is therefore necessary that the men have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning with the baptism of John until the day that he was taken up from us. One of these should become a witness with us of his resurrection. So that verse is a little confusing. Basically two credentials relative to the person we're going to choose to replace Judas. One is that they have been with Jesus the whole time, having heard what he said and seen what he did. And also this person, whoever it is needs to be an eyewitness of the resurrection because this mission we're on is going to require that kind of confidence in what we have seen and what we have heard. So they came up with two candidates who fit the bill. One was called Joseph, in verse 23, called Barsabbas, also called Justice, and Matthias. And then verse 24, they prayed. Good idea. And said, Lord, you know the hearts of all men. So show us the hearts of all men. Show us which one of these. We need to discern something here that you have chosen to occupy this ministry and the apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place. And then verse 26, they do the weirdest thing. Here they are looking for discernment, asking God for a word. And then without any, you know, nothing, Here's what they did. They drew lots for them. And the lot fell to Matthias, and he was numbered with the 11 apostles, which raises a number of questions. The first is this. At least this is a question that got raised from me. Are you kidding? I mean, seriously. They drew lots in the context of life where some serious discernment relative to what God is leading us into. They decide to flip a coin. Great idea, I'm thinking. Okay. Second question, at least that came up to me, was this. What does any of this have to teach us about what it means to wait, about what it means to live our lives in this place between the promise of power and power? Is there anything at all to learn from this? Well, I thought about this all week. I came up with nothing, so let's close in prayer. well to even try to answer that let me just kind of bring you back into the story the text i just read um setting the scene 120 people see him in your mind among them are the apostles along with some women and mary the mother of jesus his brothers as well all gathered in this waiting room and they are full of faith and hope um maybe more than than ever in their lives they're full of faith and hope having just spent 40 days, get your head around that, with the resurrected Christ, not just Christ, but they have spent 40 days with the resurrected Christ, which in my mind would have a pretty positive effect. I don't know, just thinking. Even among those slow to believe, being around the resurrected one for 40 days would turn that into faith. But the fact is this, by the time we get to verse 12, that 40 days of being with the resurrected one every day is over. Jesus is physically gone, having ascended to the Father, and he was out of their sight. A little phrase that's very significant. You see it in verse 9. Look at verse 9. And after he said these things, he said, this is Jesus speaking. It's kind of his ascension here. Not kind of, it actually is his ascension here. He was lifted up while they were looking on, and the cloud received him, and he was out of their sight. And out of their sight, they still believed. They were full of faith, but they couldn't see. And while this might sound like a ridiculous comparison, I thought about this week, and what came to my mind was I was likening that full of faith and knowing it's true, but not being able to... I likened it to how I sometimes feel on Monday morning. Honestly, when church was amazing, like it was last Sunday, if you were here, the November service, the sense of God's presence, the teaching is rich, the ministry is powerful, the worship transcendent, The vision is clear. You can see it. You can smell it. You can hear it. You're in it. It's the resurrected one with us. But now on Monday, you're on your way to work. You're dealing with the kids. You're going to your class. It's out of your sight. Acts 1 verse 9. I mean, you remember it and you believe it, but you can't see it. You can't smell it the way you did when you were there because it's Monday. And there you are again in that place between the promise of power and the power. And now you have to wait again. And when you're in the waiting room, that place between, you might begin to wonder. Not whether the promise is true, because you're still full of faith to believe that he can, that he will. But you begin to wonder, and now I'm kind of trying to dial into what these guys must have maybe been feeling in this upper room. You might begin to wonder when. Because if you remember, when Jesus reminded the apostles of the promise of the Father that they'd be baptized with this spirit for power, All he said about the when was, not many days from now. Can you give me some more than that kind of vague, but so like him to talk like that? Get specific, would you? Please, I love so many things about you, Jesus. That's not one of them. Just give me a time, because I will wait. And I can wait until Thursday at 4. I can do that. or longer if needed. I'm serious. Six months, three weeks, two days, 12 hours, five minutes. I'll wait. But then the head game starts. At least they do for me. They really do for me. As I begin to think, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh. He says, not many days. There's this place in 1 Peter that says, one day is a thousand years. Oh, my God. This is going to be a really long day. And there you are again, in this place between the promise of power and the power, and now you have to wait. The ancients actually had a term for this. It was so kind of common, so universal to human experience, particularly life, experience in the kingdom of God. And what they called it was liminal space, which is a term that I was introduced to some years ago through the writings of Richard Rohr, who defines liminal space as, and I'm quoting him here, the place of transition. It's the place of waiting and not knowing. It is a unique spiritual position, he says, where human beings hate to be, but where the biblical God is always leading them. It is when you've left the tried and true, what you've always known, how you've always thought, the way you've always been, it's when you leave all that, but you haven't entered fully into the new way of being and thinking and knowing. You're in that place between the promise and the power, and now you have to wait and wonder and listen and trust, even though you don't see the new. Rorke calls these liminal spaces. I love this quote. He calls them thresholds of waiting and not knowing our next. Have you ever not known your next? Well, then you're in liminal space and you didn't know it. Now you have a word for it and it's a Latin word so you can feel smart. Not only are these liminal spaces everywhere in life. They are inevitable to life, and they're everywhere in Scripture, as well as this rhythm and reality of life in the kingdom of God is played out over and over again. Begin with me, with considering Abraham. Abraham, who was given a promise. There's the promise, Genesis chapter 12, to be the father of nations, not just the father of a son and a daughter, nice family, you will be the father of nations. But to see the promise fulfilled, which would be the power of it all, he had to leave what he always knew, what he always thought, how he'd always been beginning a journey to a land he did not know, which speaks symbolically to this place between the promise of power, inheritance, and power. The inheritance. Indeed, Hebrews 11, verse 8 says that when Abraham was called, he obeyed by faith. Hebrews 11, verse 8, he obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, two key words indicates liminal space between your waiting. And the place he went to, he went out not knowing where he was going. and as a result, verse 9, he lived as an alien in the land of promise. He lived as an alien in the land. He was in the promise. He was kind of experiencing the promise, but he felt like, I don't fit here. As if he lived in a foreign land, never quite at home, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs to the same promise. I mean, that's a fascinating verse to me, evocative in its symbolism and reality because even though he was in the land, as it were, He was living in the promise. He never fully saw it. He never fully realized it. He never fully knew what his obedience would produce for generations, which actually may be the ultimate space between the promise of power and power. And what I just said there just stirs up thoughts and feelings of men and women. I have known who have been faithful, just kind of boringly obedient. And they never saw what their obedience gave birth to relative to inheritance for generations. I think often of the writers of Scripture. I mean, I've made reference to this so many times when we quote the Apostle Paul and he's writing from prison. And how many times, I just think he's writing the Scripture and he's going, I'm writing the Bible. He didn't think that. He didn't know if his letter would get to the Philippians, let alone to you. But he was faithful. In a prison, wrote the letter. Here we are. He did it in that space between. Then there's David, who as a young man was anointed as king. And when you're anointed as a king, you are the king, which is a promise. You're the king. There's your promise. Funny thing happened, however. You know the story of David and And Saul, a funny thing happened on the way to the throne. Saul's jealousy happened, and David had to wait in that space between the promise. You're the king. And the fulfillment of the promise when he really becomes the king. And then there's Christ himself. Picture Jesus, I'm sure you can, hanging on a cross. What's the promise as he's hanging on the cross? In agony. What's the promise? There's a promise here, Jesus. What is it? you're going to rise again there is the promise, resurrection but when you're on the cross you're in that place between the promise resurrection and the resurrection when Jesus was in that place I think full of faith I think on the cross Jesus believed I will rise but he felt forsaken my God, my God why have you forsaken me last week at our Novembering service, we remembered those places between. And as we reflected on and gave ourselves room to grieve loss, I'll never forget Wayne, who talked about his mom, and Erin Bennett, who talked about the loss of her children, Hannah and Charlie. And at one point, among the things that Erin said so eloquently and beautifully, if you were here, you remember this very well if you weren't. Don't miss that service again. At one point, Aaron quoted Romans 8.28. Romans 8.28 says this, for we know that all things work together for the good to those who love God. So in that verse, what's the promise? It's really clear. All things are woven together by God for good. Promise. But what if you're in that space between the promise? of power and power between the promise and the fulfillment of it. When you're in that space, you believe the promise, this will work together, but you ain't feeling it when you're burying your child. In fact, I think there is a way in which all of life is lived in this space between because even when the veil is pulled back, and it is pulled back once in a while, and the glory is revealed, and we have one of those moments where we can see. God gives us a word. Even then, says Paul, 1 Corinthians 13, 12, even when the veil is pulled back, life is like this. We see through a glass how? Darkly, dimly. We know in this life. We know in part. We prophesy in part. So if you get a word, you got a word, but you only got part of it. Don't be too cocky with this. but then face to face we will know and be fully known which is why the church historically continually prays even so lord jesus come quickly because it's hard to live in this place between so there they were all 120 of them okay come back to the story apostles along with mary uh some other women the brothers of jesus gathered together in the waiting room to wait because they were in that place between promise and power. So Peter stood in their midst again. Let's go over it again with these things I've shared with you, Acts 1.15, and began to talk about what no one had talked about yet, what they hadn't had time to think about yet, about how Judas, who was one of us, who countered himself among us, sharing in the ministry with us, betrayed both Jesus and us by becoming a guide. That word guide is like, a guide is someone who helps, like a fishing guide helps you. There's the fish. And Judas said, there, there he is. I'm here to help you. There he is. He helps them. Destroy is what he did. Not just Jesus, but the dream, or at least what they understood of the dream at the time, even after the resurrection. Acts 1, we didn't go deep into this. They were asking, is this the time you're going to establish a kingdom? Their idea of the kingdom of Judas ruined everything. In the moment is what they thought, and we were devastated, bewildered, confused, entirely blindsided by these events, which is at least part of why I think Peter says what he says in verses 16 and 17 when he says, in effect, this, that while we were bewildered and afraid, That maybe this had destroyed the dream, derailed God's plan. God wasn't bewildered or surprised. Indeed, it had to be this way because the scriptures had to be fulfilled. Which the Holy Spirit foretold us through the mouth of David a thousand years ago, which means, among other things, this. God knew. God knows. And God, not Judas, is in control. Which, again, sounds like a cliche. If somebody's really going through something hard, I probably wouldn't say, God's in control. I wouldn't say that. But sometimes when you're in that place between, you need to be reminded. You need to remember. So point number one. I mean, it's kind of late in the sermon to give you the first point. Point number one is when you're in the place between, rest. Find a way to rest in the providence of God, in the sovereignty of God. Be still and know. Second thing is this. Point number two, learn to listen for the voice of God when you're in that place between. Remember the need to decide, this goofy thing I talked about, between Barsabbas and Matthias. So they prayed, verse 24, Lord, show us which one, for you know their hearts. But then they drew lots, and because it fell to Matthias, he was chosen, which is, again, so weird. I mean, wouldn't that instill confidence in you? If somebody came out there, how do you choose elders who are at open door? Oh, we pick a couple, and then we fill up a coin. Paper, scissors, rock. That's how we do it. In fact, there's actually a few takes. It was interesting to me to study this this week that I think might be helpful to consider, particularly in this place between, because there are some opinions about what this is about. The first is actually, some have looked at this and the commentaries indicated what they did, what this is an example of is them making a mistake because they needed to wait, which is what you're supposed to do when you're in the waiting room is wait. And so the fact that they drew lots was really an indication that they couldn't wait. Proof to some who hold this view is that it's Paul, who they would say, some would say, was God's choice to replace Judas. He was the next apostle, but they wouldn't have discovered that without waiting. Interesting way to look at it. There's another view of this, however, just to muddy the water a little bit more, that I find interesting. It's this, because when you're in the place between, when you know but you don't know, where you see but you can't see, where you hear but you can't hear, when you are in that place, and some of you know exactly what it feels like to be in that place, I certainly do, there comes with that knowing but not knowing a kind of uncertainty that can sometimes shut people down, paralyze you. So maybe some suggest that the lesson to be learned here is that when everything is equal, and that is what you have here. You have Barsabbas, and you have Matthias, and this isn't between good and bad. That doesn't take a lot of discernment. This is between good and good. The credentials were the same. When everything is equal, flip a coin. As if to say, no, I don't like the flip a coin thing. I do like this, if what's behind this. As if to say, and sometimes we do need to hear this, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Lighten up a little bit. You know what? You're choosing between two. You're paralyzed with fear. You need to know you can't screw this up. Well, maybe you could. But most people can't. There are, listen, there are no bad choices here. In fact, if this is kind of the right way to take this, it's almost like he's saying, listen, listen, listen. He said, don't be afraid. Because sometimes when we're in that place between, we get paralyzed by fear. Afraid, I'm going to get it wrong. I'm going to mess up. And then we get into that God's will thing. Is it God's perfect will or permissive will? Oh, my gosh. I know people who get absolutely paralyzed around. Coke or Pepsi, I don't know. Oh. And if you pick wrong, it's ruined everything. Whoa, lighten up. Good discipline for you right now. Flip a coin. That's deep. No, it's not. Wow. And by the way, this confusing takes on all these different ones, and I'm not going to tell you which one is true. That's what it feels like to be between when you don't know. It's a fascinating picture of this in Acts 16, verse 6, about Paul, who in the middle of a missionary journey was passing through the Phrygian and Galatian region, so he's already left there. He wanted to go to Asia, okay? I want to go to Asia. But it says in verse 6, the Holy Spirit said, no. Okay, I don't like getting a no, but I like knowing. So it's real clear to me, no. That's a no. And that's nice to know. So maybe I'll go to Bithynia, he says. But again, the word is clear. The answer is no. I don't like getting a no, but I'd like to know. Verse 7 says that, in fact, the Spirit of Jesus did not permit him. So what do I do? This is where we get paralyzed. I need a word, don't I? A voice from heaven that makes it clear because I got one there about Asia, and I got one there about Bithynia, so I need one here. Which ironically can serve to paralyze us when it isn't perfectly clear when you don't fully see and you can't clearly hear, which is often how it is when you're in that place between. So what do I do? Acts 16, verse 8, it says, and passing by Mycenae, decided to go to Troas. Why? Did God give him a word? Did God say, yes, no, right, left? There's no evidence of that. So I'll just go to Troas, says in verse 8, as if to say, hey, lighten up. Just make a choice. Paul, do not live in fear. You can't screw this up. Still others suggested as they were praying, and this is an interesting one, that as they were praying and trying to discern in this waiting room, Being all of one mind, it says in verse 14, devoting themselves to prayer, that in that place of discernment, God actually told them, I want you to draw lots, and I will be in that. And I go, but here's the deal. Before you blow that off completely, consider Proverbs 16, 33, which is something they might have had in their head when it says this, the lot is cast into the lap, but every decision is from the Lord. Really? Really? Really? So you're supposed to cast lots Is that what you're saying? No, I'm not saying that Except sometimes Went to church today The pastor gave us three options Didn't tell us which it was Left us totally confused And that's what it feels like to be between So what do you do? How do you know? How do you discern when to take your best shot? Just decide when to do something weird, cast lots, weird. When to wait, when to go. Well, beloved, the answer to that is going to continue to unfold as we continue through the book of Acts, where over and over again we will hear these words repeated, that it was while they were all together in one place. Very significant, Acts 1.14. Being of one mind, which doesn't mean they all agreed. It means that all of them were there for one thing, of one mind. We are here to seek God. They were, in that context, ministering to the Lord, which speaks to a spirit of worship, and devoting themselves to prayer, Acts 1.25. In that context, all through the book of Acts, God would sometimes say, go, and sometimes say, wait, and sometimes say, send Paul and Barnabas away from here, and sometimes say, stop, and sometimes say, listen, Take your best shot. Don't be afraid. You can't screw this up. Because when you're in that place between the promise of power and power, when you can't really see and you don't fully know, you need, number one, to rest in the sovereignty of God. God's in control. He's on the throne. He's not surprised. And you need to listen for the voice of God, who sometimes says go and sometimes says stop and sometimes says wait and sometimes says send and sometimes says don't be afraid, just decide. Let's pray. Lord, teach us how to do that together. Gathered as we are, this church, Open door at this time, in this place, in one place, being of one mind, which we confess does not mean, Lord, we all agree, but we are here to seek you. Ministering to the Lord in a spirit of worship, devoted to prayer, help us to hear. In Jesus' name, amen. you
