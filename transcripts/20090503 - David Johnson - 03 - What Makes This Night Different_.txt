That you shall tell them it is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt. It's called the Passover meal. A meal traditionally begun with a question, often asked by the youngest child in the family or the gathering of people. And the question was this, What makes this night different from every other night? It was a question that was then answered with a story, which is something that we're dealing with these days as we examine the way that Jesus used stories, simple stories, to unveil the story, as it were, of God and his dealings with people. Indeed, this answer to this question in the Passover meal would often begin with these words. from a rabbi, maybe the father of the family. This night is different from other nights because once we were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, but the Lord our God took us out with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. It's a story of deliverance. It's a story of redemption, and it's a story that would be told over and over and over again, and the reason was to keep the story alive so people would know who they were and where they're from in relation to God. And as the story was told, in the context of this meal being unveiled for them, it would be explained in a variety of ways how the bitter herbs that were on the table and part of the meal were there to remind us of the bitterness and the harsh treatment we received when we were slaves in Egypt. And they would then explain how the salt water that they dipped the parsley in, was there to remind them of the tears they shed. And their forefathers and foremothers shared when they were in Egypt, and they would explain how the chopped apples and nuts spoke to and reminded them of the clay that they used to make bricks to build the houses and the cities of Pharaoh, and the candles were there to remind them that the Lord is our light and salvation. Whom shall we fear? They're there to remind us that God our Father has brought us out of darkness and into his marvelous light. And all of those elements that I just mentioned are actually on the table right in front of me. And you probably can't see it from where you're sitting. I would encourage you actually to come up and look at these elements. The bitter herbs are here. The salt water and the parsley is all here. And some of those things are vaguely familiar to you as being part of the Passover meal. But some of them not. But there is an element, or actually there's two elements that are consistent with or part of the Passover meal that we are kind of familiar with. Because they are elements that are also elements, the primary elements, of what we call, not the Passover meal, but the Lord's meal. The Lord's Supper, what we call communion, the bread and the wine. And in the Passover meal, it was unleavened bread. the primary characteristic of the unleavened bread was that there was no leaven. And that was intentional. It was like a wafer, like a cracker. I have some up here. There's some on the table. It would look something like this. And because it was unleavened, it would be flat like a cracker. But it wasn't just kind of the way they decided to do it. There was meaning in that. And spoke exactly, actually, to two things specifically, did this unleavened bread. First of all, it spoke to the fact that they needed to leave Egypt very quickly. No time left for the bread to rise. We just have to go. And so the bread was unleavened bread. It also spoke spiritually to the fact that we don't want to bring any of the old leaven of Egypt into the new life we have with God in freedom. But it also reminded them of something interesting. It reminded them of the scourgings that they received when they were in Egypt and the piercings they received. In fact, I have to pick it up again. The bread itself speaks to this. I don't know if you've ever noticed this with this kind of bread. There are stripes on this bread. You can't see it maybe on the screen. But again, come and look at this on the table. And even the wafers that we have for communion have this very thing where there are stripes and then there are piercings in the bread itself. And that is intentional for the Passover meal to speak up our time in Egypt when we were scourged and we were pierced as well. And then the wine, there was the bread and then the wine had significance as well. at this Passover meal. Actually, there were four cups of wine involved in this meal that went on for some time. There was the cup first of sanctification that they would pour and speak of that and drink the wine, and then the cup of wine poured for the plagues. Then there was the cup of redemption. And the final thing to culminate their celebration together was a glass of wine that was poured called the cup of praise. But the cup of redemption was the third cup of wine, And it was taken after the supper was eaten. It wasn't after the whole ceremony. The cup of praise was the last thing. But after the supper was eaten and there was a few things left to do, they would take this third cup. And the third cup of redemption was to remind them and to remind their children and their children's children of the blood of the Passover lamb that if applied to the door of their home, you may remember this story, would cause the angel of death to pass over them. Thus that word Passover. So when it says in 1 Corinthians 11.25 that in the same way Jesus took the cup after supper, saying, this cup is the new covenant in my blood, it was this cup that he took. It was this third cup of redemption, which he is saying now in a way that was kind of mysterious to the people who were originally hearing it. This third cup of redemption that reminds us of what God did is now my cup, and it's my blood. He was in the middle of the story, adding to the story. The story of God was getting bigger with these words of Jesus. The fact is, Jesus loved to celebrate the Passover meal with his friends, and it was something that he had done like all Jews in Jesus' day every year since he had been a little boy. But on the night in which he was betrayed, says the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 12, 23, he was celebrating this Passover meal for the very last time one day before he died. When at two critical junctures in the Passover meal, he added to the meal, he added to the story and the meaning of the meal, and he did this change, this adding to the meal and to the meaning of the meal, he did it with the bread and with the wine. Matthew 26, 26 records it this way, and 1 Corinthians 11 speaks of it as well, kind of blending those words together. Basically, they say that while they were eating the Passover meal, Jesus took the bread and he broke it, just like you would do. And the Passover meal, they would take this and they would break it, just like that. Jesus did that very thing. The way you would do it, you would break the bread. It was the Passover meal. It was the bread of affliction with its stripes, which speak to scourgings, and its piercings, which speak to the same. But this time he said, as he broke the bread, he said the most astonishing thing. Because this bread that you have been breaking your entire life, at this point in the Passover meal, this bread is my body, broken for you. And then he passed that bread. And then he said, do this in remembrance, not just of Pharaoh, though we'll remember him and God's deliverance from him. And not just for Moses and not just of Egypt, but do this in remembrance of me. And so now the stripes on the bread speak not just to the people of God being scourged. It speaks to Jesus' scourgings. And the piercings in the bread now speak to his. And then he took the cup also after supper, saying, and it was the after supper cup, the third cup of the Passover meal, the cup of redemption, which speaks to the blood of the Passover lamb applied to the door. This cup, he said, 1 Corinthians 11, 25, is now the new covenant in my blood. So from now on, this cup is to remind you not only of your deliverance from slavery in Egypt, but now your deliverance from sin and death. So once again, he was taking the story of God and adding to the story and adding to the meaning of the meal. But part of that meaning that he was adding to was actually being borrowed from some previous stories relative to God and his people, what I would call a weaving of stories, all of which add meaning to this meal. Finding their roots, as all of the ones I want to share with you this morning did, they find their roots in the bread and in the wine that we gather around today. So let me tell you a few of these stories. The first involves Abraham, a name that we're familiar with and a mysterious character that we're not as familiar with. His name is Melchizedek. Back in Genesis chapter 14, the setting is this, that Abraham is off to do a noble deed. And the noble deed he wanted to do was to rescue his nephew Lot, who'd been captured by Cheddar Laomer. He gets the job done. He rescues Lot. He's returning home in triumph. When he comes upon this man, he does not know, a little intimidating. His name is Melchizedek. He is the king of Salem, which eventually becomes known as Jerusalem. Having never met, Abraham doesn't know what to expect. Is Melchizedek a friend or is he a foe? Melchizedek answers that question without any words. In Genesis 14, verse 18, it says this, And Melchizedek, the king of Salem, brought out the bread and broke it, brought out the wine and poured it. And that meant something profound, particularly the bread and the wine, because it answered this question that Abraham had in his mind. Are you friend or are you foe? When he broke the bread and poured the wine, it meant we're friends. And he wondered, was it war or was it peace? And when he broke the bread and poured the wine, it meant not war, but peace. So relax, Abraham. You're in a safe place now. In Melchizedek, it says in verse 19, Then blessed Abraham, so they ate their meal with gladness of heart, and they broke the bread, and they poured the wine. It's the first kind of story around bread and wine in the story of God. Second story involves Jacob, Genesis chapter 31. Jacob, kind of a cruddy character himself, quite manipulative, and got in a lot of trouble, but in this situation, he's being ripped off himself in a variety of ways by his father-in-law, Laban. And he gets tired of this treatment and decides he had been living with Laban and his family. He decides to leave Laban's house and also to bring with him everything that Jacob thought was his, his own cattle and his wealth, along with Laban's daughters, Leah and Rachel. So Laban, not real happy with that, pursues Jacob with angry intent, desiring actually to kill him. But in the pursuit, this strange thing happens. It was a pursuit that took seven days. And in those seven days, hearts began to soften, actually. So instead of killing, when they finally met, they began repenting and confessing and forgiving. So that in Genesis 31, verse 54, it says that Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his kinsmen to a meal. And they ate the meal. They broke the bread and they poured the wine and spent the night on that mountain. And early in the morning, Laban arose and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them, and he left. So this time, the meal, the breaking of the bread and the pouring of the wine, spoke to reconciliation of a relationship. The war is over. The result is joy. You don't have to be afraid. Third story, Luke 15. Another meal, another example of breaking the bread and pouring the wine, It speaks to reconciliation, to forgiveness, and to grace. The prodigal son has returned. One of the parables that we will deal with in weeks to come. And when the prodigal son came home, the father, you may remember, did three things. Number one, he put a robe on his back. He put a ring on his finger and he killed the fetid calf, saying in Luke 15, 23, Let us eat and be merry. We will break the bread and we will pour the wine. Why? Verse 24 of Luke 15, here's why. Because this son of mine who was dead has come to life. And the son of mine who was lost has now been found. Why do we break the bread and pour the wine? Because the conflict is over. The peace is secure. The relationship is restored. Blessing has come. So relax, enjoy, and save your home. So they ate their meal with gladness, and they broke the bread, and they poured the wine. In fact, even today, we've talked about this before, between Bedouin tribes and in Arab communities in the Middle East, they still practice what's referred to as a sukkah. The reconciliation meal is what that is, where two warring factions will come together in the context of a meal. And in the context of that meal, confession is made, And repentance says, well, recompense is negotiated and a price is paid. And all of that is sealed with a meal where the bread is broken and the wine is poured. And they eat it with gladness for joy because the war is over. The peace is made. Relax. Enjoy. It's safe. You're home. Fourth story. John's Gospel, the 21st chapter, the 12th verse. The resurrected Christ on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. You know this scene, I think. Sharing a meal, there we go again, with his disciples. And all of his disciples are there, including Peter. And Peter hadn't been with Jesus since his time of denial and failure as a friend. Jesus finally, in this scene, gets Peter alone and asks him one question three times. Peter, do you love me? And three times Peter responds saying, you know I do. Then feed my sheep, Jesus finally says. And I want to be careful not to make too big a thing out of that, but it is a little weird because he doesn't say, and he could have said, teach my sheep or lead my sheep or watch my sheep because they need to be taught and led and watched. He says, feed them. Why? Well, there's a real serious food fixation in the Bible. That's why. No. No, I think you know why. It's the meaning of the meal. Because when you break the bread and when you pour the wine, it means the war is over. Price is paid. Peace is made. Relax, Peter. Enjoy. It's safe. You're home. This breaking of the bread and the pouring of the wine is about grace and mercy, repentance and reconciliation. So Peter, when he says, go feed my sheep, what he's saying is, go now, Peter, and give this kind of food, this kind of bread and wine, this very same thing that you have been given, this food and wine of amazing grace that brought you back to life. Go give all that away. Go feed my sheep with bread and wine, with reconciliation and grace and mercy. Give them a steady diet of that. Last story brings us right to this. Last picture, Matthew 26, where Jesus, celebrating for the last time on earth the Passover meal, came to the place where you take the bread and he broke it. like you do. And when he broke the bread and poured the wine, this time he said this extraordinary thing. I am the bread. And I am the wine. Indeed, I am the meal. And the meaning of the meal is simply this. War's over. Peace is made. The price is paid. It's safe. Relax. enjoy your home so come and break the bread and pour the wine end of the book of Revelation says and the spirit and the bride say come and let him who hears say come and whoever is thirsty and whoever is hungry come to this breaking of bread and wine it's fascinating to me that one of the last verses in the Bible, that little verse I gave you is at the end of Revelation, one of the last verses in the Bible where it says the Spirit and the bride say, come, it's as if God is saying, let me say this one more time. Come. Because the bread has already been broken and the wine has already been poured. Let's go to the table. Thank you.
