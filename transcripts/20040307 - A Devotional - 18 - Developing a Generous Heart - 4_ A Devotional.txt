In what we've been referring to for several months now is a journey of the heart. We have been dealing of late with the generous heart of David, which manifested in a variety of ways as we've seen over the last several weeks, but it culminated actually in 1 Chronicles 29, with the generous giving, with David's generous giving of his physical resources, his silver and his gold, to the building of the temple near the end of his life. and the significance of this happening at the end of his life as we told all of these stories of David's generosity over several weeks was that it was very clear that generosity was something that marked his life from the beginning to finally here in the gathering of the offering for the temple at the end of his life. And all of this giving around the temple resulted in two spontaneous responses. Number one was joy. 1 Chronicles 29 verse 9. Then the people rejoiced because they had given so willingly, for they made their offering to the Lord with a whole heart. See, it wasn't just David who was generous, but at the end of his life, the people of God had become generous as well. They had the same heart as the king, and the result was that they rejoiced. Verse 22, so they ate and drank that day, the day that they had given generously. They ate and drank that day before the Lord with great gladness of heart. Second response to this generous giving on their part was worship. Same chapter, 10th verse. So David blessed the Lord in the sight of all the assembly. And David said, Blessed art thou, O Lord, God of Israel, our Father. Verse 13. Now therefore, our God, we thank thee and praise thy glorious name. For what? What were they praising God's glorious name for? Well, it turns out they were praising God for the capacity that God had given them to be generous in their giving. Verse 14 says exactly that. For who am I, David said, and who are my people? that we should be able to give as generously as this, for all things come from thee, and from thy hand we have given back to thee. The paraphrase of that verse is, David's kind of saying, it's kind of weird, God, because we're giving you this stuff, but all this stuff is yours. Verse 16 says the same thing. All this abundance that we have provided to build the house for thy holy name, it's all from thy hand. All of it is yours. Two things we noted last time as marking the generous giving of David and his people in 1 Chronicles 29, this episode of giving. Number one thing we noted was a perspective on all of their parts relative to their physical resources that said basically this. You know what, God? It's not our stuff. And the second thing that marked this that we noted was this issue of joy, which raised for us the question of the day that we began to deal with last week. The question was this, what kind of things can hinder us? What kind of heart conditions might prevent us from embracing this perspective that says it's not my stuff, from experiencing this kind of joy? So far we've identified four things that can do that. Among them are these, an unbelieving heart can hinder you from embracing this perspective, experiencing this joy. Another thing that can do the same is a religious, pharisaic, legalistic heart. So can a forgetful heart. So can a divided heart. A divided heart. Identified by Jesus in both Matthew 6 and Luke 16 when he said, you guys, don't kid yourself. You cannot serve two masters. It can't be done. For either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will hold to the one and despise the other. What I'm really talking about here, said Jesus, is this. You cannot serve God and mammon at the same time. And if you try to live with a divided heart that way, it will shrink your heart. It will steal your joy. You will lose your perspective. And whether you like it or not, or think you won't or not, if you move that way, you will lose your perspective and begin to think it really is my stuff. Mammon, you may recall, and need to remember the grip of mammon is bigger, I think, than we think. That's why we need to remember mammon. We identified it last week as being more than money. It certainly involves money, but it is more than physical coinage. Mammon we identified as a spiritual force behind money, literally a rival God that you have to choose between serving God and mammon. Mammon whose job it is, this spiritual force behind money, whose job it is to seduce us into believing that in money there is life and joy and security and peace, and then to believing that, pursue that money, attach yourself to that money, as if it really did have the power to give you life and joy and security and peace, which obviously, if you believe that, is going to hinder you from embracing this perspective that says it's not my stuff, from experiencing this joy, which then simply raised another question that we dealt with last week. It was this. How is this grip of mammon that all of us are affected by, that has the power to change our perspective, steal our joy, shrink our heart? How is this grip broken in our lives? Now, if you were with us last week, this is the part of our time together. This is the part of the teaching we brought last week that I'm quite sure you remember. Because we actually did together as a group of people, as a body last Sunday. we did together what it takes to break the grip of mammon, and what it takes is this, a kind of practiced discipline around three things where on a regular basis we, number one, redirect our vision, number two, remember our Lord, number three, release our stuff. That was a little three-point outline. But last week at the end of the service, in the context of worship, we did those three things. we remember that at the end of the service we first of all redirected our goal our gaze our vision what we were looking at from the brightness of the gold to the glory of God and we simply did that by worshiping God and in the worship of God you redirect you begin to look at a different thing you begin to look at the glory of God remember the picture we got last week from Milton in his book paradise lost of mammon it's an important picture I'll never forget it it's It's a picture that has personified Mammon as an angel, and that's what Milton does in his book. An angel who, even before the fall, was the least upright of all the angels. For even when Mammon was in the presence of God, before the demonic hordes followed Satan in his rebellion against God, even then, the angel Mammonos studied the gold of the streets, looked down here, looking at the gold, more than the glory of God. And this picture in analogy and symbol was in heaven, and he's in the presence of God. But Mammonos, in this fictionalized picture of him as a spirit, is looking and is fixated on the gold missing entirely, the glory of God. So you want to break the grip of Mammon? Redirect your gaze. Regularly, routinely, in worship, in your time in the word, in your reflection, in meditation and prayer, regularly, routinely, figure out ways to turn your eyes upon Jesus. We sang the song last week, look full in his wonderful face, and the things of earth grow strangely dim, and the light of his glory and grace, see, when our eyes become fixated on the gold, which they do. This is where we live, when they become fixated on the gold. We don't break the fixation by having someone yell at us. The fixation is broken when something brighter and better has the power to pull us away, has the power to attract us, and brighter and better far than the gold is the glory of God. So what do you do, people of God? Regularly, routinely, in a disciplined way, enter into worship, enter into the Word, be in prayer where you turn your eyes. We did that. A sweet time of worship at the end of the sermon. But we looked up, redirected our gaze. And in the very doing of that, we entered into the second thing you need to do to begin, to just begin to loosen the grip of mammon on our hearts. The second thing is we remembered the grace, the extravagant generosity of our Lord Jesus Christ, who though he was rich, 2 Corinthians 8, 9, yet for our sakes he became poor. What does it mean he became poor? means this, that he emptied himself, Philippians 2, of all the rights and privileges that belonged to him as God, and taking on the form of a slave, he became obedient unto death, even death on the cross, in order that we, through his poverty, through his extravagant generosity, giving of himself, we might be made rich, we might be redeemed, we might be reclaimed for God. He gave everything he had. We need to remember that. and when we do the group of mammon that would pull us downward begins to loosen as we redirect our gaze to the glory of God as we remember the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ toward us in fact remembering is part of what this table we're about to partake in is all about do this in remembrance of me in the series on generosity this issue of remembering has been a major theme for one of the things we've been saying over and over is this, that generosity, a generous heart, begins with a gratitude that remembers what? That we had a debt we couldn't pay. And Jesus paid it all. And when you forget that, generosity dries up. Generosity begins with a gratitude that remembers that at one time we were separate from Christ, excluded from the community of faith, having no hope and without God in the world. But now, we who were formerly far off, had no hope without God in the world, have been brought near by what? The blood of Christ, which means he gave everything he had. Generosity begins with a gratitude that remembers the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the extravagant generosity of our Lord Jesus Christ. But if it stops there, as wonderful and as powerful as those two things together are, to begin to break the grip of mammon, redirecting our gaze, remembering his grace and his generosity. The third thing that's necessary, if it stops there, it can dissolve into nothing but a sentimental blob of goo. That's why the third thing it takes to break the grip of mammon in conjunction with the first two is this. We need to release our grip. On what? Our stuff. which means to give. For there is one act, said Richard Swenson, above all, it has the power to break the grip of mammon by going against the law of mammon, the law of money even. An act for which money is not made, that act is giving. Well, last week, you know, if you were here, it was a powerful thing. At the end of the service, we did all three of those things in worship. we redirected our gaze and we remembered the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and then we released our resources as we walked out the door. Remember that? Kind of took an offering, had buckets at the door. Encourage you to give, believing that this really was a corporate way to symbolically and really break things. And then it came with this promise that as we were encouraging you to enter into this discipline of redirecting your gaze, remembering the grace of our Lord and releasing your stuff, that as a church, We needed to, this needed to be congruent. So whatever it was that you were going to release, we were going to release as well and give whatever was given away as quickly as we could. Well, Monday morning, about nine o'clock, I got a call from Jean McCauley. And she was over here at church and she said, Dave, you gotta come over. You gotta grab Bonnie and come over here and look at this. And I knew that Jean was one of the women who count the money on Mondays. And I said, well, do you have a total? and I assumed she was talking about that second offering. I said, do you have a total now already? And she goes, no, Dave, we're not done counting yet, but it's not even about the amount. You've got to see this. So Bonnie and I came over, and we walked into the room with the four women who were counting the money, Gene and Leslie and Pam and Viv, who with gladness of heart. They had these sappy smiles on her face. I'm not making fun of them, believe me. They were sweet smiles. They were about to cry. Just look at this, they said. Boxes of money. But it wasn't just money, you guys. There were cards and notes. There was jewelry, necklaces with crosses, personal checks that were written out to someone and they would sign it over to the church. What obviously, and you really did need to see it, and what I saw was something that all of us concurred. Obviously, what you did was you just kind of took whatever you had, and you gave everything you had. You can tell, people just reached in their pockets. I don't have any money. What do I have? And they gave their earrings, or they gave their necklace. They just released something. And then we all went out to lunch and had a great, great lunch. It was great on you. you know i'm kidding i mean that was an overwhelming sense that this was a this this this was a holy thing can you imagine touching that money for anything that was that that was anything other than what it was marked for now you know what as i reflect on that and as we as a church reflect on that experience and whatever it felt like for you, I really believe, I don't know all of what is going to come from that. But I do believe, I see things like this in the kingdom where you can have an event happen, and there's the event, and it's nice, but these things ripple out. And I really believe this thing is going to ripple out in ways that we can't even discern right now. And while there's a lot of things that I don't know about where it's going to go, I do know this, that Mammon's grip got a little looser in some of you. It's getting a little looser in us as we get called into deeper places in the kingdom of God. So now we come to the table with all of that in mind. A wonderful place, I believe, to write in the middle of the series on a generous heart to kind of stop, pause, and at the table hear and experience the realities of a generous heart because the table, beloved, just think of it with me, and the elements thereupon speak eloquently. Maybe as eloquently as anything we could think of symbolically, they speak eloquently to the extravagant generosity of God who gave everything he had in a few moments. We will take the bread, which is a symbol of his body, which was what? Broken. He gave everything. He had. And then we will see the cup and take the bread and dip it into the cup and the cup is a symbol of the blood that he poured out and again the symbol, the message is again the same. He gave everything. He had. But also from this table as you hear that and it's not hard to hear that we can see that and in a few moments we're even going to put a cross here and that cross speaks to the extravagant generosity of God as well. You can consider the cross, but I want you to hear something else coming from the table. Not just the extravagant generosity of God, but here, listen for this. In addition to the extravagant generosity of God, listen for a call to be coming from the table. To be what? to be the same as him. Listen for a call to be generous as well. Another story that speaks to generosity and how I think we're learning this and moving in this in ways we've not known before that came out of last week, another story that came out of last week had to do with our general offering. We had the one at the end and that was exciting and obviously something that the Spirit of God had moved us to do. But I think, you know, we took our normal offering last week in the normal way before a sermon, before any pleas to be generous. We just took our offering in the time we normally do it. I think you're also aware, if you're aware of what's going on in our church, that for a period of time we've been struggling with our finances and just averaging for several months in a row about $10,000 a week less than what we need. And that pattern is creating some issues that we're going to be dealing with and are in the process of dealing with and addressing in a variety of ways that you will know more and more about as time goes on. But in the middle of all that, the offering last week, and by the way, we need, if you look at the bulletin, we need $100,000 a week. That's a lot of money. $10,000 average short. Last week, before any appeal to give, the giving that was released in this place was $150,000. Just like, like, like, like the breath of God, like something of mammon's grip is being released. We're fixed. We're better. I don't think that. I think there's some powerful symbolism there. I think it stands at least this way as a symbol of what I would call rightly ordered generosity when I consider the general fund giving and then the giving that was done at the door. Rightly ordered generosity, rightly ordered giving would be marked by two things. Number one, a family that first of all takes care of its own needs, but not in an extravagant, we're going to just devour this all ourselves. At the same time, we're mindful of our need to take care of the family. At the same time, we're giving away. I mean, if a family, for instance, a physical family, not a church family, just a physical family, decide, well, you know, you're going to starve, and we're not going to do it, but I'm going to be the hero out here and give this all away. There's some problems with that. In fact, the Bible says the person who doesn't care for his own family is worse than an infidel. You take care of your family and you don't wait for everything to be lined up before you give. At the same time, you're meeting the needs of the family, you give things away. Last week, we had the offering that we had to take care of the family, the church family. We had the offering that we had that went out beyond our doors, a symbol of rightly ordered generosity. See, we did both of those things in abundance. It speaks to a season of abundance in giving away what God has given us to give. So this morning, when you come to the table, see if you can hear several things. Number one, listen for, watch for. It's not hard to hear or see the extravagant generosity of God. But listen, please be careful to listen. a call to be the same as him, extravagantly generous. One other thing I want you to listen for as you come to the table, an invitation to come. You know, these last several weeks, we've told many stories of David's generosity that manifested in a variety of ways. Among my favorites is the generosity he showed to Mephibosheth because the story of David's generosity to Mephibosheth embodies the essential ingredients of the gospel and also this invitation to come to the table. Remember Mephibosheth? Living in a land far away from the king, because he lived far away from the king, he didn't know the heart of the king, the king now being David. Excuse me. And he never heard the voice of the king, so he didn't really know him. He'd heard rumors about the king. Some said he was full of grace. Some said he was a big bad guy. So when the king came looking for Mephibosheth, saying, I know where you live, I know your name, I want you to come to me, Mephibosheth didn't know what to expect, so he was afraid. First words out of David the king's mouth to Mephibosheth became for us, in the teaching we did, became for us the very words of God to all the Mephibosheths of the world. For the Mephibosheths of the world are the lost humanity, men and women who since the fall, theologically, if you want to get the big picture, have been living in a land far away from the king. They do not know his heart. They do not know his voice. They've heard conflicting rumors. Some say he's full of grace. Some say he's a mean old guy. But to the Mephibosheths of the world, you need to understand he's looking for you, and he wants you back. First words of David to Mephibosheth, who was afraid of him, were these words, 2 Samuel 9, verse 7. I know you've heard conflicting reports about me, but here's the truth. I will surely show kindness to you. My intentions toward you are good. I will restore to you all that you have lost. I invite you to my table, Mephibosheth. I will include you in my family. So come and eat the bread and drink the wine and you will come to life. So Mephibosheth, 2 Samuel 9 says, ate at the table of the king as a son for the rest of his days and so can you. I don't know if there are any Mephibosheths among us. I can't imagine there aren't some. just in a gathering this size. And I want to speak just a word, and I even want to intentionally calm down and get less and less preachy as I say it. If you are a Mephibosheth, you know who you are, and maybe you would even say this of yourself, I'm living in a land far away from the king. May not even have a tremendous amount of desire to know much about the king, except you're here, and that's a little curious. Because you've been living in a land far away from the king, you don't know his heart, and you've never heard his voice. And you're not sure of his intentions, you hear conflicting reports. I'm here to tell you that I do know the heart of the king, and I have heard his voice. And this is what he is saying to you, Mephibosheth. I will show kindness to you. My intentions are good. I will restore to you everything that you have lost. I invite you to my table. I will include you in my family. So come and eat the bread and drink the wine and you will come to life. As we go to the table, I want you to hear at the table the extravagant generosity of God. I want you to hear a call to become the same way. And if you're Mephibosheth, I want you to hear an invitation to come to the table. In a moment, we're gonna put a cross here. Maybe before you go to the table, it would be better to come to the cross and wonder about what it means. Maybe it'd be even better to come to someone here who could pray with you and pray for you. And you could come with a question like this. I'd like to go to that table that he's talking about. I'd like to be a son. I'd like to be a daughter of the king. And sometimes we need help coming to the table. Maybe you could poke the friend next to you and just say, I'm a mashivafafith, whatever that guy said. And I want to come to the table. Would you bring me to the table? What do you have to do? Want to. Want to come to the table of the king. You need to want to come into life in the kingdom of God that's provided for us by authentic relationship with God through Christ. You could spend the rest of your days at the table of a king as a son, as a daughter. So what do you say we go to the table? And as we go, let's see if we can hear and see the extravagant generosity of God. Do not let it be lost on you. Don't let it become this little ritual we do. Take the bread, dip it in the wine. Extravagant generosity of God, thank you. But as you do that, let's see if we can hear the call to be the same and the invitation to come. I'm going to ask the communion stewards to gather and meet me down on the floor and we're going to have just a word of prayer and then go to the table let's pray together as we reflect on and bless these elements. Father, as I hold these in my hand, the bread, which is a symbol of your body broken, and the cup, which is a symbol of your blood outpoured, we do say to you now, we hear the message. We hear the message coming from the table, and the message is this extravagant generosity, and we are grateful. we thank you Jesus that you gave everything you had but father as we come to this table we would not be people who presume to just take and take but father we come with hearts that say lord help us hear the call to be the same way to give what you have given us to share the life that you've infused us with, to become a people marked by extravagant generosity of time and talent and all our treasure. And Father, we pray too for the Mephibosheths among us that coming from this table, from these objects, they would hear the invitation that David extended to Mephibosheth that you extend to us to come and eat the bread and drink the wine as a son, as a daughter and pray for that miracle of new life that could be brought to bear in this very room at this very time. In Jesus' name, we bless these elements and our partaking of them. Amen. Amen.
