Thank you so much, Keith. It's wonderful to be here again. The last time I saw you, it was in a gymnasium. And this is a different setting, much nicer. I'm sorry I couldn't be here this morning. I teach late on Wednesday. And so my only option would have been to do a red eye, and that's a wipeout. And so I'm glad to be here, and I'm sorry I missed Todd, but we will catch up and converge, I'm sure, as we go along. Now, I think you have an outline and a title for the session. Is that true? Yeah, okay. The title of this session, I will inform you. You got the title. I hope the title is The Kingdom as Reality. That's it. And I wanted to preface my remarks by just saying the reason that Todd and I go about trying to do what we do is because we are so convinced that what we're talking about really works. And let me translate that this way, that all of the highest aspirations that you would pick up for your life, reading the Scriptures, the New Testament, the Sermon on the Mount, 1 Corinthians 13, 1 John 4, whatever that is, see, that is available to us. And it's available to us very simply by starting where we are. Right where we are. I mean who we are. I don't have to be someone else to approach the kingdom of God and begin to step into all the wonderful things that are described in the Scriptures about Jesus and about others who are following Him. That's for today. That's for us. right where we are, right who we are. And now for some reason, that hasn't been obvious. Would you agree with me that that hasn't been obvious? I mean, I began to realize some years ago, after I'd been preaching for a long time, and I'm not sure how much preaching helps the preacher because we're so oriented towards getting something done, basically managing to get out alive in some circumstances. But I began to realize I was reading these wonderful passages, like Ephesians 4 is one of my favorite passages, just absolutely transcendently beautiful about what life could be. And I began to realize I'm not thinking of that as something that I step into. I'm thinking of it maybe as something that was nice for Paul, or maybe he didn't do it either. Because the picture that I had absorbed as a young person, and I've been in church ever since I was born, okay? And I'm thankful for that. But the picture I absorbed was that somehow these are wonderful distant ideals. That when you talk about loving your enemy, I mean that's a good one to illustrate. Maybe we'll come back to that because in this time together I do want to spend some time just talking explicitly about particular things. like loving your enemy. And suppose you decided to do that. What's the next thing you would do? Now what I'm saying is that the way I was brought up, and I'm not blaming anyone because these were wonderful people. I still can't really, I think, adequately appreciate how much Christ was a part of their lives. But it wasn't a part of their lives to say, well, we just do that. And to say, well, if I fail, then I have to learn how to do it. I have to learn how to do it. So then instead of just saying, well, that's a wonderful distant idea. Love your enemies. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wonderful. You say, I must learn how to do that. And you've probably heard me say or read how I talk about this often. And it just turns out there aren't many churches that are in that business of teaching you how to love your neighbor. I was in Ireland a few months back, and we had a wonderful meeting with really devout folks, really in the harness. And they had been reading what I had been saying, and this church we met in actually had done something that I've suggested, which is they put on the front of their bulletin and in their literature, they put, we teach people to do the things that Jesus said. I'm going to be ragging you about that later on. But, now there were people there from many churches, and I had talked about what Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount, and including loving your enemy. Now folks, you know there, they have people who are really their enemies, because they've tried to kill them, and they've succeeded. You know how it is in Ireland on that. They were in a period of peace, but one man stood and said, I just don't know about loving your enemies. I don't know if we can do that. And instead of trying to convince him that he could, I ask him a question. Are any of the churches teaching people how to do that? And this was a moment of really deep searching, and there was a silence in the room. Most of these were pastors and pastors' families. And after a while, he said no. Now, when we want to talk about kingdom living, we're talking about a life of learning, a life of learning how you live in the kingdom of God. and if we get that point then my statement that everything in there is accessible to everyone that's what I hope we can understand you might want to think in your in your the quietness of your mind right now. What are the things you would like to accomplish that is in there but you haven't accomplished? Or you feel you haven't. Sometimes people think they haven't and they have because they've been taught in a way that they're not supposed to do it. And so it's like the common thing among Christians that if you're humble, you shouldn't say it. Funny, isn't it, you know? Why can't you say it? Because if you are humble, you would be actually immune to whatever bad effects there might be of saying it. Isn't that true? Now, of course, you wouldn't say it in a bragging way. Right? Because you are humble. But you don't have to lie about it just because you're humble. So now, that's really important for our starting point. Because I'm hoping you're really going to take this all practically. And if you do, I know you've been making a lot of progress because I talk to people about you. And actually, more than any other church in America, I refer to you when people say, well, how about some place where they're actually doing some of the stuff you talk about? And I know that you are. But I want to be very practical. And if I can enlist you for the three days that we have together, It will help what we want to do if you would meditatively read a short passage in Paul's writings. And that would be Colossians 3, 1 through 17. Now, I said meditatively read because I thought if I said memorize, you might say, oh, I can't do that. But you can. And it's a wonderful blessing. And if you feel like you don't want to try to memorize it, try to, say, read it three times a day. And you can start at the break in a little while and just read it through. Now here's what it says. If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Hey, that's the kingdom of God. Seek those things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth. Because you're dead and your life is hid with Christ and God. you see how that you're being repositioned now and your unity with Christ see being saved is really a matter of being caught up in what Christ is now doing on earth that's what being saved is it's being caught up in what Christ is now doing on earth you say well what about when I die. Don't worry about that. Actually, maybe you won't. Actually, Jesus said you wouldn't. Do you remember that? I'm going to preach at you on Sunday about that, so you can brace yourself for that. And actually, you're not going to die because your death is already in the past. And that's what Paul says, for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God. Now, you don't even get to know who you are now. But when Christ who is our life shall appear, then you will also appear with Him glorious. You are a glorious being. I can't say that in many churches because they'll think you're new age. Right? It's better than the new age ever dreamed. Because to get to be God on the New Age story, you have to stop being you. You know that. Because on the New Age story, you're everybody else. That's true. Right? That's how you get to find out you're God, is that you aren't anybody. Now, Jesus and Paul have got a much better thing going here. See, they understand that you get to be you and also glorious and also not God. Now, that's a load off your back right there, isn't it? Being God is tough. I'm glad God is the one who is, because He can handle it. So now, once you get who you are, then Paul goes on there and says, mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth. Your members that are upon the earth are not your hands and your feet. Your members that are upon the earth are the things you can do without God. And he gives you a little list there. Adultery, fornication, desire out of balance, and desires that are just wrong. Now, the old English version, I love it. Evil concupiscence. You know, you read the King James, evil concupiscence. Man, that makes you want to bail out on that one real fast. But it just means desires that you got desires out of balance and then you got desires you just shouldn't have. And those are things you can do without God. And that's why he calls them your members which are upon the earth. And then he goes on and lists covetousness. For goodness sakes. And he says it is idolatry. For which things sake the wrath of God comes upon the children of disobedience. In which you also sometimes walked when you lived in them. But now you also put aside all of these. Anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy. Filthy communication out of your mouth. Lie not one to another seeing you have put off the old man with his deeds. And have put on the new person that is renewed in knowledge. After the likeness of him that created him. In which there is no Greek nor Jew. No circumcision, no uncircumcision. No barbarian, no Scythian, no bond, no free, but Christ is all in all. Put on, therefore, as the elect of God, bowels of mercies. Bowels means what you live from. It means renew your insides, because that's where your life comes from. Put on, therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humility of mind. long-suffering, which is patience. You know, that's the same thing as you get in 1 Corinthians 13. And you have to understand that so many times you have a description, looks a little different, but it's the same thing because the New Testament isn't giving you laws. It's depicting a life. Meekness. So, put on insides of kindness, mercies, kindness, humility of mind. And you know, humility of mind, Keith, that's one of the hardest things to get around a university. And it's a primary affliction of these places that we all have to deal with now. But humility of mind, long-suffering, or patience, and meekness. And above all these things, now, all of these, every time you get one of these long progressions in the Scriptures, it always winds up with agape. And there in 1 Corinthians 3, above all these things, put on agape, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your heart, to which you're also called in one body. Peace is not just a little thing in you. You've got peace. It seeps out. Right? So let the peace of God rule in your heart, to which you're also called in one body. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. No rap music. I don't know. You might try to edify someone by giving them that da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, but I don't think it'll work. Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. Singing with grace in your hearts unto the Lord. And then the grand culmination there, verse 17. Whatever you do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father through Him. Now, doing what you do in the name of the Lord Jesus means that you do it on His behalf and on His power. That's what it means. Whatever you do in word or deed, there are going to be a lot of things you're not going to do if you do it this way. So that's going to save you a lot of trouble right there. Because if you try to do some things in His name, He backs out. Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. So that's Colossians 3, 1 through 17. And I think it will just help what Todd and I are trying to do here. If you will, give that a meditative reading two or three times a day. Try a little memorization. I'm sure you can do those first four verses. And they are really glorious. They are really glorious. And they tie in with a lot of things that we're going to be talking about. Now, kingdom. Because you see, all of this stuff comes true for us as we live in the kingdom of God. But Jesus' invitation to us is to come with him in the kingdom of God. Live in the kingdom of God with him. And once you begin to get that idea, you see it a lot of other places. Like, for example, the 23rd Psalm. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. I'll not lack for anything. Now, does that sound good? Yeah, okay. Well, what about Matthew 6.33? Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and what? Good. Now let's see how many of you know Joshua 1.8. Does anyone know Joshua 1.8? Good. This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate therein day and night that you may observe to do according to everything that is written therein. Then you will make your way prosperous and you will have good success. That's the open secret of the kingdom. And one of the ways you can say how you find the kingdom is to love the law. And I know it's hard to even hear that because we're such an antinomian society and we think law is bad and repressive and all of that. But let me tell you, the law is one of the best ways that you can find the kingdom of God if you will receive it by grace. See, law is not opposed to grace. Law is a manifestation of grace. And that's why, in the restoration of the soul, the law has a primary part. The 23rd Psalm says, you restore my soul. and that's God's part. And He's involved in all of this, of course, because living in the kingdom just means that we're walking with Him. That means we sense, acknowledge, welcome, invoke, count on His presence in everything we do. Right? But now remember Psalm 19. I think it's 19.7. the law of the Lord is perfect. Can you finish the verse? Restoring the soul. The law restores the soul. You have a broken soul, unless it has been healed, and I trust it has. You have a broken soul, and one of the ways that you restore it is to bring it in harmony with the kingdom of God by following the law. But you have to love the law or it'll kill you. That means you see the goodness of God in the law. Now, that's why Jesus said He didn't come to destroy the law. You remember He said that in Matthew 5. He's given the Beatitudes, which are a totally different picture of life. So much so that, I mean, he comes down saying things like, you are the salt of the earth, you are the light of the world. And you have to remember that group he was talking to. Looked like a Benny Hinn audience. I mean, these are needy people that he's talking to, and he's saying to them, you are the salt. Well, I mean, read the description at the end of Matthew 4. It describes them. Even lunatics, it says. We don't have lunatics in church. But that's why Jesus had to go out in the hills so the lunatics could come. He's saying to these people, you're the salt of the earth, you're the light of the world. And you can understand then why he would have to head them off. Now, when you say something like, don't think that I've come to destroy the law, what's happening? People are thinking that, right? That's why he said, don't think that. I am come to fulfill the law. See, the law is fulfilled by the grace of life for those who are living with confidence in Jesus and his kingdom. See, if you want to fulfill the law, you don't try to fulfill the law. You try to become the kind of person who would naturally do the things that the law says. Right? That's how you keep the law. That's the story of grace. That's the story of the kingdom. And so when Jesus comes, he has one message. Actually, John the Baptist performs his function by giving the same message before Jesus came into his public life. We look at Matthew 4.17. After John was put in prison, then Jesus comes, and what is he preaching? Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens is at hand. Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens is at hand. Now, what he's announcing is the shocking fact that anyone can come. that you don't have to stand on the proprieties of the law or of the social institution that had grown up around it. You don't have to do that. You just come. It's at hand. To say it's at hand means that it's now available. If I had not been here before and I was coming in and maybe Dave or someone was bringing me along here, he might say, well, turn for the sanctuary is at hand. My goodness, am I up there? Now I'll be self-conscious. So he might say, turn for the sanctuary is at hand. All right. That's what that verse means. It means just step into it. It's here. It's not that it's about to come and it's not here yet. So I saw on one of the papers at the door, kingdom now. Yes, kingdom now. Actually, the kingdom of God is from everlasting to everlasting. There has never not been a kingdom of God. Never. What was new was access to it. God has had this problem with human beings because of the particular objective that he has for them. His greatest difficulty, if you forgive me speaking that way, his greatest difficulty is to relate to human beings without just blotting them out. And you remember how in the Scripture over and over when people would have a theophany or see something that seemed like God, they would say, we're dead. Right? And there's the saying, no man can see God and live. That's biblical. And when you realize how great God is, you can understand that. We have to keep the sun 90 million miles away from us to live with it. But our son is nothing compared to God. I mean, the energy in God is so great that it dwarfs everything in the universe. So you have to be careful with that. So God has a problem. So he came into human history and called a fellow by the name of Abraham out and started a family that grew into a nation and a culture, and that is what we would call Jewish culture today. But he was not going to stop there, and in fact, he called Israel to reach the world. And you read the prophets and you see how over and over, and of course that's how it happened. I mean, why does Jonah go to Nineveh? Because God loves Nineveh. And that's what the Jews were supposed to do. They were supposed to be the light of the world. no, I'm cutting a lot of corners here, but actually that's not going to be frustrated. And when you see Jesus come on the scene and you see Him preaching and teaching and leading people into the kingdom of God and giving them the kind of life that everyone's heart really hungers for and meeting their needs and far beyond their needs. But as Paul says in Ephesians 3, He is able to do abundantly, exceedingly above all that we can ask or think by His power that is at work within us. You see, that's the great engine of God, but it's in a person. And then it comes to you, and it comes to me. And now it's safe. It's the difference between setting off a bomb, an atomic bomb, and using atomic energy to come down the little wires and through the roof and into the light and give us light. See, that human life was meant to percolate with that divine energy, which is God present. It's not an energy in a non-personal sense. It's God present in human life. And so that's where we come down to Colossians 3.17. Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father through him. See, that's that wonderful energy that Paul is talking about in Ephesians 3. He can do exceedingly, abundantly above. Now then, that's for the world. That's not just for one ethnic group. Over and over, it has fallen into the hands of one group that wanted to monopolize it and own it. but the drive is to all kinds of people. And so when Jesus comes preaching the kingdom, what he is preaching is the availability of God's rule to everyone. And that's what's distinctive about it. And you look at the stories in the Gospels, what do you see? You see the people who are not supposed to be able to come in being brought in. So right after the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew, you have a little leper. Now that leper had heard Jesus and watched him. It isn't like living in Minneapolis where you don't see people very much. You don't know who they are if you do see them. I mean, this little man had heard Jesus. He knew about Jesus. Everyone knew about Jesus. And so now here he comes in Matthew 8. And, of course, lepers, if there's anything you know about lepers, they're not supposed to be coming. They're supposed to be going. But he had heard Jesus preach and teach. And so he came and he said, Master or teacher, if you will, you can heal me. And, you know, you can almost hear under his breath, not that you would, but if you would, you could do that. See, because he's operating on the system of values that Jesus was inverting when he taught the kingdom. Jesus could just as well have said, blessed are the lepers. Do you understand that? Because what he's working with is people who are shut out and he's bringing them in. That's the meaning of his saying repeated in various ways, often through the Gospels, the last shall be first and the first shall be last. That is, the last in the human order may be first in the kingdom of...that's open to them. And the first in the human order may be last. Right? And you get that clearly in the Lukean version of those in Luke 6. He could have just as well said, blessed are the lepers. Not because they're lepers, but because the kingdom of God is available to them. And so the little man comes, typical generosity of Jesus. I don't think he touched him like you'd touch a hot stove. You know, I think he put his arm around him. That's what the fellow had been needing because that just wasn't done. And he said, I will be healed. And the power of the kingdom of God moved in that man and rearranged the molecules, and he didn't have leprosy anymore. That's the kingdom of God. Now, I think you folks know your Bibles, and now you just think about all the stories in the Gospels where that sort of thing happened. Here comes a Roman centurion. could you say blessed are Roman centurions well not if you didn't want to you want to have your flak jacket on in that time if you said that but Jesus could say that here's a little woman with an issue of blood 12 years isn't that right 12 years spent all of her money her insurance ran out and she was no better here's a woman who makes her living by prostitution coming in where he's eating see that's the openness of the kingdom of god and when jesus was saying repent for the kingdom of the heavens his hand he's not saying get down and beat your head on the floor that isn't exactly what repentance is though if you repent you may want to do that anyway because repent means that you think about how you've been thinking. And you see how dumb it is and especially how dumb it is with this new fact that now Jesus is here because the kingdom was present in Jesus. And in Jesus it's stepped beyond all ethnic boundaries into the cosmic Christ. you know that wonderful passage in John 20 where John is explaining why he wrote the book and he's talking about how he wrote it in order that you might know that Jesus is the Christ see the people who had to deal with Jesus they had a problem figuring out who he was and you remember Jesus put that to his disciples at one point and said who do people say that I am and so they had a little list they went through well I'm one of the prophets Elijah so on see he didn't this was a part of God's strategy and it still is of coming into the world in this person Jesus he didn't run over anybody he came into one of the most obscure corners of one of the most obscure people though in many ways a very advanced people still not an important people and he slips in there aren't you glad Christmas is coming I love Christmas. See, because what Christmas really stands for is the gift of God. You know, oh little town of Bethlehem, how silently, how silently the wondrous gift is given. That's Jesus. See, the kingdom of God is essentially something you have to seek because only in seeking it can you get ready to live there. See, some of you know that about prayers. You start praying about something, and you have to change before you can receive the answer. Because otherwise, possibly, the answer to prayer would just mean you got your way. That would feed your ego. It would be worse than not having an answer at all, probably. You see, the gift of the kingdom comes very silently. Now, that's associated with the fact that the kingdom is spiritual. It's spiritual because basically the kingdom... Hey, look at that. well is God acting. This is the most wonderful thing I have ever seen. I've never had that where you could write here and it would go up there. Isn't that wonderful? The kingdom is God acting. It's God in action. And that's, you know, the greatness of that. Now you just think, I mean, God is acting almost everywhere. There's one little place that he allows someone else to act, and that's in human life. Now this really gets down to the nub of why there is a human history, why there is an earth, why it's lasted this long. I mean, if you know a little bit about earth history, The very idea that there could be a period in which human history could develop is fantastic. We live in a cosmic shooting gallery. And the fact that we haven't been hit in the way that got rid of the dinosaurs, we're told, it should get rid of us. That is divine providence in action. And if you don't believe that, you just get a book on earth history and look at it and on the solar system. You see, God is running that show so that there could be this amazing project of human history in which God, who is loving, creative will, creates loving, creative wills. that's you I'm talking about see that's what you are meant to be is loving creative will and God formed a system call it the earth and in that system he puts human beings and he gives them a job do you remember what the job is? Genesis 1.26 what does it say? let us make man in our likeness and let him have dominion. But here's the way you spell dominion. R-E-S-P-O-N-S-I-B-I-L-I-T-Y. Because what it means is, let them be responsible. And you just read that verse, 26 and 27, and you'll see that. And turn over to Psalm 8, you'll see the same thing. Turn to Hebrews 2, you'll see the same thing. Turn to Revelation 5.22, same thing. He's making people a loving community in which He will primarily dwell in this universe forever. It is a habitation of God. And that is the people of God that are called out of human history. But they have to want it. They have to seek it. Because the kingdom is God acting, but there is another kingdom, you acting. So now what is your kingdom? Well, your kingdom is the range of your effective will. For example, you ladies, whatever you have in your pocketbooks is definitely in your kingdom. Isn't that true? and probably your homes. You guys, what is in your tool shed is probably in your kingdom. Now what is that? It's the range of your effective will. When Jesus, after his death and resurrection, came to give the Great Commission to his followers, he said, the first thing he said, go back to Matthew 28, first thing he said was, I have been given say over everything in heaven and in earth. I've been given authority. See, that's Christ ascended. He poured himself out. He emptied himself, as Philippians 2 says, emptied himself, took on the form of a servant, became obedient even to death, death on the cross. Therefore, God has highly exalted him. See, Jesus could have asserted his kingdom, but he didn't. He said, I do always those things that please the Father. He said that if you don't die, you won't bring life. He said, whosoever shall save his life shall lose it. See, that's someone who says, wow, my kingdom, I'm going to save that. I'm going to save that. So that's your kingdom. So now, what were you supposed to do with this? You're supposed to give it up to his. That's how you could be responsible according to the covenant in Genesis. Let us make man in our image and let him have responsibility for all the living things. He's responsible for the earth. People still behave that way. If some killer whales get trapped in an ice floe in Alaska, what do people say? Let's go get them out! Why do people even feel that way? See, that's the remnants of the image of God in the human being. And actually, there's nothing that human beings won't think about doing. Some of your tax dollars are now being used on grants for people in universities who are trying to figure out how to reforest Mars. Did you know that? It's true. How to control earthquakes in California. Earthquakes? Well, you see, that's what's built into human beings. You watch a little kid. That's why they're into everything. You want to touch it. You want to take it apart, want to make something, want to give it to you. Right? Then they want to take it back. They give it to you again. They like giving. See? Now, basically, what they're doing is they are experiencing their kingdom. And you know, you can teach kingdom stuff to kids faster than anyone else because they're so sensitive to it. They immediately identify, ah, I see, yes, the range of my effective will, what I have say over. There's another one, actually, Satan's kingdom. And this is why Satan was trying to kill Jesus from the start to the finish. I don't know what you thought of Gibson's movie, but I thought one of the most tremendous revelations of the truth in it was after the crucifixion and that great tear falling. was Satan writhing in agony because he had not succeeded in stopping Jesus. But that's what he's about. Now, he can't do too much about Jesus and about God, so he works on us. And he can, unfortunately, do a lot about that. Now, what are we talking about when we say the kingdom is real? What's the real stuff? Let's work on that just a minute, and then I've got to talk about spirit, because the kingdom is spiritual. When we say something is real, what that really means is you can count on it. It's real. You can count on it. And if you're crosswise of it, that means you're going to have to deal with it. So to say the kingdom is real is primarily to say you can count on it. Now, we've already said it won't run over you, at least for now. So you still have to seek it. But you can count on it. And Jesus comes and teaches us and shows us truths about the kingdom of God and invites us in. And we get to know it by counting on it. You see, the organ of spiritual knowledge or the instrument of spiritual knowledge is obedience. Obedience is how you come to know it. And that's really true of most knowledge. You really get it when you're interacting with things. But it's especially important here because, see, if you want to know the reality of the kingdom, you count on it. And that's what we want to understand about temptations. You know, a temptation is your greatest opportunity to know the kingdom. And you understand that temptation is ambiguous as it's used in the Scripture because temptation is sin, but temptations are also trials because trials turn out to be temptations to sin. So James 1 says, Count it all joy when you fall into all kinds of temptations. now practically that's a really good thing to work on and sometimes we do it a little humorously and so on like yeah another joyful temptation but it's actually quite real because if we take those occasions the same way with temptation to sin if we take an occasion where we're tempted to sin as an occasion to know the kingdom, here's what we do. We don't do what we're tempted to do and watch for the hand of God. Now, if you're running your kingdom yourself, you won't be able to do that. Temptation, really, temptation to sin is always a temptation to not trust God. Think of the story of the garden. And basically, Satan worked his kingdom. He was going after Eve and Adam's kingdom. And what he did to get that was get them to mistrust God. And so every temptation that we have, and this is really important for what we'll be talking about later, namely going through the process of learning not to do things that are wrong, Now, every temptation is an occasion when we have the opportunity of saying, well, I won't do that. I will do what is right. Now, that means conform to the law, right? And that's a way of seeking the kingdom. I'd better say that again. Conforming to the law is a way of seeking the kingdom. Now, you can't do it on your own, but you don't have to do it on your own. God will help. But if you turn your back on God, you will never see him acting. So there's a story, no doubt, made up by some preacher about a little girl in Sunday school who has asked what a lie is. And she replies, It's an abomination to God and a very present help in time of trouble. See, and children learn that very early. Isn't that right? And as someone has remarked, you never have to teach them to lie. They figure it out. They figure it out. That's because they're, now then, when you obey, and children have to be taught. You know, not just, don't lie, don't ever lie to me. They have to be taught what a lie is and what the options are. and in our life not just lying but any temptation we have whether it's a trouble or a sin right off that's tempting us those are opportunities to know the kingdom of God and that's why James says count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations and then goes on to explain how you live through now if you don't take them the way James is saying it, then it won't work. But if you take them trusting God, then it will work. So, for example, if you're a kingdom person and you've gotten, got the idea, as it were, and you're ready to go, you will never say something like, well, you know, business is business. See, when do people say that? When they're getting ready to do something they know is wrong. And the answer to that is, well, business is business, but it's never just business. It is business. You have to take care of business. That's an important part of what it means to be responsible, to have dominion under God. And if you run a taco stand or a bank, that's really important work. But you don't want to do it on your own. So you want to do that under God. So you bring your kingdom with your taco stand or your bank. You bring that into the kingdom of God. And you do business in the best possible way. You serve people in your business. You honor God. You make a profit, a decent profit. That's okay. Nothing wrong with that. until you start making it your kingdom, and then everything goes wrong. And then you'll say things like, business is business, because that's all it is to you. So on the other hand, if you say, whatever the issue might be in that situation, you say, I'm going to do what I believe God would have me do, and I'm going to trust His kingdom, and I'm going to... Jesus is going to be with me because He promised to be with me, and He said He had authority over everything in heaven and earth, and that means this taco stand. See? What you're putting yourself in a position to do is really come to know the kingdom of God. Because, I mean, the kingdom of God is this immense power. As Paul says to the Corinthians, if you remember, 1 Corinthians 4, I think it is, the kingdom is not in word, but in power. Now, he knew what that was because he lived in it, right? That was the framework of his existence. That's why he could say things like, for me to live is Christ, to die is gain, because he was so familiar with something that was happening day to day, you see, that he wasn't just whistling through the graveyard when he said that. I mean, he really meant it because his life was involved in it. Again, as he says in 1 Corinthians 5, I think it is, talking about the transition out of this earthly tabernacle to a better one, he says, God has given us the earnest of his spirit. What that meant was that we're now engaged in a life that is not of this world. Spiritual reality is the ultimate reality. Okay, let me give you a concept of spirit to work with. My goodness. Okay, so now, you know, hold on, because sometimes when you start trying to define things, sounds a little abstract, but just try this on. What is spirit? Spirit is unbodily personal power. Okay. What is the clearest case of spirit in the universe? God. John 4. God is spirit. Now that is never said of anyone else in just that way. You are not just spirit. you are spirit, but you also have a body. And that's an important arrangement, and maybe we'll have time to talk about it some. And it's very important to talk about because one of the main dimensions of spiritual growth, discipleship, spiritual formation, or whatever you call it, is the training of the body. And the body is meant to be, as Paul says, the temple of the Holy Spirit. that this is what spirit is. Now, the kingdom of God is a spiritual reality. That is to say, it is unbodily personal power in action. And if you put that together, what we've already said, I think you'll see how it fits. So, the kingdom of God Now, remember, reality is what you can count on and what you're going to have to deal with. So, spirit and bodily personal power. What is the kingdom of God? it's God acting so this follows doesn't it if the kingdom of God is God acting this follows because God is spirit so now I'm moving real fast here and we will have questions at the end of the next session see now you need to think about things like baptism of the spirit and filling with the spirit what does it mean to be baptized in the Holy Spirit well it means God is acting all around you and of course within you God is acting all around you now it's important not to be misled by the fireworks fireworks. God gave fireworks because He was doing a new thing on the day of Pentecost. He had been teaching, and you have to see the Pentecost as a continuation of the teaching ministry of Jesus. He said, now I'm going to go away. If I don't go away, the Spirit can't come. When I go away, the Father will send His promise of the Spirit. And so Jesus told him goodbye and went up into the heavens. Right? What is the heavens? It's the sky. Now then, he tells him, go to Jerusalem, tarry at Jerusalem until you're endowed, endued with power from on high. That's the stuff that's going to be acting all around you. So when the day of Pentecost was fully come, what was the first thing that happened? They heard a sound. Where was the sound coming from? Who said that? The heavens. The heavens. Look at your Scripture. Who had just gone into heavens? Jesus. Where was this coming from? Him. And that's the whole story there, you see. And then it comes tongues of fire sitting on people, people manifesting languages that they didn't know. Good thing someone else there knew them because it was for their benefit primarily. And so the great announcement of the different presence of Christ now, the spiritual presence of God in their midst, and the power of that. And you see, the important thing that happened there was not just the external manifestations. That was important. That's a kind of incarnational witness to the presence of the Spirit. But what was really important was, all of a sudden, these little people that had been scared half to death had been hiding in a room. One who had denied Christ stood up and spoke, and the hearts of thousands of people were changed. How did that happen? Unbodily personal power. Now, I'm going to have to quit now. We'll start here when we come back. Don't be gone too long. Thank you.
