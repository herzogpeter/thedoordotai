I want you to open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians chapter 6, verses 1 through 4. In our continuing study in the book of Ephesians, chapter 6, verses 1 through 4. We've been here for two weeks and going to be here at least two more. Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is the righteous thing. but more than mechanically obeying your parents, honor your father and mother. And this is so important that it was the first commandment that came along with a promise. That it may be well with you, this is the promise, that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth. And then verse 4, where we are focusing these next couple of weeks, is this. And fathers, or parents, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction or the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Let's pray as we begin. Father, I thank you from the depth of my heart for the gifts that you have given us this morning. And I just pray that you keep on giving through your word. and through your servant. Amen. Parents, don't frustrate, don't provoke, don't incite your children to anger. Instead, here's a good idea, bring them up or train them up in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord. Well, last week, we talked about what that means to bring our children up, to train our children up. And we learned that to train our children up as we found a synonym for that word, a passage that was saying exactly the same thing was in Proverbs 22, verse 6. Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it. And we discovered that to train up a child is something far more than training a child as I would a horse. It is more than training him to go right when I want him to go right, to go left when I want him to go left, to stop and go at my command, to sit down, stand up, talk and shut up when I say so. To train up a child, to train them up, to bring them up, has to do with instilling values also. You see, I can force behavior. I could force you to do certain things if you gave me control. If I could make you feel guilty enough, if I could make you feel enough pain, I could control certain behaviors. If I have a child and I want him to sit down, I guarantee you that I can make that child sit down. I can inflict enough pain and enough anguish and enough guilt and blast them enough to get them to do what I want them to do. That has nothing to do with my ability as a father, as a friend, as someone who cares, to instill into that person values and abilities on his part to make decisions and choose directions that are his and not mine and that are still right and godly and going to lead him in the right directions. We learned, and it was exciting to understand that when we looked at Proverbs 22.6, that literally the word for train them up was the Hebrew word, Derek, and it meant to create in them a taste for whatever it is you want. Parents, talking to them about how important it is to have a good marriage and to not have relationships outside of marriage and to be godly people is wonderful. That's good instruction. But our job with our children is to create in them a taste for a good marriage. Create in them a taste for a godly walk, for healthy relationships, for spiritual depth. Why? Because they're seeing it in us. And we're sticking it in our mouth because they're watching it envelop. Unvelop. I just made up a new word. They're watching it unfold, develop. I couldn't make up my mind. They're watching it unfold right before their eyes in their home, in my home. Creating them a taste. Okay, we bring them up. How do we do that? We've already discussed that. First of all, I create in my children a taste for that which is right, for that which is good. We also talked a lot about discipline there. Be about the task of knowing them. Be about the task of knowing them was the second dimension that we talked about. First of all, creating them a taste. Be about the task of knowing them. To train them up in his own way. Train up a child in a way he should go. In his own way was what that meant. So I train him up according to, in cooperation with, his own specific, special, unique way. God made every child and made every person different. And he made them unique. And that is why they're special. There are no two children that are alike. And every one of us who have families or children of our own know that from day one. Right out of the womb, they cry different. They cry for different things. They're different. And my task as a father of three little ones and another one on the way is to discover the children in my home, who they are, to discover their uniqueness, their characteristics, their bent, and then train them according to their bent, their characteristic, and not trying to constantly make them be what I want them to be. And the promise is that if I train them up according to their own way, when they are old, they will not depart. If I train them up in my own way and in making them be the way I want them to be, that promise is not secure anymore. Train them up according to their own bent. Helen Dellen came up to me after church last Sunday and she kind of nudged me. She says, what are you going to do about all of us people who are already bent? well it's too late for you so you can just go home and I will love you the third thing and this is what we're going to be talking about this morning first of all creating them a taste secondly be about the task of knowing them thirdly this week be about the task of affirming them affirming them loving them lovingly affirming them next week by the way we're going to be talking about discipline and I want you to know that I like that word affirm just saying it builds something up in me I looked it up in Webster's Dictionary and it means this to validate you to confirm you it means literally to grant official sanction to you that's what it means to affirm someone it says listen friend you belong here child it means you're okay. It means literally, again, to give approval to. I like this part. It means to remove any doubt as to someone's value or something's value. To affirm it. There is no doubt concerning your value. It means this. To state positively. To state positively. You know what it means? It means to say yes. To affirm someone is to say yes. to them. There's a new cliche for us. We're going to walk around saying, I want to yes you. I want to yes you. I just want to stamp you right on the forehead with yes. You see what it means is my attitude toward you is yes. Child, my attitude toward you is yes. My posture toward you is affirmative. Yes. You belong. You're loved. You're welcome. You're awful important. Yes, you are loved. Yes, you are important. Yes, you are wanted. Yes, you are accepted. Yes, you are welcome. Yes, you are valuable. Yes, you're okay. I stamp you with it right all over you. Affirmation. But you know what? For some of us, and even as I was writing this, and maybe even as the words are cascading off my lips to your ears, some of us have real problems with that concept. And one of the reasons that we have problems with that concept is that even as the words come, what they're doing, as I'm talking about someone having a relationship with me that would validate me and affirm me, that those very words are striking a sensitive nerve in your heart and in my heart, and the nerve is saying all over it, deep need. Because if I feel anything this morning as I sit here in church and listen to you, preacher, I feel like people's posture towards me, my parents' posture towards me, people's attitudes and God's even toward me is no no no you're not loved no I'm not important no I'm no I'm not wanted no I'm not accepted no I'm not welcome no I'm not valuable no I'm not okay and way down in the depths of my gut it's basically this you are defective so what do you do so what do you do if that's the thing I feel way down in my gut and even though I hear you preacher I hear you talking about acceptance and stuff and I even I even know that I believe it I grew up in the church but my parents posture towards me I have felt has been no what do I do what do children do usually we do one of two things and listen to this and you've got to interact with me here you're going to have to kind of get in with this with me and think it through in your own experience but when we are in any kind of relationship and by the way one of the things I'm excited about with the things we're dealing with is that this is so much bigger than parent and child it's about relationships mine with you yours with your parents some of you are grown with kids of your own and you're going to need to reassess some of the relationships you've got with your other parents with your parents one of two things I do when I'm in a relationship, any kind of relationship where I feel like the posture towards me is no. I am not accepted. I am not loved. I am not welcome. I am not yesed. One of two things. The first thing I do is I try like crazy to change that posture. I do everything I can to make your posture towards me yes. To change it somehow from no to yes. What do I do? I'm going to try to find out what it is you want me to be, what it is you want me to say, what it is you want me to do, and I'm going to do it, And I'm going to try to somehow earn, to somehow prove to my parents, to my boss, to my pastor, to my congregation, to my husband, to my wife, to my kids, that I'm worth loving. So I perform. And if I know what you want me to do, I do it. I learn what you value when I try to do it. And if in my family what is valued most is money, I want to tell you something. And if I feel like I'm not real sure the attitude toward me is yes, I'm going to do everything I can to earn as much money as I can. And then when I earn all that money, I'll be able to bring it back to my mom and dad and go, see, I am worth loving. And if what's valued is being a doctor or a lawyer or a minister, I'm going to do everything I can to do those things and then bring it back to my mother or father or whoever it is that was putting that condition, that pressure on me. I'm going to bring it back to him. I'm going to go, see, I can do it. Maybe it's nothing more than having a family of my own. And I'm going to bring that little family. And it isn't because I'm just free and full to love my family. I'm doing it to prove stuff all my life. And I bring it back and I go, see, I am worth loving. I try to earn it and I try to prove it. And I work real hard. If beauty's the important thing, then I try like crazy to be beautiful. And I curl my hair and I put on the makeup and I make it just right. And I buy new dresses and I have a new suit. Amen.
