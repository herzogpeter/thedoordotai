I'd like to pray as we move into our time around the Word this morning. Let's pray. Father, I pray that by the power of your Spirit, beyond any human capacity I have to communicate this, that your Spirit would be strong among us. And Father, that the gift you would give us today, as it relates to the fourth chapter of 1 John, is that you would literally invade us and infect us with your heart relative to what John is saying here. I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. I'd like you to open your Bibles, if you have them, to 1 John, chapter 4. As we enter today, our third week of study, examining this rather large section from 1 John, chapter 4, verse 7, to chapter 5, verse 3, that we have entitled, What Love Demands. And that which love demands, what it calls for by virtue of what love is, is love. Having been pursued by what we have been referring to as the furious love of God, the appropriate response to that love, if not rejected, is love. First of all, love for God, but not just God, love for each other as well, for this is the commandment we heard from him. John said in chapter 4, verse 21, that the one who loves God should love his brother also. But as we've been kind of getting our arms around all that John said and meant, we've come to understand that this love is not just for our brothers and sisters in faith, but love for people in general, your neighbor in particular, your enemy as well. It's tougher when I go there. Jesus said it this way, On this hang all the law and the prophets, that you do primarily just two things, just two, love God, love people, everything else will fall into place underneath that, which is precisely why the Apostle Paul, in Philippians 4, verse 5, said this, Let your forbearing spirits be known to all men. In other words, let that be the presenting issue of your life. the first thing people see about you. It's also why he prayed in Philippians 1 verse 9. And this I pray, that our love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment. And the reason this is so central is because of what Jesus said when he said this in John 13 and John 17. By this shall all men know, that you are followers of me, and that the Father has sent me, if you have love one for another. Now, what I believe is the key verse in this fourth chapter is the 12th verse. It says this, no man has seen God at any time. And that creates a problem because we are trying to call people to a relationship with God, but if they haven't seen God at any time, what is it that we appeal to them with? How is it that we show them God? The next phrase says this, but if we love one another, the implication there clearly is this, that love has the power to reveal the face of God, the face that no one has ever seen. Primary point of last week's sermon was this, that nothing has more power on earth to reveal the face of God, to declare the truth about the amazing grace of God than when the people of God demonstrate in tangible ways that people can see and feel and hear the love of God. The bad news about this is that the opposite of that is true as well. For nothing has more power on earth to distort the face of God, to confuse the message of amazing grace, than when the people of God who claim to know the love of God do not demonstrate that love in any manifested way. Incredible power to discredit in people's minds It's the gospel that we preach. Philosopher Bertrand Russell, in his book, Why I Am Not a Christian, it's an interesting title for a book, wouldn't you say? It said this, The intolerance that has spread over the world with the advent of Christianity is one of its most curious features given its message of forbearing love. History attests, according to Russell, that religious people in general and Christians in particular tend to be narrow. And then to support his argument, he appeals to historic examples of that narrowness and lack of tolerance. He points to the Inquisitions of the Middle Ages, which is a pretty obvious place to go. Takes a special delight then in giving examples of the Geneva of John Calvin. Now, some of you may know about this, some of you may not, but Geneva was a city. And John Calvin had kind of established that it was to be a utopian society. The kingdom of God on earth, heaven come down to earth is what it was designed to be, but it was going to be done pretty much with force, and we were going to just make it be this way. In this city of Geneva, church attendance was compulsory. Officials could summon anyone for questions pertaining to faith and put them into jail if they got it wrong. Laws covered such issues as how many dishes could be served at a meal and appropriate colors for garments. If you named your child anything other than an Old Testament name, you could be put in jail. The consistory beheaded a child who struck his parents. They drowned any single woman who was found pregnant. In separate incidents, Calvin's own stepson and daughter-in-law were executed when they were found in bed with lovers. Now, Russell's conclusion around all that historical data and behavior from people who said they were Christians was this. instead of expanding people's capacity for life and joy and mystery, religion in general, and Christianity in particular, seems to shrink it, end quote. So Russell dismissed it all because of that, and so do many others. See, when we bail out on love, even to get what we think is a good thing, even to procure for ourselves what we think might be a God thing, like a utopian society, the kingdom of God on earth, but we bail on love to get it. We ruin the good thing we're trying to get. We lose our credibility. We lose our believability as kingdom people of God. Paul said it this way, if I have all faith but do not have love, I have nothing. In other words, what he's saying is this. If you operate in great faith, even build great things, but don't operate in love, you have missed the point entirely of what the gospel is and what it produces. Joseph Aldrich, in his book, Lifestyle Evangelism, says this. The key to evangelism is a beautiful bride. Think about it. Brides do not demand or force compliance. What they do is capture hearts. Tough, calloused, hardened men are known to weep in their presence. But keep this in mind as well. The church as a bride is not to be a mannequin on display in a stained glass window bridal shop. Her beauty is to be functional, operational, dynamic, and penetrating. Not content to withdraw, satisfied or obsessed with her own beauty. Fretful and preening over herself. Worried about wrinkling her dress instead. The bride that is the church stoops to serve and to spread the life that gave her life its beauty. I love the story. I've told it before. You've probably heard it if you've ever heard Anthony Campalo speak or read any of his books. He tells the story in his book, The Kingdom of God is a Party. At the time that he was flying from New York City to Honolulu for speaking engagement, found himself in the hotel room at 3 o'clock in the morning, jet-lagged. Couldn't sleep. Really hungry. Got up looking for a restaurant open in a hotel. All of them were closed. We started wandering the streets. Stumbled on a 24-hour greasy spoon cafe-type place. Ordered breakfast. Here's what happened next. As I sat there munching on my donut, Campalo says, and sipping my coffee at 3.30 in the morning, the door of the diner suddenly swung open. And to my extreme discomfort, in marched eight or nine provocative and boisterous prostitutes. It was a small place, and they sat on either side of me. Their talk was loud and crude. I felt completely out of place and was just about to make my getaway when I heard the woman sitting beside me say, tomorrow's my birthday. I'm going to be 39 years old. Her friend responded with a nasty tone. So what do you want from me, a birthday party? What do you want? You want me to bake you a cake and sing happy birthday? Come on, said the woman sitting next to me. I was just telling you it's my birthday. I don't want anything from you. I mean, why should you give me a birthday party? I've never had a birthday party in my life. Why should you do it? Well, when I heard that, says Campalo, I made a decision. She shall have a party, and we will get her a cake. I talked to Harry, the cook, and he thought it would be a good idea. He decided to help. 2.30 the next morning, I was back at the diner. Harry and I had picked up some paper, or cray paper decorations at the store and made a sign out of big pieces of cardboard that read, Happy Birthday, Agnes. Decorated the diner, did we, from one end to the other. The diner was looking good. At 3.30 on the dot, the door of the diner swung open, and in came Agnes with a friend. Everybody was ready, and when they came in, we all screamed, Happy Birthday, Agnes. Never have I seen a person so flabbergasted. Her mouth fell open, her legs seemed to buckle. Her friend grabbed her arm to steady her, and as she was led to sit on one of the stools along the counter, we sang Happy Birthday to Agnes. As we came to the end of our singing, her eyes moistened. Then when the birthday cake with all the candles on it was carried out, she lost it and just began to weep openly in front of her friends. Agnes looked down at the cake. Then without taking her eyes off of it, she slowly and softly said, Look, Harry, is it all right with you if I, I mean, is it okay if I kind of, what I want to ask you is, is it okay if I keep this cake a little while? I mean, is it all right if we don't eat it right away? He shrugged and answered, sure, it's okay. If you want to keep the cake, keep the cake. It's your cake. Take it home if you want to. Can I? She asked. Then looking at me, she said, I live just down the street a couple doors. I want to take the cake home, okay? I'll be right back, I promise. She got off the stool, picked up the cake, and carrying it like it was the holy grail, she walked slowly toward the door. When the door closed, there was a stunned silence in the place, not knowing what else to do. I broke the silence by saying, what do you say we pray? I prayed for Agnes. I prayed for Agnes' salvation. I prayed that her life would be changed and God would be good to her. When I finished, Harry leaned over to Connor with a trace of hostility in his voice and said, hey, you never told me you were a preacher. What kind of church do you belong to? In one of those moments when just the right words came, I answered, I belong to a church that throws parties for horrors at 3.30 in the morning. Harry waited a moment and then almost sneered as he answered no you don't, there's no church like that if there was I'd join it, I'd join a church like that but your forbearing spirit you may know unto all men now, before we all melt down into a big blob of sentimental goo around the story we need to recognize the danger of what he just did And there is some danger here. It's a danger I introduced last week. I promised we'd address this week. The danger is this twofold. Number one, that in our effort to radically love and identify with people like Agnes, which is the call of God on us to do, that in desiring to do that, we could get overwhelmed by and drawn into their sin. That's a very real danger. I mean, imagine just for a moment how different that story I just read would be if after all the good stuff, the party and the cake, Kampala would have slept with Agnes. I mean, what if that would have happened? All of a sudden, he didn't do that. All of a sudden, though, this story changes. Suddenly, it's a very sad story. Indeed, it's a tragic story if that were to take place. The cake and the party were a nice thing, but now he's just like every other guy she ever met. Instead of 30 bucks for sex, he bought her a birthday cake for sex. So that's a real danger. But there's another danger. It's just as significant. The other danger is this. That so fearing that, so fearing being overwhelmed by sin and drawn into sin, we build walls to protect ourselves. Without meaning for these walls to become this way, they become forts. We call them church. It feels very safe inside this place. But here's the problem. No one sees the face of God. See, the real beauty, what made you clap, something instinctive rose in you because what happened to Agnes was this. Without a sermon, Agnes saw the face of God. Admittedly, it was just a glimpse. She didn't get saved on the spot. Maybe someday, weeks later, months later, maybe years later, she would remember. Maybe at a time when her life is falling apart, she might remember the time she saw the face of God and wonder if there's help for her there. Matthew 5, verse 13, Jesus acknowledged this problem I'm talking about. And he addressed it this way. On one hand, verse 13, don't lose your saltiness, church. In other words, don't compromise with sin. But, verse 14 and 15, don't hide your light either. In other words, don't build a fort in order to not compromise with sin. That is not the solution to an uncompromising faith. Instead, let your light shall shine, verse 16. In other words, let your light shine in such a way that men and women can see your good works and glorify our Father who is in heaven. Well, the million-dollar question, obviously, around all that is this. How do you find that balance? How do we live and love that way? How do we protect our saltiness, as it were, without hiding our light? Well, I do not pretend to have all the answers to that question, but there are four things that do indeed occur to me as being necessary to live and love this way. I think, first of all, we need the right spirit. Second of all, I think we need the right soil. Third, we need the right model. And fourth, we need the right depth. Now, that fourth one, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on, so usually I have three and you're going, this is going to be a long one. Fear not. I'll be a little bit afraid. It all begins with the right spirit. And the right spirit is embodied in what I've been kind of making reference to in this whole series. It is something that Paul said in Philippians 1 verse 9 when he talked about abounding love. And this I pray that your love may abound still more and more. The key word there is abound. It's a very colorful word when you get down into the definition of it from the Greek. To abound means, and let your imagination kind of run away here a little bit, it means to turn out abundantly. And what we're talking about is love. So that your love would turn out abundantly. It also means to exceed, to overflow. Now that's the word that kind of captured my imagination. To like a fountain, as it were, overflow and splash on whatever it is, or whoever it is, that gets close. Think with me here. When Paul, in Philippians 1 verse 9, prays that their love would abound still more and more, he is not simply praying that they would love each other, that they would love their neighbor, or even that they would love God more and more. Though, those things certainly would happen if their love was abounding. What he is actually praying is different than that. It's this, that the love that is resident inside of them would begin to abound in them, turning out abundantly from them, indiscriminately spilling on everyone around them, on whoever happens to come close to them. See, in this kind of love, the person who is getting loved is not getting loved because they are particularly lovable. The reason love is kind of splashing on them is because of what's abounding in you. You got that? By the way, this is without abounding love, without love resident in you, coming from you and spilling on, without love resident in me, coming from me and spilling on some people, not many people are going to get loved without that kind of love somewhere. Because the most lovable among us, I promise you, let's just pick the most lovable person here. Where are you? Raise your hand, would you please? I promise you, just by raising your hand, you would become less lovable. Just right there. I promise you, you find the most lovable person on earth you spend enough time with them they will end up being rather resistible we are all pretty resistible love does not happen people will not get loved if somewhere along the line it's not in me, abounding from me pouring out exceedingly it's inside me getting on you that's the picture here here's the point whatever else characterizes this kind of love is characterized by its indiscriminate nature abounding love is indiscriminate it spills on whoever gets in its way and that is the right spirit consider the rose says anthony de mello in his book the way of love is it possible for a rose to say i'll offer my fragrance to good people and withhold it from bad or can a lamp withhold its rays from a wicked person who seeks to walk in its life. It could do that only by ceasing to be a lamp. Observe how helplessly and indiscriminately a tree gives its shade to everyone, good and bad, young and old, high and low, to animals and humans, even to those who seek to cut it down. I love the story that Brennan Manning tells in his book, Ob His Child. In fact, he told a story in this pulpit some years ago about the time that he and Rosalyn, Rosalyn is his wife, were approached at an airport by a young girl who pinned an unwanted flower on both of their jackets then asking for a donation to support her mission. You know what's going on here. You've maybe been approached by this kind of person and if you're like me, you see them ahead of time and manage to run the other way. This is kind of an interesting confrontation on me, actually. When pressed by Brennan to identify the mission she was involved in, she finally admitted it was a unification church led by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon. She was a Mooney. Brennan, in his book and also in the story he told here, then shares his thoughts. The first thing I thought was, I'm against that. I'm against the Unification Church, Reverend Sun Myung Moon, but I'm not against her. Suddenly he was able to see her as a lost, naive, vulnerable, and deceived, though very sincere little girl. So here's what he said to her. I deeply admire your integrity and fidelity to your conscience. You're out here trampling the streets, doing what you really believe in. You are a challenge to anyone who claims the name Christian. Rosalind then took it a step further and embraced this little girl. Brennan got caught up in the moment and embraced them both. In the middle of the embrace, the little girl asked, Are you Christians? When they said yes, she lowered her head and began to cry. You're the first Christians who've been nice to me. Most look at me with contempt. Some scream at me and tell me I'm demon-possessed. One woman hit me with her Bible. Which is very helpful. You showed me a different way. Let me tell you what they showed her. They showed her the face of God. Admittedly, just a glimpse. This girl didn't fall on her knees and accept Jesus in that airport mezzanine area. but maybe one day when the lies that she's living in right now begin to unravel and not work and fall apart and are maybe by the grace of God somehow exposed even to her maybe that day she'll remember the day she saw the face of God and just begin to wonder if she could find some help there Abounding love is indiscriminate It splashes on whoever gets in his way. They did not love her because she was particularly lovable. It was something that was going on inside of them. It just splashed on her. And, beloved, that is the right spirit. That is the kind of spirit that is going to help us maintain our savor but not hide our light. Now, contrast that story I just told you about Brennan and Rosalyn with this one. Reverend Fred Phelps, pastor of Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas, is a man whose activity I became familiar with some years ago through an article in the Star Tribune, which brought attention to Reverend Phelps' practice of organizing large groups to picket the funerals of AIDS victims with signs that say things like this. Now, what I'm about to have come out of my mouth from this pulpit are vile things, but these are the things that the posters have said. And this guy is presenting himself as the face of God, as it were. Science said things like this. God hates fags. Fags die, God laughs. AIDS cures fags. Well, I knew of him from that article years ago. And in light of the sermon I'm working on, obviously, I wondered if he was still around. I called my administrative assistant. She got on the Internet. It didn't take her five minutes. My phone rang. She says, oh, Dave, he's out there in all his hate-filled splendor. Most recently, Reverend Phelps organized a large group of people to make their presence known at the funeral of Matt Shepard. Do you remember him? Matt Shepard is that 21-year-old gay college student who was pistol-whipped and left tied to a fence in a frozen Wyoming prairie. And signs outside his funeral read, Matt Burns in Hell, God Hates Fags. Now, I'm not really sure I would enjoy engaging Reverend Phelps in a conversation at all. But if I did, I'd have some questions. And if I did, I would have to work real hard at wondering what love looks like for him, too. But as I imagine what I would want to ask him, and as I imagine what his responses would be, I'm pretty sure it would be something like this. I know what my questions would be. Reverend Phelps, why are you doing this? Oh, yeah, to rid the community of this vile? Yeah, okay, okay, okay. But, see, what strikes me odd, Reverend Phelps, about this whole scene and what you're doing is this, that most people weep at funerals. Why aren't you weeping? I mean, you act like you're mad. Well, I am mad. Why aren't you mad? It's about time we did something about this vile, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, it's about time we did something. I agree, I agree. Let's do something. But before we do something, let's wonder about something. Well, let's wonder. What would Jesus do? Where would Jesus be? Seriously. Are you one of those bracelet wear guys? Really, this time it's important to ask that question. What would Jesus do? Where would he be? See, I have to say, Reverend Phelps, I don't think he'd be with you. In fact, if he were anywhere involved in this funeral scene, I think he'd be at the funeral with the people in the pain. And I actually believe that maybe with tears in his eyes, he would call them to himself. And he would call them from this sin that steals and kills and destroys. He would call them from that. And he would offer them amazing grace. And I even believe they might not take it. Not naive. Not everybody who gets offered grace wants it. I don't. They might not want it. They might even scorn him for the offer, loving the life they have. But that is what he'd do, and that is where he'd be. And that is an entirely different spirit. It's the right spirit, marked by abounding love, not because the person being loved is so unbelievably lovable. It's because of the resident in you love that's been placed there by the God who lives in you, who happens to be loved. This is, by the way, why verse 4 says, the one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. How on earth can you have God living in you who is love and you not love? It is absolutely impossible. Don't tell me you know God. That's the right spirit. But for that spirit to grow, it requires, number two, the right soil. And the soil in which the spirit of abounding love grows is amazing grace. Don't you think about that? You know it's true. As I just go through this, you think about how it is that grace has landed on you. And if it hasn't, then you may not be able to relate to this, but if you have, it will. I'll say it this way. The person who is most likely to extend forbearing love is the person who is aware of their need of the same. The person who is most likely to freely dispense amazing grace is the person who has let that amazing grace touch them. Who has been affected by the furious love of God. Who saw their sin and grace land on it. People who've received grace. You can't give what you don't have, beloved. And you do give what you do have. Luke chapter 7, verse 47. Jesus is trying to explain to Simon the Pharisee something he doesn't understand. It just blew him away. Why this woman who was a sinner would bestow this extravagant gift on Jesus, this gift of love. And the gift of love went way beyond the vial of alabaster that was too expensive for her to give away. She was creating a spectacle. She was weeping. Her oil and the water got all mixed up with her hair. She just made a fool of herself. But it was all an expression of love. Simon didn't get it. Jesus tried to explain it to him this way. See, Simon, here's the deal. Her sins, which are many, have been forgiven. He who has been forgiven much loves much. He who has been forgiven little loves little. Is the problem that Simon, see, some Simons, the Simons of the world, hear that and go, well, yeah, that's the problem. Maybe I should go out and sin a whole bunch so I can feel forgiven. No, you don't get it, Simon. You want to find your sin, look at your heart. You are the most arrogant, proud, self-right. You are further from God than this sinning woman because you just think you're all that and you are not all that. And if you saw that, you would fall on your face desperate for grace. And then you'd get it. And then you know what would happen when you got it? You know what you'd do? You'd start giving it. Beloved people, most likely to freely extend for bearing love and amazing grace are the people who are aware of their own need and have tasted the sweetness of the same. Luke chapter 10, Jesus tells a story. You've all heard this story. Of a man who fell among thieves, who stripped, beaten, left for dead, desperately in need of help. Priest and Levite, respectable people, of good religious pedigree, passed by the other way, doing their best to avoid this person. The Samaritan, considered by the priests and the Levites to be a half-breed heretic, they stopped and helped. Why did the Samaritan help? Well, I mean, you could spend many weeks unpacking what was going on in the Samaritan and how that worked. But I'll just tell you at least one reason the Samaritan stopped and helped. I think it's because he knew what it felt like to be naked. He knew what it felt like to need help. He knew what it felt like to need amazing grace. And when he saw someone who needed it, he went there. It's not that complicated. Matthew 9, verse 9. Jesus set his affection on and he released his grace on a tax collector named Matthew. Now, what you've got to do here is kind of make a switch in your thinking because most of us, when we think of Matthew, we think of Matthew the gospel writer, which is the same guy. We think of Matthew the saint, Matthew the disciple, but he wasn't always that way. And what's exciting about Matthew 9-9 is this. Jesus is meeting him there when he wasn't that way. He wasn't the disciple, the writer of the gospel, or the saint. And when he wasn't that way, it was then that Jesus called him to himself. He said, Matthew, no, you, yeah, no, no, don't clean up first. Just you come, you come here, I want you to be with me. Matthew responded to that call and says, I will follow you. But first he threw a party. Very strange, verse 9, Jesus calls him. Verse 9, Matthew says, okay. Verse 10, Matthew throws a party. Well, guess who's coming to dinner? Verse 10, publicans, sinners, prostitutes, drunkards, and Jesus. oh what are you doing there well that's exactly what the pharisees wanted to know what are you doing there pharisees who know very little of abounding love and who prove their holiness by separating themselves from publican sinners prostitutes and drunkards separating themselves from the very people who needed abounding love the most ask jesus why i mean jesus if you're a holy man. Why don't you just hang around holy people? Why associate yourself with cruddy characters? Jesus answered, it's just not that difficult. It's not that complicated. He said, here's why. It's not the healthy you need a physician, but the sick. What was implied in there, by the way, is the Pharisees who were questioning him were very sick, and they needed a physician. They just had no clue how sick they were, so they weren't calling for the doctor. These other guys were, and that's who gets grace. do you know what happens when sick people are made well you know what happens when sinners get grace they come up grateful and that gratitude beloved is the soil in which abounding love grows see Matthew spent the rest of his life giving away amazing grace partly because he never forgot how much he needed it himself I love what Frederick Buechner writes in his book the magnificent defeat. He says this, though it is true that the church must always dissociate itself from sin, it can never have any excuse for keeping sinners at a distance. If the church remains self-righteously aloof from failures, irreligious and immoral people, it cannot be the church. But if it is constantly aware of its own sin, of its own need for grace and forgiveness, maybe for being so self-righteous. It can then live in the joyful awareness of receiving grace and forgiveness itself, thus dispensing grace and forgiveness to the people who need it most. Often hobbling through our church doors on Sunday morning comes grace on crutches, sinners still unable to throw away their false supports and stand upright into their freedom as children of God. But their mere presence in church on this Sunday morning is a flickering candle that represents a desire to maintain contact with God somehow. So what do we say to people like that? What do we say to people like that who really do need help, but they're not doing very well right now? Here's what we say. Matthew 12, verse 20, a bruised reed he will not break off, and a smoldering wick he will not put out. Here's what we say. There's grace for you if you want it. There's grace for you if you know you need it. There's grace for you if you're willing to receive it. So, beloved, how do we walk this line? That's the question we're asking. How do we walk this line of, on one hand, not losing our savor by compromising with sin, but then not hiding our light by building a wall that becomes a fort? Well, I think it takes the right spirit, abounding love. And I think that right spirit is established and grows in the right soil. Amazing grace. Third, it takes the right model. And this is just so obvious. I've already even developed this already with other illustrations, but the model is obviously Jesus himself. Donald Gray in his book, Jesus, The Way to Freedom, says this. One of the great mysteries of the gospel is Jesus' strange attraction to the unattractive, his strange desire for the undesirable, strange love for the unlovely. The old image of a mean, vindictive God gives way in Jesus to the God of faith who cherishes people, all people, and desires to make their abode with them if he will have them. We do well to remember, he says, that Jesus was called a friend of sinners. A friend? He didn't just condi sing. No, a friend. It was a day like any other day. The city could have been any city, actually, but on this day it was Jericho. The crowds were there, as always. The people were pushing and shoving, as always. The Pharisees were picking, trying to figure out what Jesus was doing wrong, as always. And right in the middle of all that, that's when Jesus spotted him. Short little character up in a tree, trying to see his name was Zacchaeus. How he knew his name, I'll never know, but he did. Before anybody knew what was happening, Jesus and Zacchaeus were planning a meal. And in the planning of this meal, the heart of Zacchaeus began to soften. The heart of Zacchaeus grew tender. See, for an Orthodox Jew, the sharing of a meal meant more than food and drink. It meant friendship. Even today, an Orthodox Jew might have coffee and a bagel with somebody, anybody. But to extend an invitation to dinner is to invite that person into the miniature sanctuary of the dining room table where we will celebrate one of the most beautiful and sacred experiences that life can give, friendship. And that's what Zacchaeus heard in this exchange between Jesus who saw him in the tree and when Jesus called him from that tree, what dawned on him, and he might not have put the words together, but these are things you sense in your spirit. He's not just trying to sell me. Have you ever felt that, like, some evangelistic? They're trying TO SELL ME. They're being nice to ME because they're going TO SELL ME. No, HE'S NOT TRYING TO SELL ME. HE JUST WANTS TO BE WITH ME. I MEAN, COULD IT BE? COULD IT BE HE WANTS TO BE WITH ME AND NOT JUST SELL ME? I THINK HE LIKS ME. I THINK HE LIKS. DOES HE LIKE ME? I THINK HE LIKS ME. Henry Nouwen says this about that. Tenderness is what happens when you know you are sincerely and deeply liked by someone. Defense mechanisms, sarcasm, aloofness, name-dropping, self-righteousness, the appearance of having it all together starts to fall away. I drop my mask. I stop disguising my voice. Hello. Hello. Tenderness, forbearing love, is what came to Zacchaeus, and before he could bat an eye, it was coming from Zacchaeus. And while the Pharisees were grumbling that Jesus had gone to the house of a sinner again, the sinner was turning to Jesus, and with newfound tenderness, saying things like this, Lord, half of everything I own, I will give to the poor. And to those I have defrauded, I will pay back four times. Jesus never told them to do that. See, tenderness is what happens when you find out that someone sincerely and deeply likes you. Remember a few weeks ago, that old Irish guy, 80 years old, jumping on the Sea of Killarney, me abba, he likes me. Makes him tender. part of what i like about jesus as the model here that we need to notice is that it's just not that hard to do i mean it doesn't require a seminary education to to to make a friend and and and by the way when i say it's not hard to do that i'm saying it that way because most of us have this impression talked about this i think it was last week that that if i'm going to share my faith the The real key in that is that I'm smart enough and I know the answers well enough and I need to study a little bit more. And we do need to study. And it's good to have the answers and be ready. But what we're learning here is there's something more powerful than your right answer if you just love each other. That can reveal the face of God to people. Well, anybody can do that. Maybe not. Maybe not just anybody. Because, beloved, to really pull this off, so that people who have never seen God at any time might actually come to see the face of God. It doesn't require a seminary education, but what it does require is the right spirit, abounding love. In fact, if you have the right information and the wrong spirit, it would really be good if you just were quiet for a while. For that right spirit to happen, you need the right soil. And that's amazing grace. That you saw your own sin, and that grace was lavished upon you, and you let the love of God in, and it just ravished your soul. And now it just comes from you. It's what you give. Why? Because it's what you got. It requires the right model, Jesus himself, and maybe even a thought-out rejection of the wrong models we've gotten. And coming back to the simplicity of looking at the life and the love of Christ requires finally the right substance, the right depth as people. And as I told you, I'm not going to dress this out a lot. Actually, I want to give this to you so we can kind of come back to this and develop this more next time. But I will say this about that. we're kind of at this point say you've you've gotten someone to dinner okay what do you do now you know you you've broken the isolation you've made a new friend what do you have to give away you know they're sitting by your table but do you understand that love is more than sentimental goo i mean do you have enough substance in terms of understanding how love works and what the what the idiosyncratic things of it and the demands of it are so that even in your love for this person you might realize at some point you might have to stand against this person. Do you have the right depth? Do you have the right substance? Walter Burkhardt in his book Grace on Crutches says this, the problem in the church in America is not that too much has been hidden but that too much has been seen. There has never been a time in Christian history, he says, when the name of Jesus Christ is more frequently mentioned and the content of his life and teaching so little known. By and large, American Christians today are spoon-fed on the pablum of popular religion. In one half hour, the electronic evangelist saves you, heals you, and promises you success. If you sign on with Jesus, you'll never lose your business, your marriage will never fail, and you'll never taste poverty. If you're an attractive 19-year-old girl and you accept Christ, you might become Miss America. Bless God, hallelujah. Just believe. and if you're an athletic 19 year old boy and you accept Christ you might go to the NFL hallelujah bless God just believe listen to what he says let the church go underground if need be and as it lowers its profile let it raise its expectations of what the genuine life and love of the spirit of God at work among people really is Let us preserve and present the beauty of the gospel, not with showy or defensive fervor, but with humility and grace, worship and prayer, service and love. And a manner of life that can only be explained in terms of God. I mean, dream with me about a life that people would look at and go, God, it's got to be God. Let me close with this. Kind of a promise that we are for the next few weeks going to further unpack what it means to be operating with the right spirit, to be growing in the right soil, to be authentically following the right model and to be genuinely living at the right depth with the right substance, all of that working to provide for us a profound and practical understanding of what love really looks like. And the reason we're going to do that in the next couple of weeks is because the most powerful force on earth for revealing the face of God and declaring the truth about the grace of God is when the people of God who've received the grace of God demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God. I'm going to ask you as we close to do what we did last week, just quietly, close your eyes, bow your head, and just for a few moments, if this isn't affecting you at all, that's fine, but just in respect to people around who are needing to respond to this, just let this word call you. Just for a few moments, in silence, let this word call you. and this I pray that our love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment so that people our husbands and wives, our spouses, our children our parents, our friends the people we work with, the lost and dying world so that they might see the face of God pray these things in Jesus name and all God's people said Amen Amen.
