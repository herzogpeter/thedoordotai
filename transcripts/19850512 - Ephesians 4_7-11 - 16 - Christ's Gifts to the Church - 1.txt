Lord Jesus, as I was studying this week and spending time with you in this, I was just being deeply affected and changed. And Father, I feel like Satan is using all sorts of different things to keep that message from coming through clear, and we just pray in your name that he would be bound in my heart and in our hearts and that the oracles of God would be spoken clearly. I ask it in your name. Amen. this study in Ephesians has been rich I trust that it's affected you even if I was to kind of put a word or share with you a concept that the book of Ephesians is about it's this that it's about the body of Christ the body of Christ and not just what we usually think of when we think of the body of Christ too often what we think of when we say that little phrase is just the Christians who belong to Jesus is the body of Christ. It's a label I have for them. But we are discovering in the book of Ephesians that the body of Christ is the body of Christ. That it's body too, that Jesus came 2,000 years ago and he was the exact representation of God and he was the manifestation of God and he communicated to people who God was and now the church is that same manifestation, body too. The body. And we have been talking about the tremendous privilege is that we have as believers to belong to that magnificent body, his body. But we have also been stressing very diligently the responsibility that is laid at the feet of every believer because he's part of that body, to be the body. The last three weeks we have been discovering that one of the vital dimensions of our ability to be the body of Christ has been wrapped up in our living and loving unity. be diligent to preserve the unity and we called it fellowship koinonia that fire of the church is the fact that you and I are one and we love one another and all those one another's were what it was all about every one of us know that God wants to reach the world with his truth if you went to Sunday school for two weeks you would know that that's what God wants for his church he wants the church to reach the world with his truth but the groundwork for evangelization the foundation for evangelization the platform that makes the message of Jesus Christ hearable and receivable and what gives it clarity and what gives it credibility is our loving unity a church can do absolutely nothing I shouldn't say that a church can do very little to overcome a testimony to the world of fragmentation and isolation and division and strife and bitterness. Because when there is in the church the body of Christ, strife and divisions and envying and jealousies, when that's in the body, the world looks at the church and they hear the words we're saying, but they're empty and they're hollow and there's nothing there. We lose our credibility right now to be the body. We are the body of Christ. And if they don't see it in us, they're not going to see it. Listen, we need to be committed to being the body. We need to be committed to being his hands and his feet and his eyes and his ears. And if we aren't committed to those kinds of things as a church, then what we need to realize is that we are wasting our theological breath when we're talking about the wonderful love and forgiveness and acceptance that there is in Christ. If they don't see it in the body, they're not going to see it. And it's going to ring hollow. You remember the church in Corinth? I've alluded to this more than once. But the church in Corinth was a beautiful illustration to us of a carnal church, a fleshly church. They were riddled with strife. They were riddled with division. Paul wrote to them, and in 1 Corinthians chapter 3, he says, I wish like crazy I could talk to you like mature men and women, but I can't. And the reason I can't and I can't give you meat, you're still sucking on the milk. the little pablum from the Word. And the reason I can't is because there's still strife and there's still jealousy. There's no unity. You're not being the body. And then I kick my mind into 1 Corinthians 13. 1 Corinthians 13. Isn't that... That's the passage we read at weddings, right? It's just the lovely passage about love, right? I'm beginning to see that passage as one of the strongest rebukes that Paul has ever given his church. because what he's saying is we begin that 13th chapter and you go home and read it. And he says you want to speak with the voices of tongue and of angels and you want to be up there and preach the word and you want to tell them what's right and you want to give and you want to help the poor. And what he says is save your breath. Save your breath. If there isn't unity and if there isn't love, then you're wasting your time because you've lost the message. If they don't see it in you, when you come and talk about a loving Christ and you come and talk about an accepting Christ and a forgiving Christ, you're wasting your breath if there isn't love. You're a noisy gong and an offensive noise. Your talk about Christ and your theological niceties and your right things are just offensive. They grate on the ear. The call of God to His people, to His church, is to be the body, isn't it? We've been learning that and it's moved me deeply. How do we be the body? How do we function like that? Two vital functions we've been spending the last three weeks or so talking about one of those functions. It's simply this, that we need to be a fellowship. We need to be a unity. The one another's, receive one another, love one another, accept one another, confess your sin to one another, forgive one another. Our greatest impact is that loving unity. that fellowship, that koinonia. But there is another prong, there is another function of the church that brings about the fullness of the stature of Christ. First of all, we have fellowship. Second of all, we have the ministry and the functioning of the saints in the body. The service, the ministry, the using of the gifts. And Paul is moving into that particular dimension of the body of Christ as we move to this text. Verse 7, let's read it. But to each one of us, grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift. That can also be read, the gift of Christ. Therefore, it says, when he ascended on high, and let me just say this so you can understand it, when he ascended on high, by the way, this is also Psalm 68. This is not original to Paul. He is talking about Psalm 68. When he ascended on high, he did two things. One, he led captive a host of captives, and two, he gave gifts to men. Now in verse 9 he goes on to explain what he just said. Now this expression, he ascended. What does it mean except that he also had descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who ascended is himself also he who ascended far above all the heavens that he might fill all things. And he gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastor teachers. By the way, that word is really one in the Greek. There should just be a hyphen there. Pastor teachers, one thing. Now, at first reading, I'm sure that you're all kind of going, yeah, that's wonderful. I have no idea what that means. And most of the time, what we would do with a passage like this is just kind of skip over it. In fact, that was my first impression because I looked at that and I said, I'll get in the pulpit and I can see myself saying, no, you know what that means? Help! I don't know what that means. I'd like to know. But I found out what it means. And it's something that has opened again. a door for my understanding of the ministry of the gifts in a way I've never known before, and I want to share it with you. I have entitled this Christ's Gift to His Church. Christ's Gifts to His Church. What Christ has done for us. You know, in the Word of God, and even in my preaching, I know that one of the things I'm doing all the time is telling us, telling you and telling me the things that are incumbent upon us as a believer, the things we need to do, the things we need to be doing in terms of our response to Christ. There's a tremendous, just volumes of material in the Word of God that exhorts us to action, commanding us. There are things that are incumbent upon the believer. There are binding statements in the Word of God laid at the feet of the believer. And our response to those binding statements in the Word of God is obedience. In other words, I'm simply saying this, that God repeatedly says to us, Do this. Do this. but the flip side of that is this the god says i've also done this i've also done this you see christianity is not just what we do for god we would get very distorted and messed up and sick if our perception of christianity turned into something like that we exhort and we teach and we need to understand what our responsibility is in terms of obedience but it is not just what i do for Christ. The very core of the gospel is what he has done for me in Christ. That's the core of the gospel. And it's bound up in one little very simple word. The word is grace. And I find that word in verse 7. But to each one of us he has given grace. Grace. That word just melts me. Grace. By definition it would simply be this, an act of giving. And that's God's nature, isn't it? right? The act of giving, that is God's nature. We talk of the God of all grace, right? The God of all giving. We talk about the gospel of grace, the gospel of giving, God's self-donation of himself. We talk about our responsibility to obey that. Christianity's first definition is grace. Obedience is tucked in underneath. But giving is just saying grace is giving is not encompassing the entire meaning of that word because for God, grace in its most magnanimous terminology is not just giving, but giving of Himself. God's self-donation. John 3.16, it says, God so loved the world that He what? He gave what? Himself. God's self-donation. That's what grace is. Jesus came to the world and said, I give you My self. I am the living water. If you're thirsty, drink of Me. I am the living bread if you are hungry what? I'll give you me I am the light of the world if you're in darkness what I'll give you? I'll give you me and he puts in us his life and he grants to us his kingdom and he gives to us his inheritance and his riches that's the gospel he gives and he gives and he gives and he gives that's grace and after a while i get the idea that he really enjoys giving things to his people and as i realized that one of the very functions of god and christ and the holy spirit and his very nature is is that christ gives and that the holy spirit gives and as that god gives and as i realize that that it's all of grace and that's just his nature i'm not surprised at all to come to verse seven and see that he gives something more but what is he talking about here i had to give you all that stuff about grace to lead you into this. Because what he's doing is he's talking about grace and he's setting us up for the next thing that he gives us. And we think in terms of salvation and the kingdom and the inheritance, but there's something else he's talking about that's all of grace, it's all of giving, and it's all a self-donation of himself to us. What did he give? I'll tell you what he gave. He gave us gifts. He gave us gifts and it's all of grace. Verse 7 again, but to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift, the gift of Christ. This is, you know what, this today is not going to be easy. You are going to have to dig with me and you are going to have to follow along and I encourage you to take out a piece of paper and a pencil and this is not going to be, I had such a tendency to kind of skim over this somehow, but there's no way we can do it. We've got to dig in and understand this. And I'm going to tell you something, if you come with me and if you follow along and if you take your notes, you're going to be richly blessed from God's word this morning if you do that. It's going to open a door for you that you've never understood. Basically, the text from verse 7 to verse 11 breaks down into three basic groups. And I'm going to name them for you and it'll help us build. This will be the skeleton we'll build on that. First of all, we talk about the gifts of Christ to the individual believer. That's verse 7. Christ's gift. The gift of Christ to who? To individual believers. The second thing I want you to note is Christ's gift to the total church. And that's verse 11. Christ's gift to the total church is apostles and prophets, and I'm going to explain that later, but just so you have the outline here. And then the third thing is this. Paul has an interjection here right in the middle, and what he's doing is explaining how Christ earned the right to give the gift. Okay? Okay. Let's hit it. First of all, gifts of Christ to the individual a believer, verse 7. First of all, I want you to notice this, to each one, unto each one. You know something? Just because you're a believer, just because you've received Jesus Christ into your heart, there are certain things that you gain whether you like it or not. In fact, we could go into several different books, and I could entitle them things that God has given to you whether you like it or not. Romans 1 to 11, things that God has given to you whether you like it or not. Ephesians 1 to 4, things that God has given to you as believers whether you like it or not. They're yours. To each one, no one has been left out. No one has been cheated. To each one, grace is given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Let me summarize that verse so you understand it, then we'll go on. To summarize it, it's simply this. Christ has granted to each believer, based on an exercise of his self-donation, a gift. A gift. Okay? Keep following with me. I want you to notice something else, a very significant word. He's given, each one to us, he's given grace according to the measure. I want you to notice that word. Write it down, measure. The Greek word there is metron. We get our word metric or meter. It has to do with quantity. It has to do with quantity. In other words, each one has a measured out gift from Christ. Got it? You following with me? Each believer has a measured out gift from Christ. A certain quantity, it has a certain definition, it has a certain limitation, there are certain parameters to it, and certain capabilities. I want you to notice something else about this gift of Christ to individuals, that it's in the singular. Now, I had problems with this, and I don't like it especially, but I want to explain this to you, and I think it's going to broaden your concept of the gifts. It's in the singular, and I have to be honest with the text. I'd like it to be in the plural, but it has not destroyed my view of the gifts, but it's enhanced. It has brought it all together. In fact, in 1 Peter 4, I have exactly the same kind of terminology. It says this, as each one has received the gift, a gift. Now, there's a big controversy, and we talk about it all the time. I don't know, you know, I see, I have this feeling that that believers can have one gift. That's all they can have. They can have one gift, or they can have, see, I believe that believers can have five gifts. I know some believers have three gifts, and they have little tags on them. Teaching, exhortation, ruling. They have three gifts, right? Wrong. One gift. One gift. The gift. The gift from Christ. But let me explain here and let me continue to teach here within the gift that Christ has given to you. It's like, picture it like a little box, okay? And Christ, when you receive him, everyone receives the gift. And you receive the gift. It's like a little box and you open it up and within that box is just a multitude of expressions, a multitude of categories of giftedness. Your gift, the gift, a gift, singular. But within that gift, there's a multiplicity of God's expressing himself through you in marvelous, wonderful ways. We like to list them in 1 Corinthians 12 and Romans 12. We have lists for us, and that's wonderful. But I believe with all my heart that what those are are simply lists of categories of giftedness. The point is this. The point is this. And by the way, I ought to tell you this. This whole sermon is nothing more than an introduction to next week. So we're not going to get anywhere today. No, we are. We're going to get into Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12. That's what I wanted to tell you. I don't want you to think I'm kind of skimming over that and saying what they are and not proving it. We're going to go back, and I'm going to teach those passages. The point is this. Every believer has received a gift. The gift. Now watch. Again, I absolutely believe that your gift is in the singular, and I believe also that probably the gift, the gift that Christ has given you, could incorporate one, it could incorporate 20 expressions of categories of giftedness. Let me just take me. I'm a pastor, okay? I'm the pastor of this church. So right off the bat, from the Word of God, I know that if I am going to function as I ought in the church and do the things God's called me to do, I have got to teach and I have got to rule. I have got to do those two things. There's a whole bunch of other things I've got to do too. But those are two I know. 1 Timothy tells me that. And so, it's easy to look at me and say, well, that means you have two gifts, right, Dave? No, no. I have one gift, the gift that God has given to me when I receive Christ as my Savior. You know what's neat? Within that gift that Christ has given to me and within the gift that Christ has given to you, there is a multiplicity of expressions, of categories of giftedness. Herein lies the beauty of the church. Because the gifts and the blending of the category of gifts within the gift that Christ has given you is absolutely limitless. Isn't that great? You know that every one of us are different because God gave you a gift, and God gave you a gift, and it's the gift. And within that gift that he has given you is our multiplicities and categories of gifts that are unique to you and to you alone, and I don't have those same blendings as you do. You know, we like to put little tags on the gifts, don't we? And I'm going to tell you, I was even talking to some friends of mine this week, and one of the most frustrating and discouraging areas in some people's spiritual lives is this understanding of the gifts. and they're always trying to discover their gift and discover it so they can put a little tag on themselves and walk to church and everybody will know, I'm a teacher, I have the teaching gift. You have been given a gift. You have been given the gift. And in the parameters of that, multiplicity of expressions. But we want to have everybody in a little box and if you're a teacher, we go, teacher. And everybody just kind of does it the same and you're all quacking the same and it's all wonderful. It's terrible. That isn't how God works. You know what's wrong with that? You know what's wrong with that? if everybody's just the same and we put a little tag on you and you're a teacher and you have the gift of teaching and you have the gift of teaching and you have the gift of teaching and it's all the same, then you know what? You could leave and we wouldn't care. It wouldn't matter because I have the gift of teaching and I can do it just like you. So what? That isn't how it works. The beauty of the body of Christ, the beauty of what Christ did when He gave you the gift is that He blended categories of giftedness in you and in me that He didn't do with anybody else. And you know what that means? That means if I leave, you're hurt. And if you leave, I'm hurt. Because nobody can replace you. And you know what else? If you come and you sit on your hands, we lose. And you lose. But here's the rub. There's a whole lot of Christians who think that Christianity is a spectator sport. That they come and they sit and they watch and they leave. And you know what? You know what? I'm going to talk real mean here them days is over here and you know what else is neat these things aren't even my idea I had a guy come up to me last week and just a sweet warm gentleman and he kind of shook my hand and he says boy I tell you I really enjoyed that this morning and I can really tell that you're kind of coming in here and telling people to get involved and I thought well good that's good and I thought about that this week in light of this and you know what I would hate that picture of me coming and boy I'll tell you Number one on Dave's agenda is get the people involved. This isn't my idea. This isn't my idea. And if you don't function as the Lord has given you the gift, then you don't have to talk to me and explain why you aren't. Don't talk to me. It's not about me. It's about you and him and the gift he's given and the multiplicity of ways he wants to use you in the body. It just gives me goosebumps. There's one more thing about the gifts I want you to catch that moved me. this giftedness is a gift of God's grace right that's why I talked about grace at the beginning it's in the verse his giving his self-denation listen do you know that every category of the gifts every gift category that you could possibly name is perfectly illustrated in Christ think about that for a minute would you think about the list of the gifts every one of them excuse me are perfectly illustrated in Christ. Listen, if there was ever a preacher, it was Christ, right? If there was ever a teacher, it was Christ. If there was ever a ruler, it was Christ. If there was ever a servant in the whole world, it was Christ. If there was ever one who knew how to give and had the gift of giving, it was Christ, right? He is the perfect illustration of every category of giftedness. He had them all. They were all blended into Him. So that when Christ, so that when Christ gives you the gift, You know what he's doing? He's giving you himself. There's another self-denation. Do you see that? You know, that's why Peter said, when you speak, speak as it were the oracles of God. When you serve, do it as unto God. Why? Because it's God's gift to you. Do you think it's important to serve? Do you think it's important to serve? Okay. I'm done with that. That's a foundation that's been laid and we're going to build on that in the next couple of weeks. I've got to move on. Okay, first, Christ's gift to the individual believer. Verse 7, we've learned it. Verse 11, I'm going to skip just briefly to tie you into verse 11. The second thing is Christ's gift first of all to the individual believer, and then the second gift he gave to the church is individual people. He has gifted the church with individual people. He has gifted the church with apostles and prophets and evangelists and pastor teachers. And we're going to go into that deeper next week. And so I just want to lay that at your feet, and I'll explain what that means next week. But in the middle of verse 7 and verse 11, there's this section that is just a puzzlement to all of us, and we just kind of skip over it, and we don't understand it. It's an exposition by the Apostle Paul of the 68th Psalm, the 18th verse. And I, again, believe that if we grasp this, it will forever deepen our understanding of the gifts that Christ has given to his church. So if you're taking notes, the second thing here is how Christ earned the right to give the gifts, verses 8 through 10. Let's read verse 8. And when he ascended on high, he led captive a host of captives. He gave gifts, and he gave gifts to men. Now, let me stop right there. Again, I've already told you that this is a passage, this is an excerpt from the 68th Psalm. and he, Paul, has taken it out of that psalm and brought it here and he's explaining it. He's using it to illustrate something and we don't know what it is yet. But if we were to go back, and that's what we'd have to do, that's what the Ephesians would have to do, is go back to that 68th psalm and read it. And as we read it, we would begin to get a picture in that 68th psalm that what is happening there is there's a picture there of God as the conquering hero. The conquering hero. In verse 1 of Psalm 68, God sets out, and he is about to do war with his enemies. You got that? He's about to do war with his enemies. And he goes to war, and the battle is being fought, and God wins. Isn't that wonderful? God wins. He always does. So he does. And now, as the psalm is progressing, and the war has been won, and God is coming back victorious in all these wonderful things, what is happening is he begins to climb the mountain to the hill of Zion, and all of the things are coming with him, and he's got all the spoils of war, and he's got the captives that he captured when he was there. And this picture ties in very well with the things that happened in Israel. The same kind of thing. The king would go out to battle. And when he would go out to battle, the battle would be waged and then he would win the battle. And if he won the battle, he would come back to Jerusalem and as he came into Jerusalem with all this pageantry and all this glory and everybody just shouting and clamoring and hailing him as king and hailing him as the victor, he would begin to ascend this hill to Mount Zion. the crowning point of all Jerusalem, and ascend the hill, and there he would have in his possession two things, the spoils of war, and all the people that he had captured with him, and he'd be coming with this great entourage of people, and he'd get to the top, and everyone would just shout, Hosanna, the king. The picture here, of the conquering hero, the victor, the spoils of war on one hand, and those people that he had captured on the other. Basically, two kinds of captives. Just to explain and to teach here, two kinds of captives. There were, first of all, people of the enemy that he would capture. And these enemies at one time had dominion over them. They had ability to kill them, to hurt them. And now they were bound up. And this king, this victorious king, would bring these bound enemies with him. And everyone would rejoice because now they were bound. And there was another one, there was another group of people that were called. And this is what it means. He led captive a host of captives. It means this, that very often in war, when Israel would go to war, the enemy would capture their people. And when this conquering king would go into that country, he would pull out of that country those people who had been held captive by the enemy, and he would set them free, and he would let them go, and he'd bring back his own people. He led captive a host of captives. He brought them back. And then the spoils of war. That's really interesting. It's a nice picture, but what does it mean? What does it mean? The Ephesians had to ask the same thing, and so in verse 9, Paul begins to explain what he meant. And it comes together. He says, I understand that you're not going to understand what this ascension means. You know, it's just a psalm. You've heard it all your life. You're a little Jewish kid. You know, it's wonderful. But you grew up with Psalm 68, and you read it, and you never knew what it meant. I'm going to tell you what it meant. This expression, he ascended, what does it mean? except that he also had descended into the lower parts of the earth. Verse 9, verse 10. He who descended is himself also he who ascended above all the heavens that he might fill all things. What he's telling them right here is that the one who ascended that we talk about in Psalm 68, what that's really speaking of is Christ. That's who it is. Who is it that ascended? What does it mean except that he is the one also he descended? What this is speaking of, and now we've got... Oh, I hope you're hanging with me here because this is tough. What this is speaking of specifically is a passage in 1 Peter. And let's turn to it right now. 1 Peter 3.18, and maybe this will help begin to explain this. 1 Peter 3.18. This incident here accounted for us in 1 Peter 3.18 is the exact incident prophesied in the psalm that Paul is talking about in Ephesians. Got it? Let's read. 318. For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, in order that he might bring us to God, having been put to death. Okay, where are we right now? We're at the cross. Where is Christ? Christ is dead. He has been put to death. Okay? The body is dead. He is dead in the flesh, but he's been made alive in the spirit, small s. Okay? Small s. Moving on, what happened then? And by the way, I'm sure you've asked, in fact, it wasn't a long time ago, I don't even remember who asked me this, someone came and asked me the question, Dave, what happened to Christ those three days that his body was in the tomb? Where did he go? It tells us right here, in which he also, he went and made proclamation to the spirits now present. You know what happened to him? He descended, Ephesians 4. When he died and his body was placed in the tomb, his spirit was alive, his body was dead, 1 Peter 3.18, but his spirit, smallest, the inner man, was alive. Where did he go? He descended. Oof. And it says here in 1 Peter 3, 19, that he descended to the spirits now in prison. So he went down to a prison. What is that? Let me explain. Where he went was simply this. He went to Hades. It's not hell. Hell is a New Testament concept. It's not hell. It's Hades. Now let me explain. Draw a circle in your mind. Okay, you got that? Got a circle? It doesn't have to be perfect. Don't worry. Just leave it alone. Just draw a circle in your mind. Now, draw a line across the middle. Okay? In Hades, there were two basic parts. There was a lower part in which those demons were bound up. And by the way, again, I don't want to go real deep because we could go forever here. But these are demons that God chained in relation to the judgment that he had upon the world when the world was flooded. And the demons that were responsible for the evilness and the wickedness of that day were bound up by God at that time. and they're in eternal change. We also know that there are demons that are alive and loose today too. But these were the ones who were bound. And also in that lower level of Hades were all the unrighteous people before the cross. But there was an upper level of Hades also. And that is where the righteous were. That is where the Old Testament saints were. Okay? You got the picture? The one who descended was Christ. He descended into that lower place. What did he do when he went there? Verse 19, He made proclamation to them. In the King James Version, it says, He went down there to the lower place, and He preached to them. Now, that really bothered me for a long time. I remember hearing vague kinds of references to this text, and I would think, well, that's really strange. I guess God knows what He's doing, but He went, what I thought it meant, He went down to Hades, and He preached the gospel to them, and it was kind of like giving them a second chance. And He went down there and preached, and every good preacher, especially Alliance, they'd give an invitation at the end, you know, and all these bad guys had come. second chance they didn't know about the cross so they get it now that sounds nice but it isn't what happened and the way i know is the greek word is real simple it isn't euangelizo euangelizo would would be the word that was used if he went down there to preach the good news to them the word that was used there is keruso and it means to proclaim something what he did was go and tell them the bad news is what he did he made a proclamation he descended into that lower level and looked at those demons and those unrighteous ones and said, no, what? You just saw the cross and it looked like a loser. But what Satan meant for evil, God meant for good. You lose. You lose. He made proclamation. He told them, to tell them what looked like defeat was really victory. He went to the demons and he went to the unrighteous and he said, the battle's done. The victory is won. And you lost. I got to tell you this. All week long as I was trying to picture in my mind what Jesus did when he went down there and it wasn't, you know, some warm, loving, hey, you know, want to come? It wasn't that at all. It was a proclamation. You lost. It was as if Jesus went down to the lower part and gave him the royal raspberries. You know, na, na, na, na, na, na. You lost. That's how bizarre my mind is. I'm sure he didn't do that. But you want to know something? It isn't all that far off. In Colossians 2.15, he says this. You know what he did when he went down there? Colossians 2.15 says he went down there to deal with the principalities and the powers. And you know what he did? He made public show of them. He made public display of them. Displaying to all the principalities and powers that you lost. And I won. But you know what happens then? The one who descended what? Is also the one who ascended, right? So he descends and he makes his proclamation. K. Russo, you lost. And then, then he begins his ascension. And he goes up through the upper part of that Hades. And he brings and he gathers to himself. He scoops up, as it were, all those Old Testament precious saints. And he brings them to his bosom. And he blows open the doors of Hades. And he's bringing them back up to the Father. Oh, I get goosebumps when I talk about that. You know what? Those Old Testament believers who were part of that wonderful reconciliation. You know, up until now, they didn't have the full, complete forgiveness of their sin, but Jesus won. He won. And then he brings them up, and he blows open the doors, and they start coming up with him. And I want to tell you something. We preach from time to time about what it means to be redeemed, don't we? To be bought out. You know what? Nobody had to explain to them what it meant to be redeemed. I think they sang all the way to heaven, I've been redeemed, set free. What a picture. And Paul is saying that one who descended is the one who ascended. And the one they're talking about there in Ephesians 4 who ascended the hill of Zion and is the great conqueror, that is Jesus Christ himself. That's who it is. And he led captivity captive, that's what it means. He brought those Old Testament saints, and he brought them to his bosom, and he brought them up into the Father's presence. Watch this. When Christ went to the cross, what he did was he entered into an awesome battle with Satan. And that battle looked like a loser, but he won. And now here comes Jesus Christ, the conquering hero, ascending the hill of victory, right? and just like in the psalm he's got two things with him right remember he's got two things with him the spoils of war that are rightfully his because the war has been won by him and the other thing he's got with him are the captives that he set free released to liberty as sons of god the redeemed and that includes you and me and i know what it means now as i look back at ephesians i want you to turn back there as i look back at ephesians we're picking this apart when he ascended on high Now I know that's Christ who's the great victor. He had two things. He led captive a host of captives. Now I understand that. Those are the believers that are brought to him and they're his people who he's bringing back. The enemy has no hold over them anymore. But the other thing is the spoils of war. And I don't understand that. What are the spoils of war? It says right there he gave gifts to men. You know what the spoils of war are? They're the gifts. They're the gifts. The spiritual gifts. What a picture I get. I love this. the conquering king comes up and he's marching up Zion and he comes to the top and everyone's hailing him as king and he has with him all those who are redeemed in one hand and just the whole pageantry of them singing I've been redeemed, I've been redeemed and on the other hand he's got all the trophies and the spoils of war and then he gets to the top and he looks at his people and he looks at his church and he says you know what I'm going to share with you the spoils I'm going to share with you the riches and I'm going to give gifts to men and it's going to build my body listen the cross of Christ has got to be bigger for some of us when Christ died he died on the cross to save you to redeem you but he also died on the cross so that he could enable you to serve him the price he paid for redemption is the same price he paid to grant you the gift. The gift. Do you think it's important to serve? Do you think it's important to use the gift? And you know what? I'm not telling you to try to discover your gift. I'm telling you to serve. You've got the gift. And he is going to express himself through you in a multiplicity of ways. But you've got to open the box and begin to serve. Paul goes on and I can't leave this here we got time again Christ is the conquering hero and he passes out the spoils remember the captives there were two kinds of captives there were those people who were bound and they were enemies and he brought them with to demonstrate they no longer had dominion and also those people who were in chains and he set them free two kinds of captives there's also two kinds of gifts the first kind of gift that he bestows and showers upon his church are the gifts that he gives to individuals. But there's another kind of gift that he gives to the church. And it's simply this, specific men. Specific men. These are gifts to the total body. Not to individuals, but to the total body. What are those gifts? Who are those people? Those gifts, those people are the apostles, they are the prophets, they are the evangelists, and they are the pastor teachers. They are the pastor teachers. And the best way I can describe it would be simply this, that Jesus, when he won that war and he defeated Satan and hell and death and all of his demons, and he brought with him all the booty of war, he brought with him trophies. Trophies, as it were, were these men. Were these men trophies? The apostles were a trophy that Christ won at the cross. He takes this trophy and as he's mounted and as he's climbed Mount Zion, he takes this trophy and he says, here, this is for the church. I'm going to give you apostles. and you know what they're going to do? They're going to lay the foundation of the church. I'm going to work through them in a special way and I'm going to give to them the doctrine of the church. Do you think we owe a debt of gratitude to the apostles? Oh, heavens. There isn't anybody in your whole life, I don't care how deeply you've been affected by a person here, there isn't anybody in your whole life that has had a more profound effect on your life probably than the apostles, the foundation layers, The ones to whom God gave that special thing, that inspiration to give us the Word of God. We are forever indebted to Christ's gift to us, the trophy that Christ won there. The prophets who spoke for God, the Word of God, took the precious writings that the apostles had and taught it to the early church, laying a foundation, the evangelists and the pastor teachers. You know, as I was thinking about this this week, I began to think in my mind, of the sense of the debt of gratitude that I owe to men who were trophies that God wanted to cross and gave to me and gave to you. Think all week long of the radio that you listen to when you hear the John MacArthur's and the Chuck Swindoll's. And I just get blown away when I think that those men, you know what, I think of my dad. I think of my dad and I love my dad and I've got a great relationship with him. And I always knew that he had a big impact on me. but now it's bigger than it ever was because I think of my dad as a trophy that Christ won at Calvary and then he gives it to the church and he says I'm going to give you this trophy because you need it to be built what a glorious picture what a glorious picture great battle at the cross Christ won he ascended the hill to Mount Zion and he brought with him my redemption and he also brought the trophies that he won gifts to individuals to build the body gifts to the church and they were individuals to establish it to lead it to build it to nourish it to sustain it why? so that we could be the body of Christ Christ's body you know what this is real big this is real big people Ephesians 7 through 11 such is the legacy of Christ to his church next week we are going to see the application and we are going to go even deeper into the gifts what I've done today is nothing more than lay a foundation for us to build upon with integrity and honesty and real bible content so that we can understand the function of the gifts two things that cause the church to be dynamic and to be the body and that is one the loving unity the fellowship and secondly that function that ministry of spiritual gifts let's pray father i I thank you for your gifts to the church how you've enabled us to be your body Father may you by the power of your spirit awaken in us stir up the gift that you've given Lord we so want to be your body Lord we so want to be a clear picture to the world of who you are and how you love and how you forgive continue to work in us in your name Amen Thank you.
