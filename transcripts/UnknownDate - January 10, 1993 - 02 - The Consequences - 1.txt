Acts 15, verse 20 is the basis of our study this morning. And I think most of you are aware of the fact that in the context of Acts 15, dealing with the final verdict of the Jerusalem Council, a word was given from the Apostle James to the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, to abstain from four things. Among them was fornication. The Greek word for fornication is the Greek word porneia, and it is one that a few weeks ago I indicated I would use interchangeably. Fornication, porneia, I just want you to know that they are the same. This issue of abstaining from fornication is not, quite frankly, the preoccupation of the text. It has become ours and will be for several weeks. I anticipate this word continuing at least through all of January and maybe spilling into a bit of February. Broadly defined, pornea is simply this. Sexual relations between a man and a woman outside the context of marriage, including such things as extramarital sex, premarital sex. It is clearly broader than that. But for our understanding to begin with, that's a place to start. Verse 20 says in our text, abstain from fornication. Verse 29 in our text says, abstain from fornication. For if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Let's pray as we continue our study this morning. Father, in each service it has built for me, and that is an awareness that there needs to be divine assistance to break the power of lies that we have long held true, specifically as it relates to what pornea is and how it has infected our minds and spirits and our bodies. And, Father, I pray that divine assistance would be here for me in making proclamation relative to what is truth against lies that have great power in our lives. I pray that all the workings of the evil one would be subdued. Your truth would reign. More than truth, I pray that power for healing would come among us, power that for many of us would be unthinkable and maybe unprecedented. Touching areas of our lives, I pray in Jesus' name that some of us didn't even know we needed to be touched in. Pray your work among us in your name. Amen. Reading from a book called Beyond Forgiveness by a man named Don Baker. The silence of my study was interrupted by the persistent ringing of the telephone. A long-time friend from a distant city was calling. I'm sorry Don but I have some bad news for you One of your people has been deeply involved in sin for many years The whole story is just beginning to surface here And I thought I'd call you so that you could deal with it before it comes to you second hand I listened as he described a long series of events with all the confirming evidence that was needed It was not just one of my people, it was one of my dear friends It was one of my staff that had fallen. When he finished, I replaced the phone, sat in stunned disbelief for a few moments, laid my head on my desk, and began to weep. The ringing telephone and faraway voice that early morning shattered more than the stillness of my quiet office, much more. My brother, my colleague in the ministry was leading a double life, and had been for many years. but now it was over and his world was about to come crashing down and so was ours and now we tell his wife but how does a man tell his loving wife that he's been unfaithful to her repeatedly over a period of 13 years not just any man but a christian man a christian minister whose total life had been committed to sharing and displaying the holy nature of a holy god a man whose position of trust had made such actions unthinkable, whose life had been used as a model for others? Well, I was about to learn the answer to that question. Diane was a little startled to see me at the door at that hour. Her apprehension grew noticeably as I told her that her husband was in the car and that we needed to talk where we could be alone and uninterrupted. She and Greg climbed into the rear seat of my car and sat in stunned silence. suddenly he broke into deep convulsive sobs, took Diane in his arms, buried his head in her shoulder and said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Diane said nothing. I've been unfaithful to you, he finally managed to say, unfaithful. I have been living a lie for 13 years with a number of women. I am so sorry and so ashamed. Diane stiffened momentarily and then, without a word, wrapped both arms tightly around her husband, drew him close to her, cradled him like a baby, and said, I can forgive you, Greg, I love you. Greg, I love you. Greg, I love you. But during the hours and days that followed, Diane's emotional anesthetic wore off. She experienced great anger, bitterness, and self-pity. Various incidents would come to mind that had always been remembered as wonderful and happy times with many of her close friends. As she recalled them carefully, she would realize that those happy occasions had often been used by her husband and her friends as opportunities for infidelity. Her contented past seemed to be more and more obscured with an ugly awareness that she had been deceived, betrayed, cheated, and wronged. The past 13 years blurred into one long nightmare as she saw Greg and his sin in every memory. She found herself turning even the most innocent events into ugly experiences until finally there were no longer any happy memories. Now that book is a book that speaks of amazing grace and wonderful healing that came to that family and to that church. But the excerpts of that book that I just read raises a question for me. It's this. Why are the consequences for things such as this so very high? Some of you have considered that question in the past. It almost seems at times unfair, somehow disproportionate. disproportionate, as if there is no sin more grievous than sexual sin. It is somehow in a category all by itself. Some would even protest, saying, better for him to have committed murder than this, as far as how we look at things like this. Some would indeed and do argue that the real source of pain as it relates to our sexuality and our behavior is not at all in the behavior but rather in the value system that we hold that is entirely unrealistic. Some indeed do argue that we have put such a premium on things like fidelity and chastity, purity and integrity, that when those things are lost, the pain is much greater than it really needs to be. The solution, therefore, being lower our expectations, change our values. Welcome to the 90s, Dave. Everybody's doing it. If not right now, everybody will. It is a normal thing. It's a biological function. It's a physical expression. We really need to lighten up about this sex thing. Okay? Okay, so maybe it really is a problem with our values, and we need to change our values to match our behavior, and we'll all be much happier. Then what do I do with things like this? A letter I received after the last sermon on this just a few weeks ago, among many letters, this one with permission to share, cataloging in her life the pain of pornea. Thank you for giving me a hook to hang much of my life experience and job stress on. That is this phrase, the pain of pornea. Briefly, let me share. It was in the pain of pornea that my father became the hero in an incestuous family and was called to the mission field, the mission field where he continues his, his as underlined, work for God. dad took the family pain with him and continues to pass it on even today but for god's healing grace through open door since 1998 since 1986 i would now be dead the missionary kids support group has been god's arms around me this past year and i've continued painful recovery from abandonment and abuse it was the pain of pornea that led me into a sexual relationship with my instructor in college, a physician who took me to be his mistress. This relationship gave me a false but short-lived sense of belonging. Guilt from that then led me to seduce my future husband into premarital sex just to be sure he wouldn't be able to tell that I wasn't a virgin when we married. Six years ago, I confessed my secret sin, and over time I have found forgiveness from God, from my husband, and finally I have found it for myself. Indeed, it was the pain of pornea that drove my compulsivity, bulimia, work addiction, secular and church work, and my codependency. Burnout and severe depression were the fruits of this fine missionary daughter's exemplary external performance, which was held up as a model for all to emulate. I'm a health care provider for women today. Only today do I see that it is, ironically, the pain of pornea that pays my wages. Daily I see, hear, and feel the pain of pornea in women and children. Let me share some examples. There is the 32-year-old woman who has wanted a baby since age 16 and is now pregnant. I tell her, however, that she has genital herpes and genital warts. Her only sexual partner has been her husband. After years of lying, he admits to being with a prostitute in the Philippines, and now she wants an abortion. The wounded 13-year-old girl has multiple sexually transmitted diseases, admits that all of her partners have been older men with tears. Or how about the lesbian who gets a man at work to father her child? She gets more than she asked for, however. Both of them are incest victims and bring all of that into this union. A wonderful mother pregnant with her sixth child who has nightmares that fetal parts were left inside her with her last abortion. At five months, we discover she is HIV positive. The risk of fetal transmission is 30% from her perspective. Odds are in her favor. But I come alongside her and see the agony of guilt, fear, and shame. After the birth of a beautiful baby girl, we wait three to six months for the baby to develop AIDS. I then hear her wonder how long the disease will be held at bay and who will care for her children after her death. Or the precious black pregnant teen who drinks heavily, trying to push away the pain. For her, the pain was the pain of pornea and rejection. He left me, she said. He wanted the baby, but he left. I know this doesn't sound nice, but if he doesn't care about this baby, why should I? A 22-year-old in filthy clothes reeks of old urine. The nurse describes the smell and gags. I pause before going into the room and ask God for a gift. After explaining the exam procedure, I ask permission to proceed and promise to stop at her request, for this is her body. Later, her mother calls and tells me that this exam was wonderful. No one hear this. No one had ever asked permission to do anything to her before. They just... She is mentally slow, you see, and her problem made him look bad. Last year, a sexual relationship condoned in a group home resulted in pregnancy. Six months ago, this precious child was raped in her own bedroom by her roommate's boyfriend. While she has always wet her bed, now she doesn't clean it up. It's her only way to protect herself from rape. She has no support system, and she doesn't know Jesus. I could fill the pages. Every 10 to 20 minutes, I see another patient. Most of them have been wounded by the pain of porneia. So let's change our values and it'll fix all that. See, it all raises the question again. Why are the consequences for things such as this so high? But now more questions come in light of the letter. questions like this. From where, dear God, have we fallen? How, dear Jesus, have we descended into this kind of thing? And Jesus, would you please begin to communicate to us as those who love you and believe in you as a church? How do we, in light of these kinds of things, put on the brakes. Another question, scary question, Lord, would it do any good if we did? Or has something been... I hear echoes in my mind again, all this is, Dave, is sex. All it is is sex. It's just this physical thing, a biological urge. It's like eating and drinking. My mind and spirit get filled with questions. In light of the lies that people believe about their sexuality, what possible difference could one voice make, one sermon make, one health care giver make? What kind of impact could one church have to stem the tide, to heal the land? Do we dare ever hope to believe that any of this stuff, this pornea, can by God really be reclaimed? Do we dare hope to believe that any of this can by God be restored and redeemed? Or should we, even those of us who believe in Jesus, relent, admit and acknowledge that quite frankly, The best that we can hope for, the most help that we can offer to deal with the danger and the pain of pornea is to hand out condoms. There is your hope. There is your safety. There is your sanity. That is the help we have to offer. Dave face it they're going to do the deed it's an itch we've got to scratch it's a biological urge a physical necessity if everybody's going to do it anyway at least tell them to wear a condom I agree if we all have to do it do that but again the question just keeps ringing in my head Is that the best that we can do? Is that the most hope we have to offer? Is that the most that we can say? Is that the only hope we have to give? I hope not. But now enter in with me to the frustration and tension of answering this question. In light of the sea of porneia within which we swim and have been affected by even those of us in the church, my question is this. Where on earth do we begin to stem the tide to heal the land? Well, I have a place. I don't know that it's the best place. I don't know that it's the most important place. It's just this place I've landed on, and it's this. We will begin somehow, to the best of our ability, to identify and expose lies, and into those lies inject some truth. into the face of lies, throw some truth, and see maybe if the truth has any power to counteract the lies. Lie number one, and this is the only lie I'm going to have time to deal with today. Lie number one is this. Our sexuality involves nothing more than a biological urge. That is a lie. Our sexuality involves nothing more, touches nothing more, than a physical function. Our sexuality involves nothing more than genital expression. For what it's worth, I am here to say out loud, that is a lie. Not only do I believe it is a lie, I believe that that lie is a demonically empowered lie. It is a strongly held lie It is a militantly believed lie. Even in the community of the redeemed, it is a lie that is believed by many. Dare I say most? I don't know. It is, in my opinion, a lie that needs to be compared to because it is a stronghold of the evil one that mere words cannot bring down. I do not have any naive hope that words I'm saying will break the stronghold, the power of the lie. All that this can do is expose the lie. This lie needs to be, certainly is in my mind, in the category of things we fight against, revealed to us in Ephesians 6. Not flesh and blood, but our struggle is against principalities and powers, rulers, world forces of this darkness, spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. I believe that this lie about sexuality, having only to do with physical expression, that's all it is, is a lie that has all the force and sanction of hell behind it. and sermons like this don't have the power to break it only to expose it first or second timothy chapter 10 verse 3 says this we need to know that we do indeed walk in the flesh that is we walk in the sphere of the physical but we also need to know that we do not war according to the flesh, but the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but they are mighty through God. They are divinely powerful, and divine power is what brings down the strongholds. That is what destroys the fortresses. Let me ask you a question in light of that. If I'm right about this lie as it relates to our sexuality, being limited only to physical expression as being a demonically empowered lie, if demonically empowered strongholds are brought down only by the power of God. Here's my question. Do any of you pray when I preach? Do you? I know that some of you do. If you do, pray now. With this in view, no matter what Dave says today, it will not break the power of the lie. Holy Spirit, come in power to set us free from the ways we've been lied to and defiled. the way God we recognize demons empower lies we pray today that angelic hosts would be released empowering the truth that the truth would begin to rise and have as much power in our lives as the lies have because the lies surely have had power here is the truth truth number one thrown into the face of the lie our sexuality in its essence is not physical our sexuality in its essence is not biological in its essence our sexuality is spiritual now i don't know how you react to that initially some of you might feel something powerful resonate in your spirit. There's a yes. Others of you, that truth just kind of bounces off like a little nothing against this lie. Hang with me here. In its expression, our sexuality is physical. In its expression, Our sexuality clearly is biological. It is genital. But in its essence, at the core, I want you to consider with me, inject even for a moment, if you will, into that view that all it is is genital. That's all that's being touched. The idea, let it in just for a minute, that maybe there's more to it than physical. There's a spiritual dimension. If I'm right about that, that our sexuality at its core is spiritual, indeed, before it ever becomes physical, it is spiritual, something close to my spirit, indeed my soul, then what that means is this, that when I enter into sexual activity, express my sexuality physically, but my sexuality has spiritual dimensions, then when I express it physically, something more than physical stuff is being touched. Maybe if there is a spiritual component, something spiritual is being released, something in my spirit is being touched, more than genitals touching, something in my spirit is being affected. Just throw that up against the other view. Now, if I'm right about that, that our sexuality begins in the spirit, has spiritual dimensions, more than just skin to skin, then maybe that does explain the question I began the sermon with. Why are the consequences so high? Maybe the reason, just maybe, the reason the consequences are so high is because something other than skin to skin is being touched when we engage in sexual activity. Maybe it even explains why things like rape are so much more damaging, take so much longer to recover from than getting shot with a gun or stabbed with a knife. Why? Because maybe in our sexuality, even in the vilest form that we can think of, that being rape, Something more than physical stuff has been touched. Something deep in our spirit, something close to our soul that is too marvelous and wonderful for any of us to fully understand. But we feel the consequences of it when we move outside the parameters of sexuality as God has designed it for us. I've thought of this long and I thought, boy, we deal with sexual abuse victims so long, so hard. The memory is buried for years. Why is it so grievous? Why is it sometimes seem bigger? Maybe it's because something other than somebody's physical essence was touched. When this truth is denied, and this truth is denied, that there is no spiritual dimension to our sexuality, then all we have left is the physical. All we have left is the genital. The result of that is this, a lifelong quest for the ultimate experience, because all it is is physical. That's where I'm going to fully experience my sexuality in the physical expression, so I'm on a quest. If it is only physical, I am going to be on a lifelong quest for the best technique, for the perfect partner. And I have wonderful hope that it might be you are the perfect. No, it's not you. Well, if it's not you, that's okay. Maybe it's you. And if it's not you, maybe it's you or you or... Maybe it's not a woman at all. Maybe I can find this incredibly fulfilling physical experience with a man. Maybe it's not with a man. Maybe it's with a child. And if all it is is physical, and I am going to gratify it at that level only, maybe, maybe I can find it in an animal. And into that kind of thinking, I throw Romans chapter 1, verse 22 and following, which says, among other things, this, professing to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the truth of God for a lie. And among the truths of God that they rejected, first of all, they rejected God, but the truth of God, among other things that they rejected, was that sexuality has no bearing on my spirit or my soul. It's just a physical thing. God gave them over. Saying many things, one truth I want you to get, whether you even believe it or not, understand it or not, our sexuality is deeper than physical expression. It is a spiritual union. Indeed, sexual, physical expression is the final act on a continuum of spiritual realities of people being blended together. Finally expressing itself in sexuality. Physical sexuality. Turn in your Bibles to 1 Corinthians 6 to see some of this concept borne out in the Word of God. I want you to know that next week we're going to deal with this passage as the basis of our thinking. I'm going to go deeply into the text and explain some of the mysteries of it, some of the confusing terminology. Powerful word today. Just kind of get a flavor for it and see where it does illustrate what I'm trying to say. Sexuality is more than physical. Start in verse 13. Interesting to me, Paul here is confronting the same lie 2,000 years ago that I am today. That lie being that sex is just physical like eating and drinking. Verse 13. Food is for the stomach, Paul says. And stomach is for the food, but God will do away with both. Meaning food and stomach stuff is temporal. Yet the body is different. One way the body is different is that it is not for immorality. Stop right there. Let's go back to this food and stomach thing. The food, when it says it's for the stomach and stomach is for the food, means this, that the food and stomach were made for each other. you follow that say it this way consistent with the design of the stomach is food so go ahead and eat whatever poison would be a bad idea but eat food let me add to that this as long as we're talking about sexuality and that's what this passage is dealing with consistent with the design of the body both male and female consistent with the design of the body is sexuality absolutely But this passage says, inconsistent with the design of the body is pornea. Where do you see that? Yet the body is not for, was not designed for immorality. It was designed for sexuality, but not for pornea. Simply as I can put that, as if we were machines. If I was an engine, a car engine, you got to put oil in that machine. If I decide to pour water in there, it's not going to run well. You decide to pour pornea in, express yourself in pornea, you're not going to run well. We're going to have letters like this. You weren't designed for it. Why? Well, for one reason, we were made for a sexual experience that involves more than the physical. See the same thing in verse 16. Do you not know that the one who joins himself to a harlot is one body with her? The two will become, he says, one flesh. I'm going to get into that next week. Whatever else that means, you know what it communicates to me? I've got to step back and go, whoa, maybe if that's true, there is something more to sexuality than skin to skin. It says right there, there is more to it than that. There is a one flesh thing that happens. There is more than physical experience. There is a spiritual union. And whether you acknowledge that or not, understand that or not, that's a real thing. And you will experience the consequences of violating that whether you know it or not, whether you believe it or not. Verse 17 goes as far as to compare this union between a man and a woman with our union to Christ. That's a bit much, isn't it? But the Lord, but the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with him. Right in the same context of this other picture of a man joining himself to a woman is this picture of Jesus joining himself and we joining ourselves to him. Ephesians 5 makes the same parallel. It says this in Ephesians 5 verse 31. For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, the two, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two will come together and become one flesh. This mystery is great. I love that. I'm very glad it's called a mystery. that means it is beyond my capacity to describe and I feel great frustration in trying to describe the glory of this and the reason is because it's a mystery but then he says but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church in Ephesians 5 there is this comparison made between the wonder and glory of the union of a man and a woman becoming one flesh comparing that to the wonder and glory of Christ and his church whatever else that means the depths of which we cannot plumb. It means this. There's something about my sexuality that goes beyond skin to skin. Wouldn't you agree? If you believe the word of God, it says that. And this mystery is great. More than a mystery, I think it is a wonder. It is a glory. And it is one that from time to time, I think that we do get a glimpse of. Genesis 5, I believe, gives us such a glimpse. This wonder, this glory, and please hear me, it is but a glimpse. A snapshot, if you will. The kind of thing from time to time you get in the context of worship, where in the middle of it you get a glimpse of glory. The glimpse, the glory of this one flesh relationship, what God designed is seen first in creation. And by the way, I think we are so affected by porneia, we've got to go back to the beginning to get a flavor of it, to get a feel for it. Chapter 5, verse 1, this is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day when God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. He created them, male and female. He blessed them and named them man. Now stop right there. He named them, that is male and female, man. Go back up into verse 1. You need to see this. The man word here is plural. In the day when God created man, plural, meaning man and woman, he made him, plural, man and woman, in the likeness of God. Man and woman come together is the likeness of God. Keep that in your hopper. Genesis chapter 1, verse 26 says much the same thing. Interesting. Then God said, let us make man, plural man, man and woman, in our image, according to our likeness. And let them, that is, man and woman, one flesh, rule over the fish of the sea, birds of the sky, cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. And God created man, plural word, man and woman, in his own image. And in the image of God, he created him, plural, man and woman. Think on that. Now, when Adam was created, and out of Adam, Adam, by the way, picture this, was one flesh because he was just one guy. But in him was male and female. Out of him was taken the woman. And he looked at her. And I love his response to this created woman that came from his flesh. this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she's taken out of the man and for this cause for this cause of man, man and woman a man shall leave his father and mother, shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become again one flesh. Adam one flesh created woman. Looking at her we come together to create Once again, one flesh. Now, I love Adam's response to the created woman. It's the accurate perception. It's a major confrontation on how we view women and how women view men. But my biggest interest right now in light of this is not Adam's response, but what God saw when he saw man and woman together. What God saw, according to the text, was his likeness. What God saw, according to the text, was the coming together of male and female, all that is male and all that is female coming together. In that union, he saw his image. He saw his glory. The best picture of God is not seeing God as male and it is not seeing God as female. The best picture of God, if it is something we can ever feature because we can't, we get a glimpse of it when you picture that which is male coming together in harmony with that which is female. And in that blending of the two, there is the likeness of God. There is the glory of God. There is the image born there. Now, one of the questions I was asked about this thing is, where does this leave us singles? I mean, we're not part of this. Yes, you are. Let me tell you how. Please be patient with me here because I can't peel all the layers off of this. But the way I can best enter all of us into this is this. When I, as a married man, come together with my wife in a physical union, it is a physical expression, way down the line, by the way, of spiritual union that happened a long time ago, physically expressing, and in a metaphor, in a picture, we physically come together picturing a spiritual union that hopefully took place before this physical thing ever happened. But you know what? While I can in some ways get a picture through this metaphor of sexuality, of the male and the female coming together, therein being the image of God, in another arena, when the male and female comes together, they produce something which is the product of fully male and fully female. Separate from my wife. My wife separate from me. As an individual, I bear the image by myself this way, consistent with the metaphor. There was a man who came together with a woman, created this union, produced this male-female expression called me, called you. Image of God in that arena as well. The physical expression of this wonder, this mystery, is when a husband and a wife come together and express that sexually, But it is way down the line of what the spiritual realities of that physical manifestation are. And we have lost the body of our sexuality because we have lost our spirituality. And all it is is about genitals and skin to skin. And we have fallen badly. And when I say it like this, I don't know if you are making all the connections. It took me a long time, and it'll take you some time as well. I hope you are pregnant with some of these things through these weeks even, and let them develop in your mind. But whatever else this communicates, this picture communicates that the coming together of a man and a woman is more than physical, it is spiritual. that reflects the image, and that violation of that is more than bad behavior. It strikes at the image. It strikes at the image. It diminishes the glory, and it touches in ways that we do not understand our spirit, and it touches our soul. And that is why, beloved, the consequences are high. By the way, as I get into this spiritual picture of our sexuality, of union between male and female, it occurs to me that our fallenness, our defiling of male and female, is defiled long before we get to the behaviors we want to stop. It occurs to me that defilement is manifested in attitudes we have toward one another, men who hate women. Before you ever do a thing, men who hate women, who use them or would like to use them, objectify them, despise them, belittle them, is so far from what God created for us in the beginning of the coming together of one flesh, from one flesh, back to one flesh, to despise that peace. Before behavior is done, we've fallen. Women who hate men, who would use them, objectify them, despise them, and belittle them. How far we have fallen from one flesh in the spirit, the spirit of a man or a woman. I asked the question at the beginning. I closed with the same question. in light of this grand purpose of God of one flesh and male and female and all that is male and female coming together in this spiritual union that is the image of God it is so pristine and grand and beyond words the question in light of letters like I read is can any of this be reclaimed? Can any of this be redeemed? Can any of this be restored? If I keep reading letters like this, I'm going to think not, won't you? If some of you look at your own heart and your own pain, some of you are going to think not. There's no way to restore what I've lost, some of you would think. But could I say this, the simplest truth, again, a truth that all I can do, All I can do today is throw the truth up into the face of the lie. To redeem and restore and reclaim, beloved, is why our redeemer and reclaimer and restorer became a man and laid down his life and raised it up again so that we could be redeemed and reclaimed and restored, and not just in salvation so when we die we go to heaven, but that the dimensions of our humanity could somehow be reclaimed and restored, that the fullness of my masculinity could by the power of the Spirit be reclaimed, that the fullness of your femininity could somehow by the power of the Spirit be restored and reclaimed. Is that a pot? Do we dare believe that God can restore what the enemy has defiled? I believe that the strongholds in this arena are so big and have been with us so long that a sermon about this has no power to bring it down, only to expose it. It occurs to me that nothing short of the very breath of God that created us in the beginning could come and recreate some of these things in us for wholeness, that buckets of grace and rivers of mercy, an opening of the heavens for healing is what we need and need to ask for, that angelic hosts need to come the way we would acknowledge demonic presences from time to time being among us that we would ask and acknowledge for angelic hosts to right now come and break the power of the lies. And after the lies are broken, that the heavens would open for healing and that things like purity and chastity and virginity, things that we have lost long ago, could be by the Spirit reclaimed, redeemed, restored. Is that possible? I'll just say this about that. it's why we're here it's why we're here it's why we're here it's all it's the only reason we're here it's not because of good music and some guy who tells jokes this isn't funny it's about a God in heaven who is alive and has created us for purpose and has paid an enormous price for our redemption of our souls but longs to give us more reclaim for us our humanity reclaim for us our dignity Holy Spirit come Holy Spirit come in all three services I have been frustrated with how to close I don't know how to close but I think I know how to close actually it's not with a song I want you to stand here's the deal we have all been wounded every one of us have been wounded every one of us have the mark on us of the evil one in one capacity or another in terms of fallen from what we've been created for and that puts all of us in the same position of needing to get a touch from the spirit of God to reclaim some of this for us one of the biggest lies some of you are getting right now So men would be this, that having been defiled, men, and then moving from being defiled to defiling in your behavior, the pain of porneia in your life, men, has so infected you that you believe now that there is no way to restore, no way to reclaim, no way to redeem. Women, you believe the same lie. Having been defiled by porneia in one way or another, you are now in one way or another defiling, and now the lie that's come to you is that the pain of porneia has so infected you that there is no way to restore you, reclaim you, or redeem you in that area. My saying it more isn't going to bring it either, so I'm going to ask the Spirit to come. Altar ministry, I want you to come to the front. People who need to come for prayer, you come. Another thing that's happened in all three services is that we've, I've just acknowledged that this issue is so broad that if everyone who came, who needed prayer came to the front, we would be overwhelmed. We want you to come to the front, but I'm going to ask the Spirit to mobilize us to pray for each other as well. Let's pray. Jesus, I pray that your Holy Spirit would come. Pray that your Holy Spirit in ways that we would be amazed by would just come and move among us. Your word says that if my people who are called by my name would humble themselves and seek my face, I'll hear their voice from heaven and I will come to them and heal their land. Come heal our land. I pray in Jesus' name for our men who have been defiled and are defiling, who have lost hope in being restored and renewed and reclaimed in this arena. I pray in your name that you would come with power, the energy of the Spirit, and bring hope and healing. I pray for the women among us who have been defiled and are now defiling, who have been wounded by the lies and the activity of the evil one and their own choices, and have lost all hope of ever being reclaimed or redeemed or made new in this arena of their life. And we call that in Jesus' name a lie. but we are helpless to bring it down. Divine power is what we need to break the fortresses and strongholds and the chains that bind us. You are our deliverer. Be today for us our deliverer now. Set your people free. Restore, redeem, reclaim Name our identities as men and as women. Sanctify us. Make us whole. Bring your glory back. In Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
