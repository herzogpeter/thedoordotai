This evening, the way that we're going to switch gears is that I'm going to be talking to you more like you're the person who's going to help the person in despair, and just giving you some insights into that. We'll get back to Job, mostly Job next week. But this week is more for helpers and being able to minister to people who are experiencing grief or who are experiencing a lot of emotional pain or from some loss or some kind of trauma in their life. So let's begin with a word of prayer and then we'll get going. Father, I want to thank you for this opportunity to serve you. I just give this time to you. I pray that you would use it, that your spirit would be here in power, that you would use this time and this material to touch our hearts, to equip us to do ministry with other people that looks like you doing the ministry, that you would use this time and what we learn to draw us and others close to you. In Jesus' name, amen. A little bit of a review about Job. situation with Job as you know as he experienced an incredible loss and we heard about that the first week in chapter 2 verse 11 Job's three friends come and they do it right while they're still in chapter 2 then something changes in chapter 3 chapter 2 verse 11 says now when Job's three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him they came each one from his own place, Elphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuite, and so far the Namathite. And they made an appointment together to come and sympathize with him and comfort him. And when they lifted up their eyes at a distance, they didn't recognize him. They raised their voices and wept, and each of them tore his robe. They threw dust over their heads toward the sky. They sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights, with no one speaking a word, for they saw that his pain was very great. What happens is that, evidently what happens, is that the fact that they saw what great pain that Job was in, and they came and just sat with him and were with him, their presence communicated something to Job, and I think what it communicated to Job was permission to have the pain that he had. It's one thing to have the pain, but it's another thing to be able to have it in front of somebody, and that's a little bit different, and it's more difficult, and especially if you're not sure that when you do put this pain out in front of people, they're still going to be okay with you, or they're not going to reject you, or they're not going to put some kind of formula on you. And evidently, Job got the message that these guys were safe, and he could really be in as much pain as he was in. But what happens is that there's a change. If you look at chapter 3, and basically chapters 3, 4, and 5, Job is kind of begging or pleading, and then something changes, and in chapter 6 he gets really defensive toward his friends who are trying to help. And I want to show you what I think some of the changes were. in chapter 4, verse 1, Eliphaz the Temanite says, If one ventures a word with you, will you become impatient? That's a setup. That's really manipulative for him to say that because now if Job does get impatient, Job is supposed to say, No, I won't get impatient. You can say whatever you want. And then this guy can say abusive things to him and then Job's not able to confront it because he's told him ahead of time it wouldn't bother him. That's kind of a setup there. Eliphaz is trying to get permission to say anything he wants to say without being able to be confronted for it. That's what it feels like to me. But who can refrain from speaking, he says. So what he's saying, basically, is even if you didn't want me to say it, I have to say this because I just care about you so much and I just feel so strongly about this. So even if I ask permission and you say, no, I need to say this anyway, that's kind of what he's doing. Behold, you have admonished many and you have strengthened weak hands. Your words have helped the tottering to stand. You have strengthened feeble needs, and now it has come to you, and you are impatient. Now, that's really a shaming kind of thing. In other words, you've known what to do and what to tell other people. What you've said has been helpful, and it's kind of like, why can't you just take your own advice? That's basically what he's saying. Shame on you for feeling this pain and having this struggle. You should know how to deal with this, because you've helped other people deal with this very same thing. Job's response, or not Job's response. In chapter 5, verse 8, here's the solution that Eliphaz gives Job. But as for me, I would seek God. In other words, you and God probably just aren't close enough, and that would really solve this, and so if you just did that, this would be over. I would seek God, and I would place my cause before God. As you're going to see, actually later on it's ironic, but Job does finally say, why don't you three guys just get out of here? I don't even want to listen to you anymore. And he does go to God and place his cause before God. But this is kind of like, turn it over to the Lord. I think you should just give it to the Lord. And a lot of times, I think when people say that, if you have an issue and someone says, I think you need to just give it to the Lord, a lot of times what that means is just don't give it to me. Just give it to the Lord, and I don't want to hear about this. And I'll tell you a little bit later why sometimes we don't want to hear about it. So anyway, in chapter 8, verse 1, it's the next guy's chance to shame Job. He says, And Bildad the Shoei answered, How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a mighty wind? Does God pervert justice? He's the official defender of God, and he's the one who's going to make sure that Job doesn't say any nasty things about God or get the wrong idea about God. Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right? If your son sinned against him, then he delivered them into the power of their transgression. What he's saying is, I can make sense of all this, Now, if you remember the very first session when we talked and when Dave introduced it, there is no sense to this. This is something that's going on between God and the devil. And Job is just in this. But he's saying, I can make sense of this. If your sons got killed, they must have deserved it. As if everybody who ever does anything gets what they deserve from God. Okay? Which isn't true. And what also isn't true is that some people get what they don't deserve from God, and some people don't get what they do deserve. The rain falls on the just and the unjust. And I don't get that. If you want to read someone struggling with that, read Psalm 73, where David is looking around, and he's saying, Look, I did it right, and all kinds of terrible things are happening to me, and these guys over here are a mess, and they're doing it wrong, and you're blessing them, and what's going on? I'm even jealous of them. I wish I had it as good as they did. I think I probably did it right for nothing. That's kind of what Psalm 73 is about. And he comes to the conclusion, though, that the answer is all these people that are sinning and perverting God's ways that things are going okay for are on a slippery place, and it could fall down any minute. So you just don't ever know when that's going to happen, and God really does. They will get what they have coming, and so will I, but it might not be right now. This guy is shaming Job once again for having all the pain and is almost acting like if you can make sense of the pain, then you don't have the pain. And I know people, I have seen people in counseling who are scrambling around like crazy trying to make sense of the pain, trying to find the reason why they're in so much pain. And what I found by watching them through the process is when they finally get to the place where they make sense of the pain they still have the pain. Making sense of the pain doesn't make the pain go away. Looking on the bright side or counting your blessings doesn't make the pain go away. Looking on the bright side or counting your blessings, I mean, if I was an incredible amount of pain and someone said that to me, I could find blessings to count. I could find all kinds of bright side over here. And when you finally do that inventory and find the bright side and count the blessings, All that means is that now you have all the pain and all the blessings both at the same time. The bright side does not cancel out the pain. It's okay to take that inventory, you know, because that's what's real. But when you're all done, the bright side and the blessings do not cancel out the pain. It's not like some balance scale where you have all this pain on this side, and if you could just toss enough positive stuff on the other side, the pain would go away. It doesn't work that way. The way it works is you just end up having both then. The solution to this is in verse 5, Bildad's solution to Job, verse 5, if you would seek God and implore the compassion of the Almighty. So just turn it over to God. Why are you saying these things? I don't want to hear these things. I think you should just go tell God. Chapter 11, verse 1, is the next person's turn. So far the name of thight answered, shall multitude of words go unanswered, and a talkative man be acquitted? Shall you boast, silence, miss? In other words, I have to speak, okay? I mean, this needs an answer, and I'm the official spokesman, and I'm going to answer your questions. Shall you scoff and then rebuke? For you have said my teaching is pure, and I am innocent in your eyes. But would that God might speak and open his lips against you and show you the secrets of wisdom. See, it's almost like this is the one who knows how God is supposed to operate with Job to fix the situation. This is the one who knows how God does it. well, see, the problem with the one who knows how God does it is usually that person's God, if you know what I mean by that. There's kind of this story of a Hindu king and seven blind guys, and it was like, what does an elephant look like? They're trying to find out what an elephant looks like, and one blind guy takes the elephant by the trunk, you know, and says elephants are like snakes, And then the next blind guy grabs the tail and says, elephants are like ropes. And the next person grabs the foot, the leg, and says, elephants are like trees. And it goes on and on. All these different people have a different piece. And then the Hindu king, the all-wise person, says, well, really, they're all right. See? Because elephants are like all those things, and so nobody's wrong. And that's the end of the story. The problem is that there is one person in the story who does know all the pieces, okay? and that's the Hindu king. And actually, this is a Hindu story about world religions. And so what it means about world religions is that Christianity isn't wrong, it's right, but they just have a piece. And Buddhism, it's not wrong, but it just has a piece. Everybody has their little piece, but there is one person in the story who's got all the pieces, and that's the Hindu king. Well, this is the person who really knows all the pieces, they know how God needs to do it, they know what God needs to say, They know what Job needs to hear in order for this to go away. And in verse 13, it says, If you would direct your heart right and spread out your hand to him, turn it over to God, this will be okay. Turn it over to God. These are really clear examples to me of ways that they're not wanting to hear what Job has to say. And I think there are some reasons why we have a problem when people have pain. and I'll get into them right now, some of the reasons why we struggle when somebody else has pain. A lot of us who try to help people in pain try to help too much. It's almost like there's a sense that we're responsible to make more happen here than we're actually capable of making happen. And so we try too hard, we try too much. And what happens then is that if you come to me and you're in pain and I think that I'm supposed to know what to say, or I'm supposed to know what to do to fix this or to ease your pain, then the fact that you're having this pain all over in front of me, what that does moves me out of my comfort zone. Your pain moves me out of my comfort zone. And if I give you the help that I give you in order to fix you and get your pain to be gone so that when your pain is gone, I move back into my comfort zone, then my help is not designed to help you, it's designed to help me. Can you follow that, how that works? a perfect example of that would be a rule that I had in our marriage, early on in our marriage, and I may have told you about this already, but I had this rule that said that good husbands always know what to say when their wives are sad. I believed that. That's what I thought. So Holly would come to me and she'd say, I'm really sad. And then that would bang up. That would move me out of my comfort zone. And the reason it would move me out of my comfort zone is because I had this rule that said good husbands are always supposed to know what to say when their wives are sad, and I didn't know what to say. So now I'm really uncomfortable. So what I would do is I would pretend to know what to say, and I would give her all this help and just keep coming at her with all these different things, trying to fix her sadness, because if her sadness was fixed, then I wasn't breaking my rule by not knowing what to say. See, then everything was okay. I moved back into my comfort zone, and now the help I gave her wasn't to help her, it was to help me. But it looks like helping. It's taking that looks like giving, is what it is. And it's really hard. It's hard to spot if you're just watching from the outside. It's really a hard issue for the person who's helping. A lot of times when you get into a counseling degree program, like at St. Thomas or St. Kate's or St. Mary's or the university, one of the reasons why they have an internship, out of the many reasons why they have internships, is because they want to put people in a helping capacity so that they can see if the person is helping out of fullness and all the help is for the helpee, or if the person is helping because that's how they get help for themselves. If they're going to go off and fix all the alcoholics in the world because they grew up in an alcoholic family and spent their whole life trying to fix their parents and never could, and now they go get a degree to help somebody else and try to help them. That's taking that looks like giving. And the problem is that in the end, you can't help everybody, and not everybody gets well, and not everybody likes what you say, or takes your advice, or lets in the help. And so if you have this idea that you're supposed to help everybody, or you're supposed to know what to say, and you come out, and not everybody gets well, it feels like a shame on you, and people burn out of the ministry that way. Because it's an unrealistic kind of thing that you're trying to live up to. It's taking that looks like giving. Another thing that happens a lot of times in helping is the way that we have learned to help where we've grown up. Now, I talk a lot about shame-based family systems, and I'll give you a really condensed version of this, how this works, but it would be like people with needs, needy people, who learn to do all the full right behavior on the outside and kind of attract each other for two reasons. One is that all these needs look over here and see all this full behavior, all that good behavior, and these needs see all this full behavior, and that's a really attractive thing, you know. I mean, when you're dating someone or you're engaged to someone, you're cranking out the best stuff you can crank out. Like when Holly used to visit me in the dorm room at Bethel, once a week it was clean, because I could do that once a week if someone was looking. That's a good behavior in clean room cell when you're courting someone. But if I'm doing the clean room to try to get that relationship and earn her approval, once I get the relationship and get the approval, I don't need to do the clean room anymore. Do you understand? And since that clean room was totally inconsistent with what was real on the inside, which is that I'm a slob, then as soon as I didn't have to do that anymore, it went away. The surprise was that she was kind of doing the same thing as I was doing, and so now we're in a mess. Now we're trying to teach our kids cleaning skills, and we don't have very many. We're having to learn this ourselves from scratch. The point is that the dynamics, and the second reason why this is attractive is because people have been taught to pay attention to outside stuff and not ask, why is somebody acting this way? Why are they doing this? it's just as possible to get a really full behavior, a really positive full behavior out of very negative motives as it is to get a negative behavior out of negative motives. And we haven't been taught to ask motive kinds of questions and heart kinds of questions. We've been taught how things look is the most important thing, and if we look out here and things look pretty good, we're happy. Well, since all this full behavior is not a genuine expression of what's really going on, it starts to deteriorate after a while people start to run out of gas. And so a lot of messages come in this relationship that say, I'm not okay and it's because of you and you need to perform harder. And of course that doesn't work. But people try and try and try. After a while, they give up on this and the thing blows apart or else they keep trying hard. They don't get tired. But sometimes what happens is they have a little kid. And in a healthy, functional family, the adults are there to meet the needs of the kids, in the sense that they're there to tell the kids that they're loved and accepted and capable and valuable and worthwhile, not alone, without strings. It's not about performance. It's a gift about who you are as a person and keeping performance and behavior separate from identity and acceptance as a human being. But in this family, the parents' needs aren't met, so then what happens is they look at this child who has to now perform and look good and be cute and do tricks and never run in church, and then we'll know that we're okay as parents. And so what happens then is that when the parents aren't okay, they're not okay in their relationship, there's tenseness there, there's sadness, there's frustration, there's some kind of dysfunction here. In this family system, these people start feeling like it must be because they're not performing good enough. So the message that gets communicated is, if something's wrong here, I must have caused it. And if something's wrong here, I'm supposed to fix it. If somebody isn't happy, I must have done something, although I can't think of what it is. I'm not sure what it could be, but it must be me. And so responsibility for the sadness out here falls on me, but I'm not even sure why it is. I can't even point at the exact thing that I did that caused it, but there's this general sense of something I did wrong. I don't know what it is. Plus, I'm responsible to fix it. And in this family system, people are not responsible for themselves. No one is responsible for themselves. Everybody is responsible for everybody else, but nobody for themselves. Well, now we're adults. See, we've left this family system, and now we're adults. And we come to church, and someone comes up to us, and we say, How are you doing? How are things going? And they say, I'm a mess. And this happened, and I'm really sad and frustrated. And we've got this ingrained message in us that we're supposed to know what to say. And so we pretend to know what to say. And we try really hard. And the message that we give people then sometimes is that we're going to be so sad and so frustrated if we give all this help and they don't get help that they pretend to get help to take care of us and to make sure we're not sad. And now it's flipped upside down and now the helpy is helping the helper and that's not okay. It needs to be okay to be weak and wounded and vulnerable and get help that's for you, instead of having to perform or be healthier than you are to take care of the person who's supposed to be the helper. So that's a setup for a lot of us, and we need to look at that so that we don't act that out in the relationships that we have with others. We have a lot of rules that say what other people think is the most important thing. I had rules about being a counselor, what good counselors look like and what they don't look like. And one of the rules was good counselors, the reason counselors are good is because they're past all their problems and they don't have any problems and now they can help people who do. Well, there's no such thing. But what happens is that then you end up getting sick, putting on a facade for people who are wounded because you've got this rule you're trying to follow and you act healthier than you are and you act less needy than you are and then the help that you give is designed to fix everybody so you can hold them up as a measure of whether you're a good counselor or not. And once again, it's upside down. Clients are not here for the counselor. Counselors are here for the client. Even in a relationship that's other than a counselor-client relationship. If you have a friend and their parent dies or they have an incredible trauma happen in their life, they're the weak and wounded one, and at that point, you know, you're there to help them. They're not there to help you. They're not there to stop being sad so that you're not sad about how sad they are. You know, if you're going to be the helper there and you're really sad and you have a mess going on in your life, it's okay to come over here and get support here and get your hugs and everything else over here, but not from the person that you're supposed to be helping. That person's supposed to be the helpee. You're supposed to be the helper. But because we've got these things upside down, sometimes we offer help that doesn't help. Then another issue is the issue of caretaking. There's a difference between being a caregiver and a caretaker. I was thinking about even the word caretaking. What I think of when I hear the word caretaking, when I think of the word caretaker, I think of this little English country castle or a little place that has a guest house and a servant's quarters and a garden. And the caretaker is the one who maintains the place and makes sure it stays the same. And if the help that we're giving is caretaking people, then what it's going to do is help the problem stay the same. It maintains the problem. It doesn't solve it. It doesn't change it. It just is help that maintains the problem. And so one of the big issues in the difference between caretaking and caregiving is that in a healthy relationship with people, we are responsible to them. We're responsible to them, meaning that if I have a relationship, a helper relationship with you, I'm responsible to you, meaning I'm responsible to tell you the truth if I see something. I'm responsible to care if I care. I'm responsible to confront something if I think a damaging thing is happening. I'm responsible to answer your questions truthfully if you ask me. If I care, I should act like I care. But in a caretaking relationship, people don't feel responsible to others. They feel responsible for others, which means that how you're doing is up to me. And I'm responsible for your well-being, and I'm responsible for your feeling, and I'm responsible for your recovery, and I'm responsible for your progress, and now somehow I've gotten the job of your health. And your health is not my job. My job is my health. But in a caretaking relationship, somehow the thing about being responsible to changes into responsibility for. In a caretaking relationship, people try to fix each other. They rescue each other. Rescuing is not okay, in the sense that if a person's life isn't working, and they hit a crisis, all a crisis is is a signal that the person's life isn't working. That's all it is. And you need to help the person through the crisis so that they don't become overwhelmed by the crisis, or they don't die because of the crisis. So you need to help them through the crisis. But the purpose of helping in the crisis is not to make the crisis go away, to obscure the fact that the person's life isn't working. The purpose of the crisis is to use it as a way to get to the fact that the person's life isn't working. And if you just rescue the person from the crisis and never get to those other issues, all you're doing is maintaining or caretaking those other issues. So it's about rescuing. It's a sense of control. Some of you I know are in 12-step groups and self-help groups like that, and they talk a lot about detachment, being detached. And a lot of people come in my office and talk about how hard it is to be detached. But the reason they say that is because a lot of people think that detachment means not caring anymore. And so if you were having extreme kinds of issues or I was in a relationship with you and I cared about you and you were having real bad pain or problems, if I detached from you, that wouldn't mean that I don't care about you anymore and that wouldn't mean that I don't feel sad that you're sad. Detachment does not mean stop caring. It doesn't mean that I won't be affected by the fact that you have pain. If I care, I'm going to be affected. I'm only not affected by the people that I don't care about. Detachment means that even though I care, even though I feel your pain, even though we're having a relationship and I am being affected by what you do, it's not my job to control what happens here. It's your job to control your issue and your health and your pain, not mine. And where detachment comes in is letting go of the control of how the other person's doing. That's being responsible for them. You're not responsible for how they're doing. You're responsible to care. You're responsible to love them. You're responsible to bear their burdens. You're responsible to confront them, exhort them, to give them comfort. But you're not responsible for their pain. You're responsible for your actions and your caring and your reaching out to them. if you're in a caretaking relationship you're going to start to feel tired because now you don't only have the burden of your own health but now you have the burden of somebody else's health and frankly we're not equipped to carry that burden we're not equipped to carry the burden of two people's health we have enough struggle with our own we're going to feel tired, we're going to feel anxious because if we have a need to control things so that when things are okay out here we feel fine in here the problem is things are constantly changing out here and the other side of the problem is that I don't really have control over all this like I think I do so as each of these things change my anxiety level goes up which means that now if I'm going to fix my anxiety level one of two things has to happen I either have to get more controlling and try to fix everything out here even harder so that when everything is okay I'm okay or else I have to change my mind about what I'm responsible for as soon as I change my mind that I'm responsible only for what I do and whether I show care and whether I show concern and whether I tell the truth but I'm not responsible for whether or not you receive it or whether you change or whether you make a different decision then my anxiety level goes down but it doesn't mean I don't care and if you keep getting in more trouble or having your pain it doesn't mean that I'm happy with that or unaffected by that it just means that that's your job, not my job and as soon as people start doing their own jobs the anxiety level goes down but see in a dysfunctional family like what I described before everybody's been taught to do everybody else's job and nobody's been taught to do their own job my main concern is the solution getting the problem over with getting a different behavior finding the answer changing the circumstances being right getting all the details right focusing on performance how things look changing the externals I'll manipulate to do that and I'll be real upset every time that the help doesn't help and the person doesn't live up to my expectations for how healthy they should be now that I've given all of this help to them on the other side where you're responsible to someone it's not about responsible for them but responsible to them now you can empathize with them empathy means have a sense of feeling their pain it's really helpful to someone who's in pain to have someone who feels their pain and senses the weight of that to just come alongside and be in the pain with them that's a really helpful thing it's a very graceful message It's a lot of permission to go through the kind of process we talked about in the first session. Instead of fixing and rescuing, we can just share our insights or our opinions. It's not about making them get it or making them receive it or agree with it. I can be confronted with them if I need to be. Confrontation has kind of a bad rep, I think, because it always seems like a negative thing. But all confrontation really is, is just like holding up a mirror to someone and saying, this is what you look like in my mirror. That's all. And of course, if I'm in a group of ten people, everybody has a little piece of the mirror of this one person. And if we could all kind of show that person a picture of what they look like from our little piece of mirror, they might get a picture of what that's about. But our job isn't to beat people up with the mirror or cut them with it if they don't agree with us or don't like what we're saying. Our job is just to say, this is what it looks like to me. And hopefully the Spirit will take that and put that in their heart and they'll see. That's what a confrontation is. And not only that, but a confrontation, if you did something that I felt hurt about or I was worried about or I was angry about or that I disagreed with, A confrontation could be, I don't like what you did. When you did that, I felt sad. That's the confrontation. But it also might be something like, when you did that, I felt happy. When you said that, I felt supported. So it isn't always a confrontation like this. Anytime you hold up a mirror, when you said that to me, here's what that looked like to me. It looked helpful to me. It felt helpful. That's a confrontation, too. So don't always think of the word confrontation just in the negative context, because a confrontation is just that. It's a neutral term that says, I'm going to give you some data. Here's some data. I can be more sensitive. I can listen. Now, see, we think we have the answer, and we think we have everybody's answer, and we certainly think we have non-Christians' answer, but a lot of times we're not listening to their question. And if we would listen, sometimes they'll ask the question, and we can even give them the answer that matches their question. I'll get more into this as far as thinking that because we have the answer, we have to make people listen to it, because I don't think we do. I'll get to that. But how I feel is not tired then. I feel more relaxed. I feel close to the person. I don't feel threatened by their pain. I feel aware of their pain, but I'm not threatened by it. And now, instead of being concerned with the solution and with the outcome and with the performance and with the answers and with the formula and with being right, now I can be concerned with the person. So on this caretaking side, it's really program-oriented. It's really about how do we solve this issue? How can we get this behavior over with? Or how can we get this sadness gone? And this caregiving side is really more person-oriented, more about the person's pain. and being in it with them and what people feel. And we kind of believe that if we just share ourself and we share what we see, that if the person has some better information about what's going on, they can make a better choice. But it's their choice, and they're responsible for the choice. And we're not here to beat people up with data because if they see us getting really sad or angry that were given us help and it's not helping, they'll pretend to get helped just to get us off their case or to make sure we're not sad or whatever, and that's not called help. That's not helping. I can trust them to be capable in their relationship with God. There's a verse in Philippians 1.6 that says, I'm confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it. Well, who will perfect a good work in you? He will. I won't. I can't. I mean, one of the most helpful things in terms of being a parent is believing this verse about my kids. Because, you see, what I was taught in getting prepared to be a parent by watching my parents, that's mostly where I got my training, to be a parent, is by watching my parents. The message I got was that it's the parent's job to perfect a child. And what this verse says is Paul is confident that he who began the good work will perfect it. The God that is in you will perfect the process he started in you. I'm just someone who gives you data. I'm someone who hugs you when you're sad. I'm someone who confronts you with true things and gives you a picture of what's going on, but I'm not in control of what happens to your goddess. And in Philippians 2, 13, it says, For it's God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. It's not me here to get you to work and will God's good pleasure. It's God who does that. And Paul's making some statements here that he believes. And when I came to believe this about my kids, for instance, it really took me off the hook from having to give answers that I didn't have. Because I don't always know what to do as a dad. And I don't even always know what to do as a husband or as a counselor. But it's not my job in the end to perfect the good work. It's God's job, and I believe he's doing it. He said he will, and I think he is. So that's kind of the piece on caretaking. And another little piece on caretaking, I learned this from my grandmother. My grandmother doesn't give presents because their presence she gives to get a certain response. That's an example of help that is taking instead of giving. So, if you don't respond right in the right time frame, in the right way, with the right amount of words, then she's really upset about that. And see, now don't hear me saying it's okay to be rude, and it's okay not to notice that someone gave you something, or it's okay not to acknowledge that they gave it to you, or it's okay not to say thank you. But what I'm saying is, when she gives someone a gift, she's looking, it's not yours. It's still hers. And two years later, if she comes around and it's not out, she wants to know where it is, and you better not have given it away, and you better have used it even if you didn't need it, and all kinds of things, which means the help that she's giving really isn't helpful. It's not a gift. It puts me in bondage to things, if I go along with that. When my brother got divorced, she took back a bunch of stuff that she'd given him. See, it was never his. If I give you a gift, it's yours. And if you don't say thank you, you don't. But it's yours. I have given it to you because it's a gift. There are no strings attached in that kind of thing. That's why gifts are free. and once you have the gift, that's it. You can say thanks, that's great. I'd like it if you say thanks. If you don't, it's yours still. If you give it to the other person because you think they'd like it better or it would help them, that's fine. It's yours. You decide what you do with the thing that's yours. If you don't like it and you throw it in the trash, that's yours. It's yours. Once I give it, it's yours. Same thing with being a counselor. If someone comes in the office and they say, well, what do you think? And I say, well, here's what I think. that's yours then. I gave that to you, okay? If you like that, that's great. If you don't like that, that's great. If you use that, that's great. If you say that's jerky, that's okay. I didn't give that so that you go, oh, what great advice, you know. I gave that because you asked me what I thought. And I told you. Now I'm done. I've done my part. I've given care. Now you do what you're going to do with it. And I trust that between you and the spirit that lives you and the God who promises to perfect the good work, that something will happen with that. But in the end, it's not my job to make that happen. I plant, to pass water, and God causes the growth. So what's my job? To plant or water? If I plant and water and God doesn't cause the growth, why wasn't there growth? Because God didn't cause it. My job is to plant, not to cause the growth. But we've been taught to cause the growth. We're responsible for all the outcomes here, and that's what gets us tired. And see, when you're on the receiving end of that kind of help, it rejects you, it shames you, because you feel like you're supposed to pretend to be better than you are, and you don't feel accepted right now, being a mess right in your pain. Another issue that makes helping difficult is the boundary issue. Now, a lot of us have a real difficulty with boundaries, and boundaries are the kind of invisible lines that exist in relationships that dictate what's appropriate or inappropriate in that relationship. So, for instance, I was a witness, a prosecution witness, in a court case a couple months ago where a pastoral counselor was charged with sexual exploitation of one of the female clients he was working with. That's a boundary issue. There are certain lines in that relationship, whether they're spoken or not, that dictate what's appropriate and what's inappropriate. So the prosecuting attorney asked me, what do boundaries mean? What does that mean? And I said basically what I just said to you. But see, in the courtroom, there are boundaries too. There are certain things the witness can do and can't do, certain things the attorneys can do and not do, certain things the jury can do, certain things the judge can do. The attorney kept asking me questions, and then I would start to answer it, and the defense attorney would object. Okay, so then I'd have to stop. Then I'd have to look at the judge. Then the judge would say, you may answer the question. Then I'd answer the question. Next question. Object. Look at the judge. Okay? You can't answer that question. Okay? Prosecuting attorney. Why not? Would you both approach the bench? They come up to the bench. Mumbo, mumbo, mumbo, mumbo, come back. You can answer the question. See, those are all the boundaries that govern what's appropriate, inappropriate in that system. In my family, there are boundaries that govern what's appropriate and what's not appropriate. You know, I have four daughters. There are ways I can hug my six-year-old daughter that don't bother her that if I hug my 13-year-old daughter, it would bother her. So I don't do that. Now, she never said that. She didn't say, no, when I get to be 12, that's it. No, you know, it's like what I'm noticing about my 13-year-old daughter is she doesn't want to give a body hug. She just doesn't want to do it. That's not about me. That's about she's starting to set up boundaries around herself that she's supposed to set up, and that's okay with me. But I can pick the little bitty daughter up and hug her like crazy, and she doesn't mind. If she's in the bathroom and I walk in on her, it's no big deal. She couldn't care less. She doesn't even know I'm there. She doesn't even close the door. She doesn't even close the door when she's going to the bathroom. If the 13-year-old is in there and she's fully dressed and just looking in the mirror and I walk in, I'm in trouble. Because there's a boundary there, and it's okay. That's my point. It's okay. It's okay for children to say no to an adult if no is the real answer. We need to deal with the real answer. It's okay for kids to have an opinion that's different than ours if their opinion is different than ours. We need to deal with it. But if we come from systems, churches, families that say, it's not okay for you to have an opinion, it's not okay for you to have a boundary, you must accept the help I give you because I'm giving it to you, for instance, then we're confused about boundaries. People who have been abused sexually, physically, verbally, what that's about is that that's somebody saying, because I'm bigger than you and stronger than you and louder than you or older than you or male or whatever, I can come across your boundaries and do damage here and you don't have to like it. And you just don't learn that it's okay to have a boundary around you that says, if you come in here, it's because I decide to let it down. It's not because you bang it down. And so we get confused about where we stop and where other people start. We don't know where that is. And now we're supposed to help people, and we don't have a sense of how close to come or how far to stay, and so sometimes we come too close with our help, and it's not helpful. Boundaries have a lot to do with how we act. When I was at Bethel, we did an experiment in the psychology department. This woman student and I did this experiment where we went to shopping malls and accosted people's body space. We walked up to them, you know, clerks in stores like this, and asked them, you know, could you show us where the shirts are, like that. And people ran away, you know. I mean, it's because we crossed their boundaries, okay. But what if there's some kind of rule that says, I can come up to you and do that to you, and if you run away, you're not submissive or you're not spiritual or you're not okay, so you have to sit there and let me do that to you. The message that you're going to get is not going to be a helpful message, even if it's a helpful message. It's going to be a hurtful kind of thing. And you'll end up sitting there to take care of me and how I might feel if you ran away or said get away, and now the help isn't for the helper. I mean for the helpy, it's for the helper. It flips upside down. So boundaries are a really big issue when people aren't aware of their own boundaries, and they're not aware of what their job is and what isn't their job, and they're not aware of other people's boundaries, and so it just has a real kind of complicating effect when it comes time to give help. Let me tell you some of the ways that Jesus dealt with people in despair because I think that we can start to get some ideas about what would be helpful. Turn to Matthew. There's a couple passages that I want to share from Matthew. One is Matthew 9, verse 35. Jesus was going about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. And seeing the multitudes, he felt compassion for them because they were distressed and downcast like sheep without a shepherd. The word, I remember when Dave preached this sermon and the word he felt compassionate for them. The word compassion is like sick to your stomach almost. It's like when you look at something, if you feel compassion for that, it's like this is not right. It's not okay that this is like this. This is wrong. Not like morally wrong, but you know, like unjust. This is wrong. And I can do something about this. Compassion is, the way that Dave described it, I remember, is he said, when you put the God of heaven in a human body called Jesus, when you put God in a human body and show him all the pain that people are having in the world, he gets sick. He feels sick about that. That's the compassion. And the word distressed and downcast, these are perfect passive participles in the Greek, which means that you could see somebody sitting in a restaurant looking distressed. It means like they have a lot of distress or stress, and they're looking kind of distressed and downcast. Well, that's not what these words mean. They don't mean distressed and downcast. Distressed would be what I would be if I tried to pick up that piano. Or distressed would be what the piano would be if all of us tried to stand on it. It would be what would happen if you tried to put too many cars on a bridge. The bridge would get distressed. And so the passive means, about the passive part of the Greek there, means that something, some weight is being put on these people. They're not just sad. It's not just, you know, when he looked around and saw all the sad people, he's looking at people that are having a weight put on them. They're distressed. The effects of having this weight placed on them is that they're under the weight. They're distressed. Downcast, you know, you might say, boy, does that person have a downcast expression on their face? That would mean that their countenance is down, you know, they look bummed. But that's not what that means. What downcast means is cast down. It means that he looked at these people who have been thrown in the dust. They've been thrown down. So they've had a weight put on them that they can't bear, and they're going under, you know, because of the weight that's on them, and they've been thrown down. And, you know, I mean, I don't want to get this too big of a sermon here about this, but in this context, what it is is it's the religious system that has been wearing these people out. And when Jesus looks at the people who have been given a weight that they can't bear and that wears them out and that have been thrown down in the dust, his response to them is compassion. This is not right. this is not okay and I can do something about this. So his response to people who are in that condition is not to give them some formula or some not to say, well I know what you guys need to do and if you just did it everything would be great. His response is compassion. Another verse that's kind of like that is the one in Matthew 11. Matthew 11, 28 says Now, what he's saying there is Jesus offers rest to people who are tired. And my experience, more than not, my experience in the religious community is that churches don't give tired people rest. They give them more to do. And tired people don't need more to do. They need to rest. In this case, the words are heavy laden, weary and heavy laden. Heavy laden is the same kind of word as those other two words. It isn't just that they're carrying a load that is too heavy for them and it's wearing them down. Heavy laden means that they were laden. It was something that was placed on them. They didn't take it up. It's the difference between if I say I'm going to take the piano and that's what I've decided and you can't talk me out of it and so I go drag the piano to my house. Someone might go by and say, boy, is he heavy laden with that piano? And I would be, okay? But I did it myself. But that's not what this is talking about. This would be like you come to me and you say, you have to take that piano to your house, and you put it on my back and make me carry it. So it's something done to them, not by them. That's what the Greek does with that. And the word weary there means constantly in the process of being wearied, kind of like that. So in other words, this is the kind of thing where they're being heavy laden with stuff, and the harder they try to do it, the more tired they get. So this means that trying hard is exactly the wrong solution. Because the harder that you try, the more tired you get. Jesus offers rest. We can do the question now. Well, okay, confronting someone who's hurting. Well, you really look sad today. I mean, you know, sometimes you say that to people and you start crying. You really look sad. That's a conference. Here's what you look like to me. And that's all, you know, it isn't like I'm supposed to fix your sin. I just noticed this. Here's what it looks like. And maybe that's the permission they needed to be as sad as they are. Okay, we'll do more questions at the end. Next text is Matthew 7. and I want to combine this Matthew 7 text with Revelation 3 because I think that Revelation 3 is a really, really powerful text that I just have recently seen a truth in. Matthew 7, verse 7 says, Ask and it shall be given to you. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be opened to you. Now, this is somebody who needs something. Can you see that? This is you, okay, or me, and we need something. Who is responsible for asking for what they need? I am. Who is responsible for knocking to get in? Me. Who is responsible for doing the looking? I am. See, his job is if you ask, he'll give it. That's what he promises. But it's not his job to give it to you because you need it and you haven't asked. You need to ask. If you ask, he'll give it to you. If you knock, that's your job. Your job is the knocking. Now, he's the helper in this instance. So his job isn't to say, well, I can't wait for you to knock, so I'm just going to give it to you anyway. What's an even more clear example of this is Revelation 3, verse 20, which I think we've heard taught in some wrong ways. A lot of the teaching of this is out of context. because these are to the churches. So these are not to, this is the verse that says, Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I'll come into him and dine with him and he with me. This is not to non-Christians, this verse. This isn't pleading with non-Christians that Jesus is knocking on the door and if they would just open the door, he'd come in and they could be a Christian. These letters in the first part of Revelation are written to the churches. to the people in the churches, to the Christians. And what he's saying there is his job as the... Now, see, I picture Jesus, if you want to talk about somebody who's got an answer that people need, I think he's it, okay? If you want to talk about somebody who's right, I think he's it. There's no one righter and no one with a better answer than what he has and what he is. What he does with that is he comes and knocks at the door. He stands at the door and knocks at the door. His job is to knock at the door. You'd think if anybody had a right to bang down the door and force his answer on people, it would be him, because he's righter than we'll ever be in terms of knowing what people need and having what they need, but he doesn't. He respects their boundary. Jesus respects the boundary that's there, and so his job is to knock on the door. Our job is to open the door or not open the door. See, we're in charge of the door. He's in charge of the knocking. If we don't open the door, he doesn't come in. If we open the door, he comes in. Everybody does their own job. And when I was first out of seminary, I really thought that it was my job to answer everybody's questions and give everybody what they needed, and I didn't care if they opened their door or not. I banged it down. I banged it down on airplane rides. I banged it down on bus stops, and I banged it down in neighborhoods, and it didn't matter if they wanted to know. I'm right. I've got the answer, and they need it, and I know they need it, and they don't know they need it, but it doesn't matter. I'll give it to them anyway. And Jesus respects people's boundaries. You know, I would think if anybody had the right to not respect our boundaries, it would be him. What are you going to say? You know, I mean, How are you going to argue with him if he doesn't? But he does. And that's what that verse is about. I want to show you some other verses that are just how our presence with people communicates some really powerful things. Matthew 18 is a passage, and it's after the stuff about confronting the brother in sin and all that. Verse 18 says, Truly I say to you, whatever you shall bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven. Now see, I don't believe that that means that we have the power to loose and bind things. Some people do, but I don't think that's what that means. I don't have the power to bind anything, and I don't have the power to loose anything. But if you look at the Greek here, even the English says it in the New American Standard, truly I say to you, whatever you shall bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven. In other words, it's already bound there. And whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven. It's already loose there. Now, the illustration of this is, if you have someone who's struggling with some sin they did or some hurt they have, and they're struggling with knowing that they're forgiven for that, the Bible clearly says they are, but they just can't let it in. It's hard for them to let it in. You don't have the power to go and make them a forgiven person. You can't go tell them they're forgiven, and they're forgiven because you told them they are. But you do have the power on earth to make them look or experience as much forgiveness in their relationship with you as they already have because of Jesus. That's what you do have the power to do. And so that's what we need to do. And so I think I spend a lot of time doing that. I don't have the power to make anybody okay, or to make anybody a valuable, acceptable, loved-without-strings person. But I do have power in my counseling relationship with them, and in my relationship as a dad and a husband to my family. I do have some power in my relationship to help them experience on this level what's already true on this level, which is that they are accepted and they are valuable and they are loved and it is without strings, and I can do that. Just by the way I am in my relationship with them. Another verse that's kind of like that is John 20, verse 23. If you forgive the sins of any, their sins have been forgiven. It doesn't say if you forgive the sins of any, their sins will be forgiven. It says they have previously already been forgiven. So I don't have the power to forgive anybody or cause them to be forgiven, but I do have the power to make them look like or experience in our relationship as much forgiveness as they already have because of the cross. And there's an incredible power in that. Another verse that's about presence is 2 Corinthians 7. 2 Corinthians 7 says, verse 5, For even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest. We were afflicted on every side, conflicts without fears within. I just want to stop there a minute. If this were testimony time, you know, at the local church, how do you think it would go over if Paul said, our flesh had no rest, we had conflicts without and fears within? See, what you're supposed to say is conflicts without victory within. Like that? That's not what Paul says. He's saying, we're so tired we couldn't stand it. We're a mess. We had conflicts, everything was going wrong out here, and we were scared to death in here. But God, who comforts the depressed. Now, the point there is that God's stance towards depressed people is comfort. It's not anything but comfort. It never is God who has any problem with our pain. People have problems with our pain. God has no problem with our pain. He's perfectly okay with it. And his stance towards the depressed person is comfort. And the way he did it, God who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the coming of Titus. He sent a person. And then it goes on and says, not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you. In other words, Titus must have been a mess at Corinth. They comforted him. He received the comfort. He was kind of put back together again, you know. And Paul's a mess, so he goes and gives away what he got. I'll get into that a little bit more in a minute. 2 Corinthians 5 is another presence kind of thing. Verse 5, 18. Now all these things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, namely that God in Christ was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them. He has committed to us the word of reconciliation. Therefore, we're ambassadors for Christ as though God were entreating through us. We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. Well, the word ambassadors there is just that. It's ambassadors. And what an ambassador is, is an ambassador is somebody who goes into a hostile territory. So it would be like the ambassador to Russia. Here's Russia. And I'm an American, so this is hostile territory. They, you know, look me over real carefully when I go there. And I'm scared there, and this is a hostile place. And so what the ambassador does is it's his job to come from our side and go over into the hostile territory and set up a little safe place called an embassy. And so if I'm out here, I'm in hostile territory, and that's kind of scary. But even in the middle of Russia, when I go into the American embassy and I'm in here, it's not that I'm in some building in Russia, it's that I'm in the United States. When I'm in the embassy, I am on U.S. soil. It's not in a building on Russian soil. I'm in U.S. soil. And the ambassador's job is to go into the dangerous place and set up a safe place for the people who are from his country. Now, we're ambassadors. And we're ambassadors from God himself. And we're here in the unsafe place, which is Satan's turf, the world that he rules and controls, and the flesh, all the natural stuff around us. And we're people who have a supernatural source. Our life is from the Spirit. We are aliens here. We are visitors. This is not our home. If you kill us, we go home. This is not home. We're just visitors here. But while we're here, we're ambassadors. And what that means is that we need to be the people to one another and to the world that set up the safe place in the middle of the unsafe place. And that communicates a lot of stuff to people who are wounded and who are in pain. To find a place to be safe and to heal and to go through whatever process they need to be restored. So we're ambassadors. I just want to tell you two stories real quickly. When I was in seminary, I took a pastoral care course and I had to do an internship and I did it at Deaconess Hospital, Fairview Deaconess. And it was the kind of deal where we went there, and they handed out these cards. And the cards were like five patients that you had to go visit while you were there. And, you know, of course, now I thought I was supposed to fix them. I mean, they're a mess, and they were like terminally ill people. These were people with chronic heart condition and all kinds of stuff. And it's like I was thinking the whole time, I'm supposed to know what to say so they'll feel better about having a chronic heart condition. Okay? That's what I thought. So I'd go in, and I'd be telling them stuff, and they just weren't cheering up. I didn't get it. So I remember one thing where we had to do a verbatim, and a verbatim is where you go in the room, and you do the deal, the visit, and then you run out of the room as fast as you can, and you write down the whole thing, okay? She said, I said, she said, I said, she said, like that, back and forth, and you number them, like 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, 1C, 2C, like that. Okay, so I did that with this one woman who tried to commit suicide. And I went in there the night before. I mean, it pumped her stomach the night before. So I went in there, and I'm going to save this person and give her a reason to live, okay? And I'm giving her Romans 7, the things that we hate we still do, and all this stuff, you know? And she just wasn't even cooperating with me at all. And then I had to go and write this down, you know, and then I had to run photocopies of it and bring it to the group, which were like six or eight other people in this internship, plus the two chaplains. And then they look at this, and then you come back the next week to ask you questions, okay? So I come back the next week, and they all pull out my verbatim, and they say, the chaplain says, well, now, look at exchange number three, okay? Why did you say that, what you said right there? I look at it, and it's really stupid. And I'm thinking, oh, no, why did I say that? That's really stupid. So then I go, well, the reason I said it, and blow a bunch of smoke at this guy, okay? And he's cool as a cucumber. He goes, okay, well, that's fine. Well, then if that's the reason why you said that, why did you say what you said in number 11? So I looked at number 11, and I went, oh, no. I'm deeper than I was than I started. And so I go, well, it's because, and I blow some more smoke. And he's cool. He says, okay, that's great. So then he says, if the reason why you said number three is that, and the reason why you said number 11 is that, why did you say number 17? And he just kept doing that to me. And see, what I was trying to do and what he saw was, I was trying to fix this person. I was trying to make them not be suicidal. And he spotted it right now, and he kept asking me, and he kept pointing me at that in me. And I remember, it felt like he was taking my clothes off one piece at a time. It was terrible. And I saw this picture, I got this vision of myself. Every time he asked a question, this wall went up. And I was hiding behind this wall going, how can I get out of this one? And then I kind of lower the wall a little bit and shoot my answer over it and put it back up again and hope he wouldn't ask any more questions. And that was so frustrating. I learned so much about myself and about the agenda that I had for people when I gave them help. Now I'll tell you another story. This was a couple years ago. There was a couple in our church, and her mother was dying of cancer. She was about 60 years old, dying of cancer. She was in the hospice over at North Memorial, and I didn't know her at all, but I knew the family. So I went up there to visit, and I said hello to the family and everything else. And then I went in the room with the mom, and she was laying there in bed, and she was sleeping. So I sat down next to the bed on the chair, and I just was sitting there. And all of a sudden, she opens her eyes, and she says, who are you? And I said, well, I'm Jeff Van Vonderen from Open Door, and I know your daughter and her husband. And she said, oh. And then we just sat there, and then she said, well, I don't know what to say. and I said well I don't know what to say either so why don't I just hold your hand for a while and just sit here and then when you go back to sleep I'll just leave and she said that'd be great so I just sat there and held her hand what do you say to somebody who's terminally ill and really bummed out about it even past all the confusion in a really depressed kind of state. There's nothing you can say. What I said to her by what I didn't say was that I'm okay with you. Your pain's okay with me. And I think that incredible ministry happened there, and I didn't have any answers for her or anything else. I just gave her me. That's all I could give her. Ten years ago, I'd have pretended to know what to say, and she'd have been offended. Or she'd have ended up taking care of me. And see, she's not there to take care of me. I'm there to care for her. I want to give you one last thing about sympathetic high priests, and this is what I promised the first session. I told you I would tell you a little bit more when my dad died. When my dad died, just to tell you what kind of a doer I am, I went down and visited him in the hospital the week before he died. I was there for three days. By the end of the second day, I had all of his symptoms. He was nauseous. I was nauseous. He had the chills. I had the chills. He had diarrhea. I had diarrhea. He had a fever. I had a fever. So I think we connected. I think you could say that. And we cried together. We said, this stinks. What a ripoff. It was great. I mean, I said everything I had to say to him, and he said what he had to say to me, and I thanked him for what he gave me that worked, and I confronted him about stuff that didn't work that I'm still struggling with, and he apologized for stuff, and I apologized for stuff, and whatever. But then I had to go do a seminar. And see, I'm such a doer, you know, and he even understood. I mean, on Wednesday, I said, I've got to go do the seminar. And he said, okay, you know, because that's what he taught me to do. That's the responsible thing to do. And I said, I don't think I'm ever going to see you again, and I'm really sad about that. And he said, I know, me too. And we cried, and I kissed him, and that was it. I got in the car with two of my kids, drove to, it was in Connecticut. I got to Cleveland. By the time I got to Cleveland, the symptoms were gone. Went to Connecticut, did the seminar Friday night, Saturday, during the day, Saturday night, Sunday morning, Sunday night, and 15 minutes from the end of the seminar, I get a phone call, the pastor takes it, my dad died, I take the call, come back, finish the seminar, because I'm really slick, finish the seminar, drop my kids off in Wilmington, Delaware, drive to Philadelphia, take a plane to Green Bay, do three days of funeral with my family, get back in a plane, go to Philadelphia, go back to Wilmington, pick up the kids, and go to Maine and do another seminar, go to New Brunswick, Canada, and do another seminar. This was the summer I got famous. This is that story. Some of you know about that story. What I mean by that is when I got to Canada, they loved me. They put me on Canadian Cablevision. They bought all my tapes. They listened to everything I said. I made up stuff they liked. They loved everything. I drove back along the north side of the Great Lakes, stopped in Hayward for a couple days to stay with my mom, came back down. Our house was completely remodeled. All the furniture was in a heap with a cover over it and sheetrock dust all over the house. We had to live at somebody else's house and drive back for back and forth for 10 days. And a week later, my wife had our fourth baby. I said to my wife, you know, when I get famous enough, maybe we'll just take the summers off. I mean, I can hardly believe I said that, but I said that, okay? Yeah, I'm getting famous now in my, you know, young age. And maybe we'll get to the point where I don't have to work in the summer. That's basically what I was saying, and God gave me the summer off right now. Nobody wanted to hear me. I didn't get any seminars. No clients were coming in, and I was sitting there feeling sorry for myself. Nobody wants to listen to me. Like God said, okay, big shot famous guy, take the summer off. Like that. So August comes, and I'm so depressed I can't get out of the chair sitting in my office at the church building. Johnson walks in, sits on the back of the sofa, and he says, well, see, what happened was when I stopped doing all that stuff, I started to grieve, and all that pain started to sink in, you know, and I started to feel all the loss of that, but while I was doing my tap dance routine for three months, it didn't happen. So Johnson comes in, and he sits on the back of my sofa, and he goes, depressed, huh? I said, yeah, and he said, I bet you know why, too. I said, yep. He said, well, I bet you know what to do about it, too. I said, yep. He said, I bet you didn't work either. I said, nope. He said, well, I'm doing a text in Hebrews. Were any of you here for Hebrews? Hebrews was a long time ago. Hebrews, holy cats, that was before 1 Corinthians. People don't, you know, how long have you been here? Well, I came in Ephesians 2. I mean, people don't, they don't know what year you came in or, you know. It was Hebrews. He says, I'm doing a sermon in Hebrews. Hebrews 4.14, Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God. Let us hold fast our confession, for we don't have a high priest who can't sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all ways as we are yet without sin. I said, hold it, wait a minute. Now if you're going to tell me that Jesus has been through this and he knows how I feel, I already knew that and that doesn't help. He said, no, I wasn't going to tell you that. I said, okay, what are you going to tell me? He said, I was going to tell you the next verse. Next verse. we don't have a high priest who can't sympathize. It says, therefore, because of that, let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Now see, what he said to help me is not the way I'm going to apply this. I'm going to apply it that way and another way. What he said to help me was, he said, I think that it could be that God is turning you into a sympathetic high priest. And I said, what do you mean? He said, well, I think that someday you're probably going to have somebody sitting in the chair that's so depressed they can't move. And you're going to know what that's like, and you're going to know how that feels, and you're going to know that formulas don't work, and you're going to know that you can't get up and work your way out of that. But here it says that sympathetic high priest give mercy and grace. And you'll just give that person mercy and grace. Now when he said that, my depression did not go away. But it did make sense. It did make some sense to it. It didn't lift. I was still depressed. And see, what he was saying there is when you go to a sympathetic high priest, when you go to a high priest for help, that's a sympathetic high priest, you get mercy and grace to help in time of need. When you go to an unsympathetic high priest, you get a formula, or you get advice, like these unsympathetic high priests we're learning about in Job. They're unsympathetic high priests. You get a system, you get more to do. Sympathetic high priests give mercy and grace. And I'll bet you can think in your life and make a list and know right now very easily who are the sympathetic high priests in your life and who are the unsympathetic high priests. But you need to know that we have a sympathetic one, and we can even be sympathetic high priests to each other. And that gets back to this comfort that Titus got that he gave away. Because even though what I'm going to say, if you're struggling like crazy, is not going to make the struggle go away, what this verse says is that this is not for nothing. And someday, you're going to have someone looking at you, telling you your story that you're going through right now, and you're going to know exactly what that is, and you're going to be a sympathetic high priest, and you will give them grace and mercy to help in time of need instead of some system or formula they're supposed to follow to work or perform their way out of the pain. Sympathetic high priests give mercy and grace, and we can be that for each other. Our struggles don't, God doesn't waste our pain, he doesn't waste our struggle. He gives us himself and each other in it, but he even uses it after it's way in the past. Because we can be sympathetic high priests who give grace instead of performance to people who are in pain. let's pray and then we'll do some questions Father I just pray that you would use this session tonight to touch people's hearts to give them the strong message that in you they can give help to each other and that it isn't about controlling the outcome but it's just about being who they are and giving people permission to have the struggle that they're having thank you that you loved us thank you that you're a sympathetic high priest thank you that when we go to you, we don't get a performance code or a bunch of expectations, but we go and find mercy and grace to help us when we're in need. In Jesus' name, Amen. Okay, we've got a few minutes here. Have you got any questions? You know, lots of times the grace and mercy you can give someone in pain is that the pain that they have is an issue, but then they're all really feeling indicted for having the pain, you know, for not being spiritual enough to not have been affected that way. And a lot of times that's where the mercy and grace can come is just giving them permission to be in the struggle that they're in. If the Spirit does live in them, they're going to make it. And you can be a resource in that. But the struggle is not a negative thing. It's not fun and it hurts, but you don't have to fix it. Anybody else? One of the issues that I have about that kind of standing in faith that you're talking about is if you have faith, if that's really there, stand in it. But if that means pretend that you think this is going to work out when you really don't because you've got this standard of faith you're supposed to have that you don't have, that's just called pretending. I'll give you an example of this. Back at the old building, we used to have people come forward and get prayed for and stuff, and someone would come up and we'd anoint them and we'd pray for them, the elders and stuff, we'd pray for them. And what I noticed was I just didn't believe they were going to get well. I just didn't. And then I'd feel so guilty and so ashamed because I felt like now if they don't, it's my fault. You know, all these guys are believing like crazy, and I'm the only one up here who's not believing this, so I would stand in faith anyway, but all I was doing was pretending to have faith I didn't really have. What illustrated this for me was that one time two people came up. same time and we prayed for both of them and what i noticed it was the most incredible thing what i noticed was that for one of the people i had faith and i didn't crank it up i had it and i prayed like crazy that that person would be healed and they even were but for the other person i just didn't believe that they would and i didn't pretend i i prayed for as much as i did have faith to pray for which at that point was that god would use this to make himself clear to that person, but I didn't have the faith to believe that God would heal that person. I didn't have it. And so I could pretend I had it to live up to that expectation that I'm supposed to stand in faith, but I don't think that's standing in faith. I think that kind of faith is a gift. And if you're cranking up fake faith to live up to some standard that says you're supposed to have faith, then you are going to be in denial, and you are going to get stuck in the grief process, and you are not going to be able to ever get past all the pain of having the loss. It's almost like if we have enough faith that this is going to get back together again, whether we have it or not, God can't tell that this is really broken. And I think that sometimes he can. So if you really do have faith, you look in there and that's really there, that this is going to be restored, stand in it. But don't call pretending to think something's going to happen when you don't really believe it as faith. That's called pretending. That's what I think about it.
