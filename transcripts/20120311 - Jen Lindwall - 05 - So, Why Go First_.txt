Well, if you were here last week, then you probably remember that Dave reframed Colossians three for us, as a series of invitations to go first, he called it. So Paul's call to wives, to husbands, to children, to fathers, to slaves, was to go first, to submit, to love, to respect, to obey, to serve. Wives, submit to someone, even if they don't deserve it. Husbands, love your wives even when you could dominate them. Children, obey your parents. Fathers, be gentle with your children. Slaves, obey your master. Do good work for them even when they're not looking. Be a people who does what no one else is willing to do. Not because it sounds nice, not because you should, but because of the name you live underneath. And that name is all about paving a way, about going first so that others can experience life. About two years into my marriage, my husband Ben and I had a fight in the car ride home from a dinner. And I don't really remember what the fight was about. I don't really remember who said the last word, but what I remember was getting home and out of the car in silence, going into our house and going to bed without talking. And then we got up the next day, which was a Saturday, and we got up in silence. We ate breakfast in silence. We painted our dining room in silence. Are you getting the pattern here? The entire day in silence. And no, I didn't spend half the day running errands. Yes, we ate meals in the same room, and we didn't talk. And I remember I was having this kind of internal battle going on inside. You know, like, should I say something first? And what should I say? And how should I say it? I even remember opening my mouth, but nothing would come out in that moment. And I had all these emotions going on inside. I was really sad that we were spending our Saturday this way. I was really mad at Ben for not talking to me. I was confused about what the fight was even about. Really? And I was ashamed that I couldn't just get over whatever it was and just talk to him. But still, I refused to talk to my husband for almost a full day. so when I heard Dave's message last week I thought of that moment right because in this invitation to go first I thought of that moment and how hard it was to figure out what that really looks like how confusing it can be to figure out how to do that have you had that moment when you open your mouth in an attempt to speak but nothing comes out I don't want to be a brat, right? I don't want to give my husband the silent treatment. Most of us don't want things to go badly in any given situation, but I'm also not an endless supply of creative and gracious responses to the hard situations that I end up in. I might be able to open my mouth, but that doesn't mean I know what to say. Going first is a really tall order. It really is, and if we're serious about walking this out, then we have to be willing to ask some hard questions. And so I want to spend our time this morning exploring three questions. Why do we go first? What does it look like to go first? And what is the result of us going first? I had this experience last year where I was in a conflict with someone, but we weren't talking about it. And so I decided to finally just go for it and talk to this person about it and find out what their experience was. And so I did the hard thing of going to them and asking them what was going on and it went really horribly. Like, I thought it would go bad and it went worse than that. So I decided to go first in some way and it totally blew up in my face. Have you ever had that experience? I think that happens probably half the time. Maybe more. I mean you make this resolution you put yourself out there you reach out and then it doesn't go at all how you hoped or planned why do we go first? I want to bring us back to the text Colossians 3 I know we've read it many many times I preached this verse six months ago when I was up here but I really think there's new invitations for us every time we read it so I encourage you open up your Bibles or follow along on the screen. We're going to start in Colossians 3.17. Paul says, whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them. Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not embitter your children or they'll become discouraged. Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything and do it not only when their eye is on you to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. That's some hard stuff, right? Be the first to love, to submit, to put the other before you. And what is the purpose of it? What is Paul's so that in this text? Because if I'm going to go first, I'm going to have a so that, right? We all have so that. So what are yours? I go first so that she goes first next time. Or I go first so that he sees what a jerk he's being. Or so that everyone from the outside can see the situation for what it really is. Or so that I keep my job. Or so that I'm not left out. Or so that this person changes. But if you look at Colossians 3, Paul gives no desired outcomes for these relationships. Between these people, he doesn't say, wives, submit your husbands so that. They understand that they're being jerks. Husbands, love your wives so that they do what you want. Children, obey your parents so that they give you the car keys on a Friday night. None of that. There is no do this, so that in Colossians 3. I think we underestimate how often wanting to change other people motivates us. We fooled ourselves into thinking that we actually can change people and situations. A wise friend of mine recently said to me, Jen, the sooner that you realize that you cannot change anyone else, then you'll be free. And she repeated that to me like three times in a row. I'm always trying to change people. We all are always trying to change each other. In big ways and small ways. And motivation is such a tricky thing because you can't will it to change. You can't muster it up. You can't close your eyes and just wish, wish, wish for pure intentions. Or that you're not going to be hoping for a certain outcome. When we go first in a situation and try to love someone well, it's kind of unimaginable to think that we could do that without at least a hope for a certain outcome, you know, or a hope that the person would receive it in a certain way. For me, when I approached this person that I was in conflict with, I was motivated by wanting to look thoughtful and like I cared by going first. And I was also motivated by the desire to have the upper hand in the event that this person said some things that I didn't think were fair so I could defend myself. That's what motivated me. And when things didn't go the way that I planned, I got sucked into kind of a black hole of self-doubt and shame because the things this person said were really hard to hear. And they caught me off guard and they made me super insecure and I didn't know how to respond because I thought I was going to make this conversation happen a certain way and I couldn't. We have this false sense that we walk around and we make things happen or we keep things from happening when the truth is we cannot control other people's responses in situations or outcomes in situations. Still, if something goes well, it's a job well done for us, and if it doesn't, or if a person doesn't see things our way, it was our fault and we didn't try hard enough. So we put our efforts into creating outcomes that matter in our life. This is why you'll probably never miss a beat in complimenting your supervisor. You just won't. Or showing them a job well done. But we will often miss an opportunity to look the barista at Starbucks in the eye. Because how does the outcome of that impact us and our lives? We think we have the ability to control the people and the world around us. We overestimate that. And at the same time, we underestimate the impact of how we treat each other, the impact it has on their souls, the impact it has on our soul. You know, I worked at Starbucks over a decade ago, and I still remember specific instances where people scolded me. I remember this one woman who got mad at me because her latte was taking too long, vividly. That stuff sticks with people. Still, we don't find it hard to see the important people in our midst, and we often overlook the outsider. We put our energy into creating outcomes, making things happen that matter, with our family, our job, our image, without recognizing that we really can't change other people. And all that striving, it causes us to miss chances to really see people in a way that matters. When we decide to go first, to go towards, to step out of what's comfortable. We go first simply by letting go of a grip on a certain outcome, which is a really significant way to go first. What does it look like to go first, though? How do you do that? Great place to start is in the life of Christ, because it was a life of firsts. Think about all the firsts. Talking to the woman at the well, who no Jewish man in his right mind would have talked to. Healing on the Sabbath, touching a leper, healing the child of a Gentile, protecting a prostitute from humiliation, and on and on and on until the ultimate first, making a way for us by going to the cross. Jesus showed us how to go first with his life and death. And so I want to take us to a story of Jesus. It's found in Luke 9. It starts in verse 51. When the days were approaching for his ascension, he, that is Jesus, was determined to go to Jerusalem. And he sent messengers on ahead of him, and they went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for him. But they did not receive him because he was traveling toward Jerusalem. When his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them? But he turned and rebuked them and said, you do not know what kind of spirit you are of. for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives but to save them. And they went on to another village. So Jesus wants to go to Jerusalem and he decides to go through Samaria. Now the Samaritans were the enemies of the Jews. They were seen as dirty half-breeds. Jewish people would go around Samaria instead of through. So this is a first. This Jewish man is saying that he wants to travel through and be with the Samaritans, which is incredible. and so he wants to do this amazing, heroic, you know, awesome thing and they won't have him. So he has this desired outcome that he wants to see happen and he's been rejected. So James and John come up with a great response. Let's kill them with fire, right? Now, we might say, well, that's extreme, but don't we have our own ways of asking that question? You know, we have our own Samarias that we're going around and we might move into something and go first. And if they don't do it the way we do, we just say, let's shut it down. They're not worth it. They're not responding to this in the way that they should. But Jesus says, no, no. You don't know what kind of spirit you're of. The son of man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. The Greek word here for spirit is pneuma. Literally translated as a current of air, a breath, a breeze. So there's a current of air blowing through the world, James and John, you're a part of it. But you don't even understand the essence of it. Jesus could actually have controlled the outcomes of these situations. And he didn't. When his followers wanted to retaliate, he said, no, that is not the current of air this world needs. That's not the essence of who I am, of who God is. We don't destroy, we save, no matter the outcome or response, even if it doesn't go our way. We stay in this current. We don't waver. Jesus followed the path to go first, and he left it to the hearts of people to decide how to respond. A few months ago, we had some people over at our house, and there was a gentleman there who started to get really worked up about some political stuff happening. And he started getting really loud and being really angry. And he started saying some kind of offensive things to the people that were there. And I could feel this kind of thing bubbling up in me. I wanted to stand up and kick him out of our house. Like, just say, out. But I did not. I stayed quiet. And so did everyone else in the room. No one responded. So you could kind of hear him kind of realize that no one was fighting back and kind of started to ramble and then kind of the energy went down until it just kind of fizzled out. And there was silence for four or five minutes, which is a really long time if you're sitting in a living room with a group of people, right? And after about four or five minutes of silence, this person's son, who's probably in his mid-20s, gets up, walks across the room, stands in front of his dad, and he says, dad can I give you a hug? I really love you. It was unbelievable. What do you think usually happened when this guy got angry? People fought back, people ignored him, they shamed him, they appeased him. I don't know but this time his son went first in a very profound way, offering him grace and love and mercy. And in that moment, his son was the only one who could do that. I couldn't offer him that. For me, I practiced restraint, right? And that's going first too, in a way that matters. But my internal dialogue during that was, why is this person acting so crazy, and when is this going to be over? I was telling this story this week to a couple people and Joel said, well, at least no one got up and went to the kitchen. But I actually did do that during the silence. I think it's because the dessert was in the oven is what I will say, but I really also wanted some reprieve. So this young man though, his internal dialogue was not about restraint. It wasn't about escape. Whether consciously or unconsciously, I think he was asking some really important questions. What does love look like here? What does healing look like? And how could I participate in that? And then when he felt that prompting, he actually did a really difficult thing. He didn't know what would happen. He got up in front of a room of people. His dad might not have hugged him back. And would it still have been the right thing to do? Would it still have been worth it? Even if it didn't turn out the way that he wanted it to. There's this great poem by Edward Markham. He drew a circle that shut me out. Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout. But love and I had the wit to win. We drew a circle that took him in. That's exactly what this young man did. He redrew the circle. This is exactly what Jesus did his entire life. And ultimately, with his death, drawing the biggest circle imaginable. the name of Jesus gives us the power to redraw the circle and that does not mean we get to decide how another person responds but we get to decide how we respond everyone is free to do what he or she wants to do and to take responsibility to draw circles that bring people in and love them instead of keep them out and this doesn't look the same for all of us and this doesn't look the same in all the seasons of our life, and it doesn't look the same in all of our relationships. Because sometimes going first means drawing a boundary for the first time. Sometimes what does love look like and what does healing look like? It looks like saying to someone, no, this is a boundary in our relationship now. And so part of our work is to discern what it looks like to go first in different relationships in different seasons. But instead of asking the question, what does this person's response deserve right now? You know, what does my judgment and perception of this say that it deserves? The questions become, am I paying attention to an opportunity to love and heal here? Am I paying attention to anything outside of my own internal dialogue? And do I believe that I love and serve a creative God who is consistently giving me chances to love the people around me. Last question today. What's the result of going first? If we can't control the outcome, if we're not trying to change someone, are there any guarantees in doing this hard, hard work? In my own conflict got wrong, like I said, the thing that, when it didn't go my way, I went down into this spiral and into this pit, and I really wanted to stay there. I really did, and feel really sorry for myself. But luckily, I had some friends that wouldn't let me, and they kind of gently, you know, coaxed me out, and they asked me some questions and invited me to kind of peel back the layers of myself, and guess what I found there? A need to please people and have people like me, an inability to really look at this situation from the other person's perspective, a real fear that I wasn't good enough at my own life. And when they saw that, they didn't run. And neither did I. And seeing that and having other people bear witness to that was a gift for me. Would you consider that things not going the way that you planned or wanted them to go could actually be a gift? And I don't mean that in some kind of cliche, warm and fuzzy, you know, way. I mean, really, the opportunity for you to peel back the layers of yourself and to break through the shell that you've created to keep people out, that is really the best gift you could get. Because God didn't create you for some set of outcomes. You know, for a job or a clean house or a really happy face all the time, or a clean junk drawer. I mean, all those things that we're just driven to make happen. That's not why God created you. And God knows that no amount of having a handle on your life or getting things to go the way that you want or looking good, it's never going to lead you down a road to healing and to wholeness. It might make you think that you really have a handle on your life, but it won't lead you to the kind of transformation that God wants for you in your life. God wants you to dig in and discover why you were put on this earth and what's standing in the way of you living into being that person. And when you recognize that you're not in control and you go first anyway, you open yourself up to begin that work and to continue that work of really digging in and trying to figure out, God, why am I here? And what is standing in the way of me really being who you made me to be. And that's the only work that you and I can commit to doing, our own, our own work with God. God's not asking you to do that work alone. God gives you chances and opportunities every day to pay attention to your life and be formed by it. And God stays with you in that, even when you have to face down some really ugly stuff. Because what happens when you pull back the layers? You know, what's there? Anger, cynicism, greed, lust, indifference, despair, pain. Those things underneath the surface so often motivate us in our lives to do what we do, to say what we say, and they're not neutral. They're really toxic. They're toxic to us, and they're toxic to others. Those are the things that are standing between who you are now and who God wants you to be. And so it really is a gift when you get to stare those things down. When you and others get to see them for what they are. The gift of going first is not that another person will become who you think they should be. It's that you will become who you were created to be. Parker Palmer says in his book, Let Your Life Speak, why must we go in and down? Because as we do so, we will meet the darkness that we carry within ourselves, the ultimate source of the shadows that we project onto other people. But if we ride those monsters all the way down, we break through to something precious, to the unified field, our complex and inexplicable caring for each other, to the community we share beneath the broken surface of our lives. I think this is what Jesus is talking about in Luke 9 you don't know what kind of spirit you are of for the son of man did not come to destroy men's lives but to save them beneath the broken surface of your life all that junk keeping you from really living there is a current of air that brings life it brought life to you it can bring life to others so go first dig in and discover that essence don't retaliate when things don't go your way be the first to love to serve, to heal so the why of going first is really the discovery of who we are and why we're here and that's God's constant invitation to us all and we're not doing that on our own trying to copy what Jesus did looking at the life of Jesus trying to do it because the bottom line is in the same way that Jesus went first and showed us how to go first he continues to go first for us and with us right here, right now. Jesus continues to make a new way for us. To repent, to change our mind, to be forgiven for sin, to do it different next time, to be gentle with ourselves, to practice kindness, to forgive, to let go, to do all the things we can't do by ourselves. Jesus continues to pave the way before us with new possibility. and he is in here gently but consistently creating wide open spaces and asking us to step into them. But we have to be paying attention to see them and we so often miss them. It's not because we don't want to see them but it's really, really hard to pay attention in that kind of way because it means you might look stupid if you step into that space. You might make things worse. It might not go your way. You might end up in some sort of downward spiral of shame and self-doubt. You might lose your status as the victim in a situation or your right to resent this person you've resented for years. That kind of stuff is real and we cling on to that stuff to survive. So it's really scary to let go of some of those things and to move into a space that Jesus has created for us. But if you look at the life of Christ, Jesus did not spend a lot of time trying to convince people who had it all figured out and who were on lockdown that there was something more for them. He might have told them that, but for the desperate people, for the people who had ridden their monsters all the way down and were at the end, Jesus dropped everything to go first for them, to see them, to love them, to heal them, to forgive them, to create a space and invite them in. And so if that is you, if you are desperate today, and you feel like you've ridden your monsters all the way down, Jesus is there. Jesus is there. And we'll meet you in that space in a significant way. and we'll go first for you, and we'll go first with you. And if we can believe that, then we can step out and go first even when it's hard, even if we don't know what will happen. Would you believe that Jesus could form something in you? That by looking stupid once in a while, you might learn a little humility. Or that by not knowing what to say when you open your mouth, you might learn some dependence. or that by letting yourself feel some pain, you could also feel joy or that by stepping out in faith and seeing things in a new way that you never have before, you could actually increase your hope in humanity and in the world or that if you let go of outcomes and consider what's possible, you might be more grateful in life. What does humility and dependence and hope and gratefulness do in a person? What does that do in the life of a person? And what does a person who's growing in those areas have to offer the world? A lot. A whole lot. I had this picture this week of these situations that we end up in, and it's like there's these little cyclones spinning everywhere. And there are conversations, there are gossip, there are arguments, relational dysfunction, newspaper articles, political debates, systematic oppression. And some are big and some are small, but they're fueled by all these things we can't see. Pain, anger, greed, fear. And it's like a minefield some days, isn't it? Just walking in the world. And you've kind of got these little storms brewing under the surface in your life. and then you're walking through this minefield and it's like everything just wants to collide all the time. It's so hard not to just jump in. I got one of those emails this week where there was a comment that was, just one sentence of it felt like passive aggressive to me and I totally took it personally. And so I was actually reupholstering this seat cushion in my house with a staple gun, which those things, if you are like upset at all, those things are great. like really just like you squeeze it and it's just so satisfying and as I was doing this I was drafting up the email in my head of what I was going to say you know I'll say that and then that person will feel so bad and they'll see that they were wrong and I did not send the email like thank God which is not to say awesome me because next time you know I might you never know but you know it was like this thing was a little cyclone and it was fueled by something I couldn't see but it was begging me to just jump in there and get caught up in the drama. Why do we do that? A friend said this week, you know, we actually are addicted to that kind of drama. We all want something to talk about with intensity. And if you need proof, reality TV. Right? I mean, seriously, like, we want to watch the train wreck that is other people's lives. And we know we should look away, but we kind of can't, even though we know what's going to happen. We're kind of addicted to problems and to drama. And so it's really hard not to get caught up in every dramatic situation that happens, whether it's on the freeway or at Target or at work or at home or in an email. This is the reason that I consistently try to win fights with my four-year-old. And I get in power struggles with her every day. And I know it is not going to work. And the more fired up I get, the worse things I'm going to get. And I do it anyway. Every single day. But if we're serious about learning to go first, to stay in the process of our own healing and becoming whole, we have to be first to say, I'm not going to get in there with you. I'm not diving in. That doesn't mean indifference. that doesn't mean we ignore the situation or we don't respond. It just means we say, I'm not going to dive in and get caught up in all that drama that's swirling around. Because all that is going to do is make this thing swirl faster. You know, wounded people just wound other people. So you take a passive-aggressive comment in an email and you raise it to shaming and then they raise you to, you know, humiliation and then gossip and slander. It just goes on and on. You know, where does it go? it just starts swirling faster and faster but people who are healing they reach out and look for ways to love and heal others so instead of adding to the chaos they look to love well in those situations and when we go first instead of increasing the speed of destruction in our world that cyclone loses a little bit of speed even if things don't go the way that we want them to go it doesn't get any bigger. It doesn't get any bigger. What if we did that? What if we did that in our relationships? What if we did that at work? What if we did that in the world? What if we did that in politics? I said it. What would happen? What would be the result if we just weren't constantly jumping in and getting caught up in all of the drama? Colossians 3 is about doing some really hard things first. Submit, love, obey, respect. Be about other people instead of yourself. Let go of outcomes and do something hard, trusting God. And these things are possible because of that spirit, that pneuma that lives within us, that breath, that current of air. That spirit makes it possible for us to do a lot of hard things. Like breaking the silent treatment on a Saturday by saying, I don't know what to say right now, but can we just talk about this? At 7 a.m. maybe, or 9. You know, it allows you to respond to that email and say, hey, thanks for checking in, and if there's anything else you want to talk about, I'm totally available. It allows you to go to that person at work that you can't stand and everyone else talks about all the time and say, hey, did you want to get lunch sometime this week? It allows you to go through your day and make actual eye contact with every person that you encounter, even if it's only for five seconds, to say, you matter. That spirit that is within you allows you to go first and reminds you of who you are and who Christ is. It lets you choose to redraw the circle even when someone else is trying to shut you out. We can't offer this to everyone all the time. We'd go crazy. We'd be really tired. But I would much rather put my energy towards answering the question, is this my time to go first? And if so, what would that look like? Than being so caught up in my own process and my own feelings and judgments that I'm not even paying attention to anything that's happening around me. I'd much rather put my energy towards asking the question, is this my time to go first, and what could that look like? And we ask that question believing that something really great happens in us and around us. When we choose humility over knowing it all. When we choose hope over despair. When we choose love over fear. Inclusion over exclusion. Gratefulness over cynicism. We go first believing that the restoration inside of us in our souls is really the best catalyst we have to participate in God's restoration in the world. And ultimately we go first believing that the Christ in us continues to go for us first and with us as we go first. I want to close by having you stand. And I'd love to read an excerpt from St. Patrick's breastplate over you. And so as you go today and you think about, you know, what does it look like for me to go first? Know that you're not alone and receive this invitation. People of Open Door, may Christ shield you today. Christ with you. Christ before you. Christ behind you. Christ in you. Christ beneath you. Christ above you. Christ on your right. Christ on your left. Christ when you lie down, Christ when you sit, Christ when you stand, Christ in the heart of everyone who thinks of you, Christ in the mouth of everyone who speaks of you, Christ in every eye that sees you, Christ in every ear that hears you. Amen. you
