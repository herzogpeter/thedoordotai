Lord, I thank you for putting in our hearts a desire for you. I thank you for putting in our hearts a hunger and thirst for righteousness and a desire to be more conformed to the image of Jesus Christ. And that comes from you. That's not our own doing. It's not our own production. That's a gift from you, and we thank you for it. Lord, we pray tonight that you'd fan that hunger, fan that desire, fan it even into a stage of desperation where we're desperate for you. Because in truth, we are desperate for you whether we know it or not, whether we feel it or not. Make us desperate for you, Lord, that we can't live without you, that we're perfectly addicted to you, and that a day is terribly incomplete that isn't spent in your presence. fan that hunger that you've placed within us Lord God to give us the motivation to begin to come against the flesh to give us the motivation to be willing to suffer for righteousness sake and to run the race and if needs be to beat our body into submission and to bring every thought captive unto Christ Lord this is work but it's work that is energized by you when you fan our desperate need for you, Lord. And so I just pray that you'd fan it. Otherwise, Lord God, it's all a surface thing. It becomes a gimmick. It becomes a formula that is not life-giving or life-expressing at all. So, Lord, we need your spirit to be here and to do the inside work. I relinquish myself from the need to do that. I, Lord, as you know, often want to take that job for myself and I think that I can talk people into something, but I can't. And so, Lord, I relinquish that and receive your gift of freedom, freedom from the responsibility to change people. Free me, Lord God, just to share thoughts and to receive insights from others. Free us, Lord God, to share with one another and to be honest about our lives. Let your spirit really dwell in this place, Lord, in this classroom tonight. and confront us. We pray in your name. Amen. We left off last week talking about fasting, and we went over some of the benefits from fasting, the physical benefits of fasting, and we got into a very strange talk on enemas. I found out that there are churches that do talk about enemas and even split over enemas but anyways, there are a lot of physical benefits to fasting it cleanses your body it gives your digestive tract a rest it purges you of a lot of the poisons that we take in and there are many medical people who say that our digestive tract is only geared to eat every other day. We talked about it as a means of rightly prioritizing our life, of putting our life into order, of stressing the spirit over the body. We, in our culture especially, very frequently, become slaves to our body. We maybe don't know that, or maybe you do know that. Maybe there's some physical addiction that you're a part of that you know that you're a slave to something. But even when we don't know that, it's very frequently the case that we're a slave to our body. Because the cultural message that we are bombarded with and can be inebriated with is that our body comes first. Our body needs come first. And that pleasure is sort of the highest thing you can get out of life. Fasting is one way of declaring war upon that deceitful assumption. It's a way of saying, no, I will not be a slave to my body. I tell my body what to do. It doesn't tell me what to do. Our bodies were given for this purpose. They're supposed to be a tool that we have. We are spiritual beings who inhabit a body, and that's part of who we are. But our physicality, our physicalness, is there to serve us as a way of interacting in this world and accomplishing the purpose that God wants for us in this world. We are not to be slaves to it. And so apart from any other spiritual blessings you might get, it's good just to do it, even if it's miserable for you, it's good to once a week or once a month or however you're led to just periodically get checked. Take check, take inventory, and deny your body what it craves. Your body will whimper. Your body's a baby. It will. Some of you fasted today, and right around noon usually, it starts saying, come on, and starts trying to do tricks with your thoughts, saying, oh, come on, You're taking this too seriously. It's not really that big thing. All I want is one donut or one sandwich. And it starts whimpering and you just got to say, shut up. For today, I'm boss. And that's a way of establishing right priorities. It increases a sense of dependency on God. This is something that I have noticed today especially. And, again, it's good to journal while you do this, to take an inventory of your thoughts, to articulate your thoughts, to express them as you're going through. And what I came up with today was that when I fast, I find that I'm out of sync a little bit. I feel a little bit alienated. And I was exploring that thought today because I really did feel somewhat alienated today. And I think it's because I'm used to being well-fed. I have a niche. I have a groove. My personality moves in this little realm where if I'm well-fed and things are basically taken care of, I have a face that I wear, and it's kind of my personality, and I carry it around. But when I fast, I'm out of my niche. There's something wrong. There's something a little bit not right. And I can't rely on my old stuff. It's like it throws me off. I'm missing a beat. I'm out of rhythm. And it throws me out of my normal security. There's one thing there that's not quite right, and there's one thing there that I have to think about. I find in my interactions with people, I have to think more before I talk. Usually when I'm talking with people, I don't think before I talk, which is a problem. But it just kind of comes out, and I'm kind of together. I just got my own thing going. But when I fast, I'm out of my rhythm, and that's a good thing to be. I find that I'm not quick. I'm not in a joking mood as much. I premeditate what I say. I'm not sure of myself. I got into a conversation today where two guys were kind of cutting me down. I do a lot of that. And usually I just come right back, and I've got a lot of things to say. I was like, off. I wasn't rolling with the punches. And I think they were a little taken aback that I'm not slamming them while they're slamming me. But that's a good thing because it means that I can't rely on myself as much. Become more God-reliant. It increases your sense of dependency. It helps focus prayer. And Lori gave us some physical explanations for that. What was that called? Asympathy? Sympathetic and parasympathetic. Two words that you certainly want to remember. But it means that you free up some of your blood resources to think and to go to your brain. Increases in empathy towards the hungry. Just this morning I read one more article on, how do you pronounce his name, Somalia? What's it called? Somalia. And you read that where these people are dying 250 to 400 a day. And just read some of those accounts. And there's no way we can genuinely know what they feel. But this is one way of keeping in our minds something about their plight and maybe praying for them. Whereas otherwise, if we're well fed, we tend to forget about the hungry. This is a way of keeping it in your mind that there are hungry people out there. And when you feel like eating, it's good to remember them and to just, in some small way, enter into a little bit of their suffering, and enter into solidarity with them and pray for them. And finally, it frees resources to help the poor. If you do this on a regular basis, that's one day of eating or one meal of eating or three days of not eating, however much you fast, that you have resources now to maybe invest in helping the poor. Okay, how to do it? This is where we left off. I'll just say a couple things about that. It's important to check your motivation. Why are you doing it? make sure that you're not doing it to get points. That will always backfire on you. Whenever you do anything to get points, even if you do it and you get points for it, it will end up backfiring on you. This isn't about a point-getting thing. It's about aspiring to be more like Christ, and it's about bringing our body into subjection. It's about growing spiritually. But there's no points involved. God doesn't like you more for it. It's just that you're, potentially at least, opening yourself up for more of God. Who should not fast? We said a word about that. If you're physically, if you're at all, if the doctor says don't do it, if you've got any kind of hearty ailment or whatever, don't fast. If you have problems, if you have any kind of eating disorder, and I'd even say if you have any kind of recent history with an eating disorder, like in the last two or three years, I wouldn't recommend fasting at all. First, get very, very healthy with regard to your relationship with food before you embark on a fast. There are different kinds of fast. The Bible, neither the Bible nor church history gives us any kind of one definition of what fasting is. You know, there was a tradition, there is a tradition in Catholicism during Lent, you give up something. That was initially a kind of a fast. And what it usually is, is you take something that's dear to you, maybe chocolates or something like that, and you go without it for 40 days. And it's not a bad principle if your motivation for doing it is to rightly prioritize your life and to not be a slave to anything. That's a good thing to do. But that was not a total fast. That was a selective fast. You fast from something. Paul talks about this in 1 Corinthians 7, when he says that a husband and wife should indulge one another physically, unless there are occasions where they decide to abstain from sex for the purpose of fasting and praying. And so that's another form of fasting. You just deny yourself something which comes sort of natural. A fairly standard fast throughout church history is simply to abstain from solids for a given period of time. You might start with one meal, or you might start with a day, and you just drink liquids. Some people say, well, you shouldn't take in any kind of calories. Just drink water. Other people say that any kind of liquids are okay. Just don't eat solids. I mean, there's no rule on this. And you feel your way forward on that. I always get the most benefit out of it for certain reasons. And this is purely carnal. But I've only once in my life gone on a fast where I didn't drink any coffee. And that didn't do me any good at all. I need at least one cup in the morning to get going. So I fast from five cups, but I have one cup, just to kind of jumpstart the engine. Or sometimes, you know, I'll pop. You'd make this into a legalistic thing if you came up with a way that you have to fast. There is no one way to fast. It's something you've got to kind of choose for yourself. Also with the duration of fast. A 24-hour period is a standard fast. It has been throughout church history. There are three-day fasts where people decide they're going to go for three days without that. And we talked a little bit about that last week, too. Seven-day, 21-day. There's any length of duration here. Again, there's no one way to do it. You have to decide what you're trying to accomplish and decide on that for yourself. To start off with, I would start with a 24-hour period. Or maybe just start with a meal if you haven't done this at all. And then go to a 24-hour period. And then maybe go to a 48-hour fast. and then maybe try a 72-hour fast. Work your way up to it, because it takes a little getting used to. What I would like to do in this class, for those who want to do it, I've recommended fasting on Wednesdays throughout this class. We have four sessions left, right? I'd like to go one day a week next Wednesday. But then, for those who want to be a part of this, For the second to the last class, I'd like to propose a two-day fast, where you take Tuesday and Wednesday off. Because I want to be able to talk about it on Wednesday, so do a Tuesday and Wednesday. And then the final week, maybe go on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, for those who want to be a part of that. Okay. What I'd like to do is to ask you if you have any feedback about fasting today. For those who were part of that, who partook in a fast today, do you have any comments or any feedback or any insights that you got from fasting today? What worked, what didn't work? Anybody? Yeah. That's a good point. That's good. I would recommend and this also was a pretty standard procedure through our church history is to pray during the times that you would normally be eating but again I don't want to get a rule with that but I find that as long as I'm fasting I want to get the most out of it and I get a lot out of it when I pray more so I try to set aside the day not only to fast but as much as possible to pray and to interact with the Lord that's a good point yes But the same kind of reasoning could be used with prayer. Prayer can be turned into a kind of a vending machine sort of thing, where God's a vending machine, and if we just pray enough or the right way or with enough people, then we'll crank the slot and it's going to come out. And of course, it doesn't work like that. It's the same thing with fasting. As I shared last week, there is a number of examples of fasting for a purpose. Fasting especially to seek God's will, to find direction. There's also two verses in the Bible, but they're spurious. It's not clear whether they're part of the original text or not. But where Jesus is talking to his disciples about a demon that they couldn't cast out. And then they ask the Lord, why couldn't we cast this demon out? And the Lord says, certain kinds don't come out except by prayer and fasting. But whether that's part of the original text or not isn't too important because the principle of fasting for a purpose is, I think, a real genuine part of Scripture. Now, how that works is very hard to theologize about. You know, I don't think it's the sort of thing where you're saying, you know, God, I am doing so much for you, now you've got to do something for me. In fact, I'm sure that that's not what's going on there. And so, why ever, why ever, why ever fasting works, it doesn't have to do with that. With regard to getting direction from the Lord, I think that part of what a fasting does is it clears your mind to hear from God. And that's why the primary purpose of fasting, when a purpose is given for fasting in Scripture, is to hear from God. Or sometimes it's connected to a spiritual empowerment. I don't think it's a matter of saying, I give up this, now you give me this, but it's a matter of putting yourself in a position where you are able to receive more from God. You're able to see clearer, hear clearer. Your flesh is less in the way so that maybe you can be spiritually empowered in ways that you couldn't be before. Beyond that, I really don't know why fasting works for certain things, but I think the principle is a biblical one. Sometimes when you're going to preach, when there's a major spiritual thing coming up to preach to a certain person or you're praying for a certain person's salvation, I think fasting is very appropriate. But now how in the mechanics of heaven that works, I'm not sure. The same issue, though, accompanies prayer. Why does prayer work? Are you trying to convince God to do something he doesn't want to do? Prayer works. We can theologize about why it works, but the main thing we need to know is that it does work, and it's very important, and things hang on it. But exactly how it works, when you pray for someone's salvation, are you asking God to coerce their will or what? All we know is there's power in prayer. There's power in prayer. pray a lot and pray with as many people as possible when my dad was considering becoming a christian man every person i met i you know every believer i met i said pray for my dad pray for my dad i just got everyone praying for him now why the numbers thing is is important i don't know but there's a scriptural principle behind it get everyone to pray the whole church comes together and pray and and you bombard heaven and that releases power that otherwise wouldn't be released I think something similar could be said for fasting. The thing about it is it doesn't go away. Ordinarily, you'll forget about the fact that you're fasting for a while, but it comes back to you. And it raises your consciousness. It makes you more in touch with spiritual things. Because normally, like when I'm in my niche, God's only a part of that to the extent that I'm used to having God a part of that. But when you're out of your niche and you're fasting and things aren't quite right, you're just much more aware of your day, much more aware of time, much more spiritually in tune with things. Yes? Okay, that's a good question. It will deter your physical activity. Today I went to jog and lift weights. But I've done this before, so I knew what to expect. And it's just really tough. You know, you do a bench press and you're kind of like, whoo. And you go off for a run and you feel real lethargic. There are other people who I've read in running journals and stuff who actually fast before they run for a given period of time. And it seems to energize them. One day fast maybe wouldn't affect it that much. Although I wouldn't give blood while you're fasting. I made that mistake once and that's not good. he might not get up off the table but after a three-day fast you can you have you have extra energy i find you have extra energy to go about your ordinary everyday stuff but when it comes to physical exertion you feel like a piece of lead especially like running or something like that Yes. Good. Yeah, I found today also that there's a calmness about me when I'm doing this that there normally isn't. And I don't know if that's a... My energy level is on one level down. My energy for extroversion is down. My energy activity. Yeah, yeah. It's not about me, it's about being a conduit. Right. Sure. Sure. And in my dialogues with people, I found I listened better. I don't know. That maybe ties in, for me anyways, it tied in a little bit with what we saw last week about the relationship between fasting and humility. I found that humility kind of came more natural. Just kind of being in a listening mode and putting yourself beneath someone. It just sort of seemed to happen. Okay, good. Anyone else? Yeah. For me, it was a constant reminder that I can't always have my own way. Okay. Confronting a real cultural assumption that you're supposed to, with regard to your body, you're supposed to always have your own way. I want food, I get food. And we normally, in this culture, we're only a part of one-third of the world that can do that, but whenever we want food, we usually get it. And this is a good way of putting that in priority. Okay, anyone else? All right. I would like it if you would like it to do this every Wednesday. There's also something that helps when you know other people are fasting with you. There's kind of a solidarity there that you're not alone. And it kind of just helps. And then in two weeks, let's try a two-day thing. Okay. I wanted to say, we're going to get into some prayer, some centering prayer stuff for tonight. But the next discipline I want to talk about was honesty. And in some ways this sounds like a weird spiritual discipline. And there is no writer throughout church history that talks about honesty as a separate discipline. But what I've done is sort of extrapolate certain principles that come up in the spiritual writings throughout church history and grouped them under the title of honesty. And I think you'll see what I'm talking about shortly. The church is called to be, and those who are around here very much know this very well, the church is called to be the community of truth. The community of truth. That's one of the most essential things the church is called to be. And the word truth in Greek is aletheia, which means unhiddenness. A is the word not. Lanthanos is to conceal. So aletheia is actually alanthanos. It means to not be concealed. The church is called to be the place where things are not concealed, where things are open, where people speak truth to one another in love. A key passage for this whole thing is found in Ephesians chapter 4. Where Paul says this, Now he's talking about building up the church, and he goes, verse 14, Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching, and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. In contrast to any kind of deceit, Paul says, Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the head, that is Christ. Speaking the truth in love. And then in verse 25 again he says this, Therefore, each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully, speak openly, speak honestly to his neighbor, for we are all members of one another. The next two verses are pretty insightful too. In your anger do not sin. It's interesting that he talks about anger as soon as he talks about being honest. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry. That would be deceitful. You're pretending like you're not angry when you are. Deal with it openly, honestly. And verse 27, and do not give the devil a foothold. How do you give the devil a foothold? It's not by being angry. It's by letting the sun go down on your anger and pretending like you're not angry when you are. And believe me, that gives the devil a foothold because that turns into bitterness and all sorts of things in your life get screwed up. The church is called to be the community of truth. In James 5.16, James tells us to confess our sins to one another. Confess our sins to one another. And I used to have this idea that that means you're supposed to get up in front of a congregation and say, oh, I sinned. And it's kind of like pulling teeth. Come on, what are your sins? Tell me. Inquiring minds want to know. But I don't think it's that at all. I think this is synonymous with saying speak the truth to one another. Because if you speak the truth to one another, you're going to be confessing your sins. Because the truth is that we're sinners. The church should be, it needs to be, the place where truth is spoken. And where sin is confessed and where sin is dealt with. And this requires a distinct discipline because in our flesh this does not come natural to us at all. Here's the value of this. First, let's do it with the sin of hypocrisy. Think about it for a second. What was the thing that Jesus most harped on? Or who were the people that he most harped against? In fact, who were the only class of people that Jesus really got righteously ticked off at? It wasn't the adulterers. It was the Pharisees. His main accusation against them was that they were hypocrites. The word hypocrisy simply means duplicity. Duplicity. Being on the outside something other than what you are on the inside. That's hypocrisy. And that is a very damaging thing. It's damaging for one thing because we weren't meant to live like that. We were created to be like little kids. Maybe this is part of what Jesus means when he says become his little children. Little kids are on the outside until they learn not to be this way. They are on the outside what they are on the inside. They're honest. They say things that are truthful. And sometimes that embarrasses us and whatnot. But we're created to be like that. We're created to live in a harmony so that the outside is like the inside, the inside like the outside, and there's a peace about that. To the extent that that is not a reality in our life, to the extent that our outside is different than our inside, we are sick. We're sick. And that's not just a biblical truth, though it is a biblical truth, but it's one that psychologists are very aware of too. John Bradshaw says you are as sick as the secrets you keep. To the extent that you conceal the real you behind a facade of something or other, you're sick. You're wounded. You're living in a way that you were never created to live. There's a disjunction, a gap, a gulf, a caveat between your appearance and the real you, and that causes dysfunction. That causes destruction ultimately. One of the reasons that it causes destruction is that healing requires aletheia. Healing requires aletheia. To the degree that we conceal our real selves, to the degree that we conceal the things, and the reason why we usually conceal them is that we think they're undesirable. We think that people aren't going to like us if they know this about us, or God's not going to like us if he knows this about us, or we're not going to like ourselves if we admit this to ourselves. The reason we do that is because these are the undesirable parts of our life. This is the side that we don't like people to know, the secrets that we keep, the stuff that goes on on the inside that no one else knows about, and we even try to deny about ourselves. But the thing is that those things can never be healed as long as they're concealed. They can't ever be dealt with truthfully. Only when it's out here, only when the inside becomes part of the outside, can we ever begin to reform the inside. See what I'm saying? You can never heal a wound that is concealed. Healing requires that. The result of hypocrisy, it's not just like it's a morally bad thing to do, it's a destructive thing to do because what you need healing from, you'll never get healed from because you're too busy pretending like you don't have that. Honesty is really a necessary thing to have as a part of our life. The final thing is love requires alitheia. And this also ties into why we weren't created to live hypocritically. If my outside is different than my inside, then even if you like me and even if you love me, and we have fellowship with one another, I know in my heart of hearts that it, or at least I will suspect in my heart of hearts, that it's not me that you really love. It's the outside that I presented to you so that you would love me. The love is conditioned. Whenever you have conditional love, conditioned upon a certain kind of external show, the soul goes on being unloved. My innermost heart, the heart that knows all the grimy, junky stuff about me, does not feel loved, even when it is loved, because it's being hidden behind this facade. The analogy that I sometimes use, I use this summer, is that it's kind of like eating a five-course meal and getting all the food stuck in your teeth. The nourishment doesn't go down to the stomach. You're eating it, but it never reaches the place where it needs to reach if it's going to nourish you. It's the same thing with love. If I am doing X, Y, and Z in order to get you to like me, in order to get you to affirm me, in order to get you to love me, and that X, Y, and Z is not a part of who I really am, and if I'm hiding issues A, B, and C in order to present X, Y, and Z before you, then even if I get your love and even if you affirm me, my soul does not feel loved because there's a suspicion that you love me only because I have x y and z and I don't show you a b c I don't show you my my real stuff hang on a second here if we're ever going to feel genuine love it will it can only come in the context of truth speaking only if you know me can you ever really love me and only if you know me can you ever really can I ever really feel loved by you Can we really have fellowship with one another? This is why 1 John 1, a very profound passage of Scripture. John says, walk in the light as he is in the light. Don't let there be any darkness among you. Then he says, if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we purge ourselves from sin. I think part of what that's getting about is up here. When you walk in the light and your dirty laundry is out, at least in some contexts it's out, then you begin to deal with it. and that is what purges you, frees you from that kind of sin. But then he also says, I think it's in verse 9 or 10, that if we walk in the light, we have fellowship with one another. It's only when we're in the light, when the light is turned on in the room, and so you can see everything that's in the room, only then, or only to the extent that that is a reality, do we really have fellowship with one another. Otherwise, what we're having fellowship with is not one another, we're having fellowship with facades. I know your external, you know my external, but we're not having fellowship with our internals, with our soul, with our gut, with what's really real about us. One final word, and then I'll go to your question. The way the enemy, the main means that the enemy uses to destroy us is precisely this secrecy. The soul was created to receive love. The most fundamental thing about the soul is that it needs love. It's the food that it eats. It's the water that it drinks. It needs love. But when it is hidden behind a facade of something or other. It can't get that love, and so the soul begins to starve. It becomes impoverished. It's suffocating, and the enemy uses that to destroy us, to destroy people. This is why I believe that he's called the Prince of Darkness. Why is he called the Prince of Darkness? He's always associated in the Bible with darkness. Is it because hell is a dark place? I think it has more to do with secrecy. It's the opposite of walking in the light. Whether it's hypocrisy, whether it's duplicity, whether it's a gulf between your external self and your internal self. The enemy has room to work, to maneuver, to destroy you. He needs secrecy. But as soon as you come out with stuff, and God's grace allows us to do that because he convinces us through the cross that nothing hangs upon our having the bad stuff, so it's safe to come out with it. When we do that, we take out from under the enemy the main platform he uses to condemn us. If you look at it in your life, all condemnation is a result of him having secrets on you. He starts to condemn you. He starts to erode your self-esteem. He starts to erode your self-confidence because he knows something about you that no one else knows. It begins to just eat away at that and eat away at that. The way to come against that is by walking in the light, coming out with it. And the enemy no longer has it on you. You're dealing with it. It's out here. And you're still affirming. You're still loved. Jesus Christ still loves you in spite of all this stuff out here. You take away from him the main platform that he uses to destroy us. Okay, in the back. sure okay that's a very good point um i i think i'll say a little more about that when i talk about i give recommendations for when this for for how and when this should occur but you're raising a very important principle and that is that it's not always safe to be open and it's not good to be open in a context that that's not safe right right you have and this is this is where they're not real i'm safe i'm safe you what no the church the the church that i i came from uh when i when i first became a christian they still i i i went i went to the pastor one time to talk about some sin that i was struggling with and he still uses that against me now it's totally public you know but but it doesn't bother me at all because i'm public with it too more public than he is. But this is 17 years ago, and because I'm an enemy of the people, because I don't agree with their doctrine, man, it's all over the country. I was at a symposium at Harvard, and this thing came out. Oh, we know you. You're not to be believed, because we know about your stuff. And so, yeah, that was a bad move. If it's going to come over the loudspeaker, it's not a good place to do it. But you need to have a safe context, a context where the spirit of truth, the spirit of Aletheia is present. I'll say a little more about that shortly. Okay, here's the problem with all this, and that is that life in the flesh feeds on deceit, and we are, if we're honest with ourselves, addicted to falsehood. The main deceit is that we want to get life from sources other than the source of life, and that requires of us that we do things that are not natural to get that source of life. And so honesty, genuine honesty, does not come perfectly natural to us. It doesn't come natural at all. We have trouble living like little children where we're just ourselves. Partly because the world's too risky of a place, partly because we get life from not doing that. The discipline of honesty is meant to confront that and to begin to heal us from this addiction to deceit and from the damage that it requires. As it comes out in church history, it looks a little bit like this. Throughout church history, beginning in about the fifth century or so, the church had confession as a regular part of its practice. And this, of course, is still carried on in Catholicism, where you confess your sins to a priest. You don't have to agree with this theologically, that a person has to forgive, that the priest has to forgive your sins if you're going to be okay, that we need another mediator between God and man. I don't agree with that theologically, but there's a true principle in this, and that is that it is good to confess your sins, to have a place, a person for whom you can talk to, and in that context, ideally, that would be redeeming. That is part of what 1 John 1.9 means about being purged from your sins. If you tell me some stuff about yourself and yet I love you, I am, as it were, a symbol of Christ's love for you, that you're, in fact, loved unconditionally, that you don't need to hide yourself in order to be loved. And I can represent, I can be a concrete symbol for you for what Christ thinks about you, that he forgives you. That's what the community of believers is about. We should love each other like Christ loves us. And that's one way of affirming ourselves, that, in fact, we are loved that much. The bit about having to, you know, the priest having to absolve you, whatever, I don't agree with. But the confessional part of it is really good. Here also there's a need. I mean, this can really be abused. It needs to be in a safe context. When I receive first confession, did anyone else here receive first confession? Hang on a second. Okay, it's a big deal, isn't it? The Catholic Church is like the biggest deal. You bring all your relatives and your grandma and your grandpa and all your friends, and they're going to hear your first confession? Well, they did that with me. we were a good Catholic family, and I went to first confession, but I really was, I got this in third grade, but I had been an unbelievably raunchy kid up to third grade, it was, you wouldn't believe, if I told you, because I had around my older brother, and he was involved with older people, so I was like a seven-year-old running around with 12-year-olds, and really doing stuff at seven-year-olds, I look at my son, who's six, and I can't believe that what I was doing when I was his age, when we had stripping clubs, we had smoking clubs, we had all these other kind of clubs, but I want to get this off my chest so bad, I was just like, oh, I want to be forgiven, I was afraid I was going to die and go to hell. Just waiting for confession to come along. So finally confession comes along, my first confession, and I go into this, the confessional, and you know my personality. I start like, oh, and Father, I did this, and then I did that, and then I did this. And periodically the priest would say, well, you can talk quieter. I can hear you very well. And so, oh, yeah, yeah, okay. So I'd start quiet again, but then I'd start getting worked up, you know. And then I did this. I had this thing cataloged. I mean, I've been waiting for a year to get this off my chest, So I had every minute, a couple of days he says, okay, can you abbreviate it a little bit? First confession is not so big. Anyways, I finally unloaded all of his stuff, and he gave me all the prayers I was supposed to do, and I walked out of the confessional, and the nun comes over to me, and she puts her arm around me and says, Greg, next time you can talk a little quieter. And I look up, and the back, like five rolls of this humongous cathedral, these parents are all like grabbing their kids, like looking at this Damian part three. My reputation. Stay away from that kid, Johnny. He's bad news. So make sure that you do it in a safe context. In monasteries, the abbot would play this role, where the people in the monastery would go and they'd just talk openly and honestly to the abbot. Martin Luther used to drive his abbot crazy, because even though you'd think that spending your whole day in a monastery in prayer, your potential for really bad sin would be somewhat limited, but Luther would confess six hours a day. He was so introspective and so aware of his thoughts. Everything had to come out. He was driving his abbot crazy, and that's why his abbot sent him to Rome, which eventually resulted in his starting a Lutheran church. But there's this policy of it's good for people to confess. During the Reformation, they had prayer groups, support groups they started, which replaced the confessional element in Catholicism, where people would get together and pray, and they'd read the Bible, and they'd talk to one another. They'd talk openly and honestly with one another, support groups, And that's continued on in various ways until today. And finally, journaling, which I mentioned last week, has been, at least in certain segments of Christendom, a regular practice. The Puritans made an art out of this. If you want to see some fascinating reading, go and read some of the journals of Jonathan Edwards or John Woolman or some of these people. Man, they were introspective. I mean, they just knew where they were at in terms of their sinfulness and stuff. And sometimes it was a little bit morbid. but the practice itself of being honest with yourself. That's what journaling is about, is just being honest with yourself. Sometimes that's the hardest thing to do, is to really be honest with where you're at, instead of trying to kid yourself and live in denial. Okay, someone had a question over here. That's true. Yeah, integrity has a price. I think that's... Okay, good. A couple of recommendations. In prayer. There's a tremendous need to be honest in prayer. I'm sorry if you can't read this. It just says in prayer, a couple of things that help me be honest in prayer. The first is to reaffirm who Christ is, that he loves you unconditionally. To take whatever else you're feeling, but to take the biblical truth that Christ loves you unconditionally and that all your sin has been paid for, and to initially reaffirm that. There's nothing that you're going to say that's going to be used against you. It's been taken care of. Sometimes I just go back and read Colossians 2, 15, and 16, where all the things that were written against me, all the ordinances that were against me have been nailed to the cross. And that's why the Bible says that Jesus made an open mockery of Satan because he's no longer got anything on me. Reaffirm that you can talk to Christ openly and honestly, and he's not going to use it against you. He wants you to do that to heal you because it has to come out for your sake to be healed. He's not going to use it against you. What I do then is in prayer, Catalog my sins in an objective way. That is to say, given the fact that now they're not going to be used against me on the judgment day, and given what I know about Christ, that he loves me unconditionally and accepts me unconditionally, to now take inventory, to look at myself realistically, objectively. I become like a third party, and I just analyze myself. Where am I really at? That's what I want to know. Where am I really at? Because I know that I'm very good at deceiving myself, at kidding myself, at pretending like I'm not what I really am. The duplicity isn't just about my external self and internal self. The duplicity is on the inside, living in denial. It's real important for our healing to become aware of our sinfulness. This isn't done to make yourself feel miserable. And that's why we did the first thing. Your salvation is totally settled, and therefore it's safe for you to be very aware of your sinfulness. The purpose of becoming aware of your sinfulness is to grow out of it. But first you have to be aware of it. See that it's there. In fact, that will even convince you more of Christ's love for you because you come out and you say it and the Lord comes back to you and says, Yeah, I still love you. I still love you. And now your soul, finally, not a facade, but your soul is beginning to get fed. Your soul is beginning to drink of what it was made to drink from. It's beginning to feel loved. And that's what will begin to empower you to grow out of your sin. Actually, if your self-esteem and your sense of worth is based on your ability to not notice bad parts about yourself, it's a very shallow self-esteem. In fact, it is itself a facade. It's not a real thing. You don't know the glory of self-esteem. You'll never experience what real self-worth is like until you can take all of the most dismal things about you, your thought life, the things you wouldn't tell your spouse maybe, and you bring it before the Lord, and you see that he loves you anyways. Now you have worth, because you have a worth that's based on what he thinks about you, and not your ability to pretend like you're something other than you are. So catalog your sins objectively. Go through them. Be honest about them. Exactly as you are. Maybe you've got stuff here that you don't even want to change. That's sin. The fact that you like it more than you like God. Be honest about that. You'll never be healed from that sin. Your wants will never change until you allow the Lord to love you amidst the sin that's there. And finally, I bring up once again journaling. Stuff might come to you. You might discover things about yourself. As you're letting the Lord love you freely and is beginning to feel safe in a time of prayer, you might discover things about yourself that you never saw before, ways that you are hypocritical that you weren't aware of before. Write them down. Just become aware of them and let the Lord love you through them, and that's what will begin to effective change such that you'll grow out of them. the first thing is to become very real with them and honest with them all right um yeah i i i keep it uh because it's really good in five years to go back and look and see what you're struggling with see where you've grown see where you haven't grown maybe see where you digressed but uh it's good to you know we're on a project here and one very important thing otherwise you forget you forget where the lord's brought you from and then we keep on saying you know we do with prayer a lot. We say we pray for things to be answered, then we forget about them. The Lord answers them, but we never give them the glory for it because we forgot about it. It's really good to keep a catalog of where you've come from. It's like kids growing up. When you see them every day, you don't notice that they're growing. But then the relatives come over and they say, oh, you shot up so big. But see, it's been centimeter by centimeter, and so it's so slow that you don't notice it. But same thing with this. You grow by centimeter by centimeter, And you go forward, backward, forward, backward. But if you're just in touch with where you are in the present, you don't really notice how far you've grown. So it's good to keep it. Still, it's kind of scary. You have to maybe get a lock on it or something like that. I don't know. And before I die, I'm going to destroy them, so it won't not go down in history. I don't want the memoirs of Greg Boyd published. Here's what it was really like, you know. yes good it's all the work of god when this stuff comes out because the bible says jeremiah 17 3 that our hearts are desperately wicked our hearts don't want to know themselves we like self-denial living in denial something now in a bad sense we let we gravitate towards hiddenness we live in the flesh and anytime truth is told even to yourself that's the work of god it's the holy spirit working in there. So above all else, be saying, Lord, search my heart. I always, whenever I, we'll be talking more about this when we talk about resting the Lord, but whenever I come in the presence of the Lord, I immediately have a defense thing that kind of comes up. Not always, but very frequently, where I'm just, I sense that I'm in the presence of an all-holy God. I look into his eyes, and I know that he knows me inside and out. And immediately that makes me want to kind of back off. But if I can just put down my arms and say, know me, search me, oh God, like David says, search me, because it's safe to do that because of the cross. And that's why you've got to keep going back to the cross. Then some stuff comes out.
