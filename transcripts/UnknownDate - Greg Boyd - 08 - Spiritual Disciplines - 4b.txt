And that killed me. I mean, that was just a major indictment. I mean, that's as catastrophic for a, you know, a three-year-old kid as a divorce as to an adult. And here's an authority, the people who know, you live your life just asking the question, what am I worth? What's my value? Who am I? And here comes the voice, the decisive voice, that says you're a bad kid and you don't get presents. Well, there was a time when the Lord brought me back to that memory. It actually was stirred up because something similar happened in my house. where a person forgot to bring my son a present. And it just overwhelmed me. I was just overcome with this feeling. And I didn't know why because it wasn't that big of a deal. But that kind of jarred the memory. I'd forgotten about this thing. And I later on, after I remembered this, called around to my sister and my father to ask, did this happen? And they all remember it happening. Well, here's the stage that we went through. The first one was the grieving stage where I would just go back to this time and I would simply cry because something died. Something beautiful died. part of me died that day some of my creativity my some of my love for life my zest for life some of my energy a lot of my thoughts about myself died i i it was it was a killing i took that day and and it's appropriate when a little kid dies to cry and and so part of what what we do is simply grieve over that and that's a healing thing you just grieve and jesus would grieve with me that that shouldn't have happened and and we just we just mourn over this but that's not a stopping point. It's not healthy to make that a stopping point. It's a necessary point, and maybe it's going to be prolonged for a while, but that's not the stopping point. A second stage I've found happens when you're empowered to do something about it. See, as a little two and a half, close to three year old kid, I wasn't in the position to, I didn't have the knowledge, and I didn't have the character, I didn't have the background to stand up against her, to say that's not true. I thought everything that Grumps say was true. That's your assumption. I wasn't in an empowered position. And so her words were decisive upon me, and that to some degree destroyed some of my personhood. Some of my personhood that God created me to have was destroyed with that. Well, now what needs to be done is for me to regain that personhood, and that's synonymous with saying to regain some power back, to regain the ability to come up against the message that she brought to me. The first time that this happened, and what I found is that in the healing of memories, these stages don't go necessarily chronological, And they don't necessarily go done with stage one, going to stage two. They go back and forth. There's no clear order here. But the first time this happened was we were there. We went back maybe the third or fourth time I'd ever gone back to this memory. And I was crying as this little boy was crying. And Jesus would sometimes cry also over this whole thing. And then Jesus said, Greg, do you have something you want to say to your grandmother? And at first, I remember, and I talk now in my little boy's voice. I say I can't I'm afraid to you know she's grandma you're not supposed to talk back to grandma and Jesus would say well it's okay now because I'm in charge here and grandma listens to me now and you can say whatever you think you need to say and then Jesus went over to the little boy and whispered some things in his ear I was just watching this now and at first the little boy was resistant to it but gradually he sort of said and he looked up, and Jesus was encouraging him this whole time, and he said, you shouldn't say that about me. You're not being a nice grandma when you say that. That's not true. What Jesus says is true, and what you're saying is not true, and you shouldn't do that. And he began to just say stuff, and my grandmother would just sit here and listen to it. And gradually the little boy got kind of big, holding onto Jesus' hand now, but he got kind of bold about it, and Jesus would even join in. and then a lot of anger, a lot of anger arose to the service, a tremendous amount of anger. It was all expressed in the voice of this three old boy, but there's a tremendous amount of anger there. Do you know what repercussions what you said had in my life? Do you know the subsequent pain you caused me and that I caused other people because of what you said? Do you have any idea the damage that you did and just bam, start wailing? And it needed to be, and Jesus would join in there. He was more ticked off than I was. He'd be just joining in there and together we're ganging up on my grandma. but it's a healing thing it's something that needs to be done something that needs to be done my grandmother's been dead for 25 years so there's nothing I can say to her personally now and it maybe would be appropriate if she was still alive to now begin to verbalize that with her and begin to say it in real life but it needs to happen in the memory then there comes what I call a reenacting stage and that's where Jesus actually begins to reverse the memory this is happens you know there's no set way this happens you know our memories are as diverse as we are from each other and the way the lord heals them is as diverse i'm just giving a general pattern here and i'm just giving one illustration of how this this kind of healing occurs happens a lot of different ways even in my own life but the way healing occurred in this memory was by um we went back to the scene again i i went through kind of a crying stage and i went through an angry stage went through the whole thing but then I found myself looking down in the basket again feeling the grief and just the childish confusion of this whole scene and my sister said once again grandma doesn't Greggy get a present and I look up but this time I don't see my grandmother with her angry face I see Jesus and Jesus is leaning over this bag and Jesus reaches over and kind of fluffs my head, my hair like this. This is why sure Greg gets a present. He's a real special boy. I've got a special present for him and I saved it to last. That's why I saved it to last. So I look back down the back and there's this huge red airplane that I always wanted as a little kid. And I don't ever remember getting it, but there's this huge red airplane. And I just pick it up and I'm just like, as a little kid, just so overjoyed with the whole thing. And I hug him and he keeps saying to me, You're a special boy. You're a special kid. I say, but grandmother said I wasn't. He says, well, your grandmother was wrong. I shouldn't have said that. I say that you're really special. And so what he's doing is he's reversing the memory. He's not changing the past, but he's changing the message of the past. He's reversing the damaging message of the memory. The past is, I know the difference between what happened and what Jesus just did in healing my memory, but he's counteracting the damaging message that was there. He reverses the memory. The final stage I found is the forgiving stage. None of these are stopping points. You haven't let go of the wounding memory until you've forgiven the person that inflicted pain on you in the memory. Bitterness and anger and resentment is at least as strong a way of clutching on to someone as if your pain is clutching onto them. You haven't let go of it until you can forgive. Now, you can't forgive. I don't think you can just forgive up here. Sometimes we say that with forgiveness. Oh, you've got to forgive. You ought to forgive. You better forgive. After all God's done for you, don't you owe it to them to forgive them? And it's not something you can will to do. You can't just try hard to do it. It's got to come naturally out of health, out of wholeness, out of healing. And so it's the final stage where you forgive the person that did the harm for you. And the way it worked in this memory was I'd gone through the whole scene again. And after the bit where I'm looking in and didn't see the present, my sister says, doesn't Greg get a present? I look up and I see Jesus. I get the red airplane, etc. Then there came a time when I, as I was hugging Jesus, I looked over his shoulder and there was my grandmother again. But she looked really different. She didn't have a stern look on her face. she had a kind of calmness about her, a peace to her, but almost a melancholy. And I was kind of surprised. I stepped back with my red airplane, and my grandmother says, Greg, I'm sorry for what I did. I know that now I shouldn't have done it. I was just a silly old woman who was taking the pain of your mom's death out on you. And I don't know why I targeted you, why I blamed you for her death, but it was wrong for me to do that. and what I want to know now is, can you forgive me? And I was in the power position now. I was a person again. I have the ability to forgive or not to forgive. And Jesus didn't force on me either. I look up at Jesus, and Jesus kind of raises his eyes like, what are you going to do, Greg? And after a moment, they're kind of looking back and forth. He kind of just nodded, yes, like, you can forgive her now. And I just looked up at her. I said it's okay now I forgive you Jesus fixed the owie and she said he fixed it for me too and I remember doing something that she never did in real life she came over and she picked me up and hugged me and Jesus came over and kind of embraced us all that memory is gone I mean the pain of that memory is gone maybe it's not because it still gets me worked up but you know what the tears it's not it's not pain tears it's beautiful tears it's it's like you see in all of this here's what happens i see a little bit more clearly how beautiful jesus is how he's unlike anything else in my life his voice is unlike every other voice in my life his eyes are like any of the other eyes i've ever had in my life Isis. You know, his message is totally opposite of the message that I often got in my life, and that just makes me see his beauty. And as I see his beauty, I'm getting it back for myself. I'm seeing my beauty. Not in some kind of weird humanistic sense, but in the sense that I'm in Christ because he loves me because of the value I have. And that's what's causing Christian growth. And out of that can come healing from the tyranny of the message that we have here. I really believe that this is in part what Paul is getting at when he says in 2 Corinthians 10, 5, take every thought captive unto Jesus Christ. Take every thought that's there in the mind, every memory that's there in the mind, all that stuff that's there, all the messages that are there in the mind, and bring them unto the lordship of Jesus Christ. Even when I didn't remember that event, it still influenced me. You're a bad kid. And I can look back at my life now and I can see how that message, it wasn't just from that source, but that kind of got the ball rolling. How that message was just played out in so many different ways. I'm a bad kid. Well, that means I can't get life from being good, so I can get life from being bad. And so much of my life was a process of acting out, being offensive, being ridiculous, being funny, being outlandish as a way of getting attention, as a way of fulfilling my programming. I felt right when I was in trouble. Why? Because I was programmed that way. And who was the authority that programmed me? Well, it started with grandmother. Well, the way to be free from that, it can't come from self-effort. I went two years in a Christian group where this message was perfectly intact, and I was trying to be good, trying to be good, but you can try all you want to be good, but if what's going on in your head is something saying you're bad, you're bad, you're bad, it's just a matter of time before you're going to crack and go out in the opposite direction. You've got to confront deception at the root. And it's got to be as concrete and as powerful and as transforming as the damaging messages are. That's why healing memories can be so beneficial, yeah. Sure. Well, what I've, and I've had to deal with that in my own life as well. I go through this thing just as is. But what I've done is, when I get to the grieving stage and the empowering stage, and the reenacting stage is a private matter. But here, as much as it is within me, as much as I feel led to do, I'm allowed about it. It's part of the discipline of honesty. Whereas I'm empowered to come up against these voices, I say, your message is wrong. You don't have a right to say that. And I think you're incorrect on that matter. I can't be responsible for how they're going to respond. I'll probably just tick them off. But you're not responsible for how they respond. What you're responsible for is getting healthy. And so as you go through this, as you are empowered to do this, bring about in reality what's happening here in your mind. It will be first important for you, however, to be able to see it in your mind. Let the Lord make it a reality in the memory before you can ever do it in actuality. And even with the forgiveness stage, when you are in the position, and I can't emphasize enough that you need to eventually get here. Don't ever stop until you've gotten here because you're doing yourself a great disservice. Forgiveness is freedom, and you're not free until you forgive. But when you get here, I called up my stepmother. I hadn't talked with her for eight years. I kind of combined all these in one. and just said, you know, that the Lord's been working with me on some things. And the interesting thing is that this happened largely through me picturing Jesus or whatever, and I had never read anything about this or whatever. In fact, in the church I was in, that was really not a thing to do. But the Lord had kind of given me the gift of this. I called her up when I was empowered enough after I'd gone through some of this healing, and I confronted her, and then I forgave her. And I fully expected her to not accept that. it was totally uncharacteristic of her to accept it and then to actually ask for forgiveness. And then I asked for forgiveness as well because it's not like I was free from sin in this whole thing. I had harbored bitterness. I had been ungodly. I was being independent. I wasn't totally open to God, so I asked for forgiveness as well. But you can't be responsible for how they respond. You're responsible to do what you have to do. Oh, if this is an ongoing message in your life, well, if it's an ongoing message in your life, something that you're constantly up against, what I think you'd need to do is to grow to the point where the message doesn't have the message it has for you, where you just see this person as being a very troubled person. It's about them, not about you. And that's the whole thing. So you don't need to be constantly being recovered from their damaging messages. If it really is that abusive, then in a case like that, and you can't grow to the point where you can just sort of ignore it and see that these people are telling lies, if it's constantly wounding you, I think about severing the relationship, at least temporarily, until you can get healthy enough where you can live with it. One, two. Okay, that's good. That's a good point. What makes their rejection and their words so cataclysmic is that our identity is invested in them. And that's something that shouldn't be anyways. We need people, but we don't need them desperately. We need God desperately. Because they're resources, but He's source. And so, yeah, as you more align yourself with Christ and get your total sense of being from Him, the less stake you'll have in their words. In the end, you can just kind of see them as... I may be talking about husbands and wives here, so I've got to be careful, as not silly people, but as just saying untrue things. Like, there you go again. You're always tearing me down, but do you know how wrong you are? I'm great. If you're in the environment where it's constantly on you, I don't know what it's like to live in that environment. That's why I couldn't answer you out of experience. But all you can do is you can't be responsible for them. The sun can go down on their anger. Don't let it go down on yours. And so try to release yourself from this as much as possible. Okay, I want to keep saying, you were next and then you. In this particular case, in this particular instance, it was over a year. But I don't want to think, it wasn't like three months, three months, three months, you know, whatever. And this wasn't the only thing that was going on. I sometimes go to meet me with the Lord and we do something else. He gives you as much as you can handle. And so I would deal with it, and then it would be in the back of my mind for a month, and then I'd deal with it again. In fact, overall, it was more like a year and a half. In fact, when I think about it, it was a year and a half for this, but the forgiveness thing happened to me on a retreat about a year ago, and that was three, four years after we first started. I thought it ended here, But on this retreat, all of a sudden, this grandmother thing occurred. And I thought I would have been totally free, but I realized that I hadn't really forgiven her. So there's no typical way. There's other things that kind of happen, though, where I'm just with the Lord, and where an event will come to my mind, and all this happens in one session, in ten minutes. So is that more typical now? Yeah, I'd say it's giving you a report as to where I am right now. That's the more typical. But I've also found this pattern that I go through a period of not dealing with many issues. And then something happens where, whoosh, there's all sorts of issues. And then I go through periods. Where I'm at right now is that most of the stuff is nice and pretty minor. And it's just kind of rehearsing the same stuff, which I enjoy. I can't get enough love. I mean, man, give it to me. Let's go over the same scenes 100 times. I don't mind that at all. But it's not, it's like traumatic or whatever. But I've been in that mode before for about a year, and then something happens where bam, you know, something. I don't think I have any more major skeletons in the closet. But, I mean, like major events that are going to come up, but I can't be sure of that. But, you know, there are some counselors who say that you shouldn't dwell on a memory any longer than you have to. Let it go and never go back to it. Once you're done, you're done, and intentionally not go back to it. There are some Christian counselors that recommend that. I have just not found that to be the case. I enjoy rehearsing this stuff. It just lets me see the beauty of the Lord again. It lets me hear the message once again. And I sometimes go back and think through the bit with the grandmother even. not because there's a dire need to but just because it's beautiful it's like this is good stuff and I it's like you go to see you know I've seen fried and green tomatoes now twice and I'll probably see it a third time it's a great story and so it just shows up Christ's beauty a little bit more so I'm never in a hurry I wouldn't be in a hurry to do this just take your time it is a choice it is a choice the Lord gave me the choice but but if the motivation for it comes out of an external pressure, I don't think that's healthy. I think it has to come, it has to come, you have to be empowered to forgive, which means you have to regain what you have lost to forgive. If you forgive before you've regained what you lost, you're simply empowering the person all the more, and that can be damaging. I think anger has to usually precede forgiveness. But I don't know this particular counselor, But that would be my general rule of thumb. Yes? Exactly. And that's why you need to be patient with it. I still have things. I'm still understanding things about me. Another layer of the onion gets peeled, and I'll realize the effect that something had on me. A lot of times I have a memory of something, but it doesn't seem very big. But all of a sudden, when the Lord peels back a layer of the onion, Not with a new memory, but new feelings to it. It's like all of a sudden, bush, that all of a sudden becomes very significant. It's because there was a lot of feeling there, but I just kind of severed it. And now I'm feeling the memory of it, you know. Okay, you're next on two. Yeah. It's a stage you've got to go through. But none of them are stopping stages. If you stay at this stage or at this stage, it's going to be trouble. It's going to be major trouble because you'll just be living in anger. And anger, it's like it needs to pass through your digestive tract, and then you've got to get rid of it. Because if it stays in there too long, man, you're going to be spiritually constipated. And it starts to rot. It starts to destroy. It's true. Okay, well, let's move on to one other thing here tonight. We've got ten minutes, and I just want to introduce the concept, and then we're going to talk about it next week. yes oh I'm sorry I didn't mean to you'll need to be healed from this memory later on in life you know you it's exactly right it's a quick fix bypass let me just share one little illustration this last summer when I was speaking here at the open door a person came up to me after I had given some talk Oh, it was on Jesus playing freeze tag, that Jesus unfreeze you. And this guy was so mad. I was a little afraid he was going to get violent. He was really angry. He was quivering and so angry. And in essence, what he said was, I got to recount this so that if anyone knew him, they would know that it was about him. but but in essence what he said was um uh you know you you're not you're not preaching the biblical jesus we don't need all this uh psychotherapy blank blank um what we need is more of the bible we need to go more by the word and we don't need all this memory stuff you just need to forgive and forget i mean it's your decision and when you become a disciple of jesus he says that you have to forgive or he won't forgive you and and so it's your obligation to forgive and he was going on along those lines and I asked him questions about how is that to be done if it's not a real thing, is it just a willpower thing? Well anyways, to make a long story short, I just started asking a couple questions, I was wondering what is fueling this guy because he's really on fire and I asked a couple questions about people he's had to forgive and what came up was he had to forgive his father who had, this guy's face was slightly disfigured. And it was disfigured because his father had beat him so bad that it had broken his jaw and his face was all disfigured. And as he began to tell me this, I began to feel the anger turn to sorrow. It was like, you know, he was talking about what his dad did to him. But then, bam, he pulled right up again. He says, but in Jesus' name, I forgave him. And I just let that be bygone, you know, hey, none of us are perfect parents, and went on and on. And this had, like, denial written all over it. You know, but what was fueling him, the reason why he hated that sermon so much is that it was beginning to get a little close. You know, he was frozen all over the place. But in some ways, it's easier to have a quick-fix solution. It's certainly easier for pastors to have a quick-fix solution, so you don't have to deal with messy people. You know, you just come up, bam, hey, pray more, or fast more, do this more, do this more. It's a lot less messy. but unfortunately it's not at all healthy. Okay, no, no, no. Okay, all I want to say about this is this. Far more fundamental than anything we struggle against in our will or in our flesh is what goes on in our mind. You know, what goes on in your mind determines what goes on in your behavior, determines what your attitudes are. So the Bible places a great deal of stress on, and we'll get to that next week, the centrality of the mind in the Bible. I think if there's any, we've already touched on it a little bit, but if there's any major analogy, or not major analogy, but major discipline, major area where we need to exercise discipline, it's in our mind. And this is, I think, the area where we least do it. Because our behavior and our willing and our effort is much more tangible, much more concrete. And so we can shoot at that real clearly. But what goes on in the mind, no one knows about, no one ever knows about, and so it's very easy just to keep it as being irrelevant. We're very empirically or public, materialistically orientated in our culture. And so we live under the assumption that only what people see, only what's public is really important. So what goes on in the privacy of my mind just doesn't seem that relevant, doesn't seem that important. But as a matter of fact, in one sense it's the only thing that's important because if you reform the behavior and the attitudes and everything else external to you but leave the mind untouched, you haven't done a thing. But the other thing is that you probably won't ever reform the external until you first reform the mind. 1 Timothy 6:12 talks about the battle of faith. The battle of faith. It is the battle to believe in faith that what is true about you is true, over against all the deceitful messages that you've gotten. James 1.8 says that the double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways. To be double-minded, to be torn in two directions. Here's the two directions I gave, and here's me in the middle. The battle between the old self and the new self, what dad said about you, what grandmother said about you, as opposed to what the Bible says about what Christ is about you. The pattern of the world versus God's word. And see, we're constantly influenced by these two. At least we're constantly influenced by the world. Now, whether or not we're constantly influenced by God's word is a different issue. That's our decision. But we're constantly influenced from the other direction. As long as the mind is absorbing that, and that is the content of the mind, it will be certain that what comes out of yourself, what comes out of your life, will be ambiguous. Your behavior and your attitudes, what I mean is that it'll be ambiguous as to the truth that you're in Christ. It'll be partly world, partly Christ. It'll be a mixture of things. There'll be constant conflicts going on. And so we don't grow in our Christ-likeness. This is where the battle, the central battle has to be fought. Now I'm going to show that from Scripture next week. 10, 15 Scriptures that locate the mind as being at least one of the central, if not the central places where the battle between the flesh and the spirit, between Satan and God is fought. It's in our mind. And if ever there's an area that we need to take control of, and if ever there's an area which has more immediate positive benefits, not the long way down the road, but immediate positive benefits, it's in being disciplined about the mind. And so we're going to talk about the discipline of thought control next week. Okay, we need to close. I'll tell you what, it would help if I do this. If you have pencils, write this down. As an assignment for next week, I'm going to give you a couple passages to read. 2 Corinthians 10, 4 and 5. 2 Corinthians 10, 4 and 5. Philippians 4, 7 and 8. Deuteronomy 6, 4 through 9. Deuteronomy 6, 4 through 9. All of them talk about the centrality of thought control. Colossians 3, Colossians chapter 3, verses 2 and 3, and verses 9 and 10. And finally, read Psalms 119. That's for everybody. Read Psalms 119 and look at the role that the Word of God has in David's life and what he does with it. For those who desire to do this, and I don't know if there's anyone who desires to do this, but for those who feel led to do this, I am going to recommend that next week we have a two-day fast, Tuesday and Wednesday. And so if that's something you want to embark on, there will be others of us who will be doing the same thing. And we'll get a report back from you on Wednesday. God bless you guys. See you around. Thank you.
