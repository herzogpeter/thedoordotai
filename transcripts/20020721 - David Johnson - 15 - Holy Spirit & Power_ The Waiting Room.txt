I am delighted to be back, especially on an occasion like this. It feels really good to be all together in one place. If I look older, it's the glasses. I can see you, and I can see this at the same time. You know, when I came home with these glasses a few weeks ago, especially with the string, you know, thing going on, my kids went nuts. and I told them what I you know it's like you're an old man now I'll tell you what I told them the true sign of age is not these glasses and it's not the string it's that I don't care that is it you know dawn on me I go to these stores and you know I have my glasses and I can see out here but I can't read and I've been writing checks by faith. What I mean by that is not faith that there's money in the bank. Some people do that, and it's not a good idea. I know there's money in the bank. It's faith that there's actually a line there that I'm writing on. Now I can see it. I also want to publicly thank and commend Scott and Jan and Keith, who, more than filling the pulpit in my absence, spoke words. Yeah. I was actually able to be here last week to hear Keith, but I heard the tapes of Scott and Jan, and also of Tom, actually, who spoke in my absence before I was gone on the break thing. But those people spoke words that, in my view, kept us in this very important place that God has had us in for over a year. Did you know that? We began this consecration in time of preparation a year ago, June. Consecration and preparation for where it is we're going, both physically and spiritually as well. My break was refreshing, very, very refreshing and restful spiritually. If not physically, I really am learning to be with God in quiet places and hear his voice in new ways. So spiritually, it was quite wonderful, actually. Physically, I did a lot of work. I think a lot of you know that Bonnie and I moved into a townhouse just before we kind of went on the break. We're doing that empty nests, downsize thing. So I spent a good part of my break moving in, getting settled, taking on projects that normally I wouldn't have time for, wouldn't do the biggest project I jumped on, was obviously, without a doubt, the most exhausting. I painted my garage. the inside of my garage. Halfway through I was asking myself what you're probably asking right now who does that? I mean that's nuts. It involved taping and sanding and priming and painting not just the walls but the ceiling not just the ceiling but the floor. He painted his floor. Not just with any old paints but epoxy thing. This epoxy thing it's going to last. Not just a two-car garage, but a three-car garage. And did I tell you, I have a drain. See, some of you don't care, but most of the guys here are going, you have a drain? Wow. That's what made it worth painting, the drain. Yeah, I know, yeah. I like the physical work. I did like doing that, and I wanted to use the physical work to do some spiritual things. I did. I listened to Dallas Willard tapes the whole time, and I prayed while I was doing this thing I don't normally do. Lord, it's kind of just you and me, and we're all alone. This isn't for a sermon this week. It's just for you and me. Just talk to me. I wanted to listen. Well, he did, and I wanted to share with you the word he gave me. He gave me one word three times. It came almost in an audible voice. The word was this, don't quit your day job. so I'm back if your time in my talk it's starting now I think that all of us are aware and can strongly sense that we are in an unprecedented season in our church's life I don't know if you've done the math yet, but seven weeks from this very day, 50 days to be exact, from Monday to Monday actually, we will be moving into our new home in Maple Grove. Now if you keep doing that, it's going to take longer for me to get through this talk, and they're timing me. But I also think that we are also aware and can strongly sense that what God is doing among us, fashioning in us and calling from us, involves something far more significant, deeper and more profound, even more exciting, quite frankly, than simply a physical move to a physical building. How many of you just sense and can't even quite articulate it that God's up to something among us? Some of what he's up to is clear to me. I've seen it, and so have you. Some of it is unclear. I haven't seen it yet. One of the clear things was one of the things that Sid shared with you in the announcements, but it kind of came to us in the form of a word some months ago. We do believe that God gave to us a word as a church in the context of this preparation and consecration that we are to move into Maple Grove as a people of the basin and the towel. We are not to go into Maple Grove with an attitude that we've arrived there to fix them, but we've arrived there to serve them. With this goal in mind, lofty and wonderful, kind of getting misty-eyed when I think about it, that maybe someday the people in that community, even some people who never come to our church, the most maybe cynical pagan, if you will, in Maple Grove, will be really glad we're there. Because we came to serve them. Tom, in the sermon he gave a month or so ago, said it this way, God is moving us, beloved, into that building in Maple Grove in order to move us out of that building into the community. In other words, the building we're moving into isn't where the ministry happens. The ministry that we have in the building is going to be helping you become equipped and ready to move out. The ministry happens where the people are out there. Scott said it this way a few weeks ago, that the building in Maple Grove is not the promised land. And even though we're kind of coming around a date and very excited about it, I think we need to really realize that. That was a word, I think, from God. It's not the promised land. The promised land, this is kind of a paraphrase of Scott, the promised land is the authentic working of the kingdom of God, transforming day by day your life and mine, and then bringing that kingdom life, that kind of kingdom life, into the community, making it visible and available to people who just maybe need some life, some real life, not religion, not your right answers, but they need life because everything else in their life is dead or dying. All of what stirs in me an awareness that to really live that way and see those lofty things come to fruit among us as a body, we need much more than good sermons, much more than great music, wonderful plans, capable people. We need much, much more than a new building in Maple Grove. We need power. we need kingdom power we need Holy Spirit power the kind of power that can take acts of simple obedience that are kind of this big in terms of how much you did and multiply that simple act of obedience multiply the healing and life giving effect beyond what you could ask or think we've already had glimpses of this kind of taste of things to come. Again, this is what Sid talked about in the announcements, looking for a practical way to kind of take a baby step toward this goal of entering Maple Grove as servants so that maybe one day people would just be glad we're there even if they never come to our church. We invited a number of you to sign up as volunteers for the Maple Grove days. That's no big deal. That's not a big deal. How many of you got hurt really bad? It really was hard to do. It wasn't a big deal. we felt especially led you may remember that to not only volunteer but to volunteer for the jobs that nobody else wanted the hardest ones to fill which meant that a lot of us ended up picking up garbage that's what I did and I liked it especially when I was looking for garbage over by the classic car show just well seriously I was I was looking I was bending over looking in the interior of a 1969 GTO, and I heard a voice behind me, what are you doing? Yeah, it was my wife. And I said, I'm looking for garbage, and this one's clean. This is good. Let's go check that 72 Chevelle. I just want to make sure there's no garbage there. You know the rest of the story. About 200 of you or so signed up for that, and the response of the organizers, you heard the announcements. We don't know what we would have done without Open Door's involvement. We're so glad you're here. Here's what I want you to let in about that. We've been praying about that. Do you know that some people are already glad we're there and we're not even there? See, that's exceeding the... That's an exponential thing. And I'm telling you, that is nothing. That's nothing. Compared to what I believe God is calling us to. It's a tiny, tiny, tiny example. One designed to encourage us before we even get there of how a simple obedience in the hand of God can be multiplied beyond what you can ask or think. That's power. Now all of that is why several months ago we began to talk about power in this series on money, sex, and power. It's why today as we round the bend, I kind of do see this day as we're gathered together in one place as a rounding of the bend and coming to the home stretch. But I want to begin to talk about the Holy Spirit and power for kind of the rest of the time until we get to our sites. Now, several weeks ago, I mentioned this to the message team that in the flow of our dealings with power, at some point I want to talk about the Holy Spirit and power and probably do it at the end of the time and culminates. The first response of the message team was just a sense of rightness about that. It sounds like a good flow, a good way to wrap it up, culminating in the consecration service at Earl Brown. And by the way, we're very excited and I hope you're all marking the calendar September 8th is our first service in the new building. But I don't tell you, as excited I am about that first service, that last service at Maple Grove, or Earl Brown, rather, we're going to consecrate our power to God. I get mushy just thinking about what that service is going to be like. But as we thought about this whole thing of dealing with the power of the Spirit some more, As we found ourselves considering some obvious scriptures that deal with the Holy Spirit and power, what I call a weird wondering began to emerge in our message team. The weird wondering kind of came like this. We wonder if God wants us to enter a kind of upper room waiting around this thing of Holy Spirit and power. And my question when I first heard that is what your question is. What's an upper room waiting thing? Well, in Acts chapter 1, verse 4, which is one of the pertinent scriptures around the coming of the Spirit for power, Jesus is speaking to his disciples about the coming promise of the Father. The promise of the Father was the coming of the Holy Spirit, particularly for power. Not just on a few, but on everyone who named the name of Jesus. But what I want you to do first, Jesus said to the disciples, was a very important thing that hardly anybody talks about. I want you first to wait, chapter 1, verse 4. Don't leave Jerusalem. Don't blow any trumpets. Don't take out an ad in the paper for your special meetings. Just wait. For 40 days, Jesus had presented himself alive to them with many convincing proofs. For 10 days, they would be in the upper room. You have 50 days of waiting. And one of the things the message team noticed, isn't this weird? It's just weird. 50 days from this day till that day, we will go to Maple Grove. I know it sounds a little weird. it sounded weird to us but we decided together that on this day at Northrop whatever it was we said in terms of sermon what we wanted to do was invite you corporately and individually into the waiting room with God for 50 days call it another one of those strange obedience things see I think words from God often start with weird wonderings you know what I mean It's like, I don't know if some things that stir in me or other people are weird wonderings or a word, and I think you need to sit at them a while and share them with people and get some wisdom. And often those weird wonderings do become a word, and then you enter into what I call strange obedience. Strange obedience. You know about that. When they came to Jericho, they wanted to pull out their swords and do it that way, and Jesus said, I want you to do a weird thing. I want you to march around this thing. Keep your swords in your sheath. And then blow a trumpet. The consecration services that we're doing came out of weird wonderings and then strange obedience. A few months ago when we had a communion service, it was a strange obedience that said, Dave, don't talk. We talk very short, just enough to explain that what we're going to do today is invoke the name of God, invite the presence of God. So we're inviting you by way of strange obedience. We're not exactly sure what even this means into this waiting room. A word about waiting. I don't do it well. I don't feel weird Terribly weird anyway Sharing that with you I have a feeling There's a few of you here Who don't wait well I hate waiting for stoplights In fact I have devised ways Of timing stoplights So that I can make all the green It's actually about conservation for me I think you should just save the brakes I don't use brakes I just do the accelerator thing I think meters on freeway entrance ramps Are evil Amen I think waiting for a table at a restaurant For more than 20 minutes is obscene I don't care how good your food is Wines in grocery stores are the worst And variably I get in the line of a cashier Who has ruthlessly eliminated hurry from their lives I'm not a good waiter All of that creates a very significant problem for me. You know what it is? It's this. Waiting is a very important discipline in the spiritual formation of God's people. You see, the Bible says a lot about waiting and its value in our formation. See, it's those who wait upon the Lord who have their strength renewed. Beloved, if you never learn to wait, I hate waiting. If you never learn to wait, to stand in line, to just wait when nothing's happening, if you never learn to wait, you'll never learn to listen. If you never learn to be quiet, you'll soon run out of strength. It's those who wait who keep on running. Now, I poke fun at my inability to wait, and it's true. Waiting does not come naturally for me. I do want to tell you that I am learning some things about waiting. For instance, I am learning that if I'm going to keep up with the ever-increasing pace, even of what's going on in our church and what God is doing in our church, one of the things I need to learn and you need to learn, I need to learn to slow down. This is an incredible paradox. I just can't do it unless I learn to slow down. I'm learning that as things around me and even around the ministry and what God is about to do among us, and is doing, gets louder and louder. You know what I'm learning I need to do? I need to learn to get quieter and quieter. And as things get bigger and bigger, and I don't think I need to tell you, I think all of us have a sense that things are going to get bigger and bigger. And I don't even mean the number of people who attend our church, but I think it's just going to get beyond that, bigger and bigger. What I'm learning is I need to get smaller and smaller and smaller. So wait. just learn to wait God's word to me about waiting is this he says this to me everyone you can do it Dave you can do it and the word to you is this if Dave can do it anybody can do this another word about waiting I don't think waiting necessarily means you know one of the questions is we're going to do this waiting room what are we supposed to do I don't think it means that were necessarily doing nothing, you know, for the next seven weeks. There were some things that marked their waiting in the text. If you look at Acts chapter 1 and 2, the first thing that I noticed was this. They did their waiting together. Acts chapter 1, verse 14, they were all together in one accord. I don't want to make a big thing of that, but I do want to notice that it is significant to me that on the Sunday that God, by His Spirit, prompted us to invite our whole body into this kind of waiting room with the Spirit. it just strikes me interesting noticing that we're all together in one place. Of one accord? Well, the truth is I don't know the heart of every person in our church. But in ways I have rarely sensed in 20 years here at Opendoor, I would say yes, of one accord. Second thing that the text reveals they did while they waited was they devoted themselves to prayer. Again, that's in chapter 1, verse 14. Now, I don't know how you picture their prayer meeting, but it probably was significantly different than a lot of prayer meetings you've ever been in. You see, my guess is that there was at least as much listening going on as there was talking. I mean, I grew up going to prayer meetings, and basically the prayer meetings were about people standing up and giving long, long speeches, and there'd be a man do that, and a man do that, and a woman would do that, and I'd be sitting there in a prayer meeting wondering what kind of speech I could make, and that was prayer meeting, and bored just me to almost death. Listening to everybody's speeches. I am quite positive that if they were devoting themselves to prayer because of what I'm learning more and more about prayer, that there were prolonged periods of silence among them. And in an explainable way, some would begin maybe to weep. Because God would begin to speak to them. I am absolutely convinced that in this 10 days and 50 days of waiting and praying and wondering what was going to happen and not knowing for sure that there came upon them a spirit of confession and repentance. Well, how do you know that? It's not in the text. Well, it is in the text because it said they prayed. And it doesn't mean they kept on talking and talking and then they listened. And I know what happens to me when I be quiet and listen. The Spirit of God confirms to me how much He loves me. but he also begins to cause rise up in me what he needs to deal with the sin in my life I'm absolutely positive I mean I can see it like a movie in that upper room of waiting and praying I mean just see the disciples Peter, James and John just looking at each other maybe with tears welling up and saying to them you know I guess you guys when Jesus was here before all this happened I was so full of myself I didn't even see it who's the greatest we all want to know that and I just want you to know but I don't know what's going to happen many days from now he talked about power is going to come but really in my heart it's his kingdom I want not mine and I think they repented I think they confessed I wondered also if as they waited for what was promising to be a big thing they didn't know what it was going to be I mean I don't think many days from now we're going to all speak in tongues and no I don't have any idea what it was going to look like but while they were waiting for what they knew was going to be a big thing I just wouldn't be surprised if they didn't reflect a bit on their faith story as a people and maybe together just reminisce and think of the word of God and how God had moved among the people of God over time and maybe even remember a time when the people of God stood on the threshold of a really big thing, just like they were on the threshold of a really big thing. Like when the people of God stood on the shores of the Jordan about to enter Canaan, not knowing for sure what was really going to be on the other side of the river, just knowing it was going to be a very big thing. And I wonder if as they sat there waiting and praying, they remembered that the people of Israel on the shores of the Jordan River had to do what they were doing now. You know what that was? They had to wait. And prepare themselves and consecrate themselves for the crossing. Prepare themselves and consecrate for the falling of the Spirit for power. And I wonder if in this waiting and remembering, any of them just kind of spoke up, you know, I know that whole story of the crossing and they crossed and they consecrated. I wonder if any of them spoke of Achan. Remember Achan? Scott spoke of him a few weeks ago in his sermon. Achan, who wanted to be part of the excitement as the kingdom of God advanced through Canaan, really liked that, but he wanted a piece of Canaan too. Achan, who sang with everybody else, I surrender all, but he didn't. And the result of his disobedience at that particular time was 36 Israelites, people in the community of faith, lost their lives and had a horrible impact on the whole body. And he lost his life as well. I have a theory as I just think about that this is just my theory that there are times when you can get away with what Achan did but let me tell you when it's a really dangerous time to to be a pretender it's really a dangerous time to be a pretender when God is moving with power remember Ananias and Sapphira now I'm fast forwarding it, now Pentecost has come, what the disciples were waiting for in the upper room. Happened, the spirit fell, and incredible things were happening. Ananias and Sapphira came one day and pretended to give more than they gave, pretended to care more than they did. And they fell dead. Remember that? Ah, that's incredible. Let me ask you a question. If everybody who ever lied to the spirit died, well, I won't ask you a question, I'll just make a statement. If everybody who ever lied to the Holy Spirit died, churches would be much smaller than they are. I don't think everybody who lies from the spirit dies. Who pretends they're more committed than they are, gives more than they do. I don't think they all die. I don't think everybody who ever did what Achan did dies. But I do believe that when God is moving in power and having his way and pouring out his grace, the stakes go way, way up. This is a hard word. This is a preparatory. This is a waiting room word. If you really don't want to be serious about it, this might be a good time to leave. See, I think one of the things that happens in the waiting room, and this is just my conjecture on this, and I think might have happened among disciples, the waiting room is a time that you get to decide, is this what I really want? I mean, the church is cool and I like music and it's kind of funny and a lot of energy. But we're talking a little more serious than that now. Do I really want this level of obedience? Am I really willing to pay this kind of price? To live this kind of life where we're really serious about God being the possessor of our money. And our power. And our sexuality. Beloved, the waiting room is the place where we get to say yes to God. And you can say no too, but I picture those disciples ten days in prayer, and I think what they said with tears in their eyes, not knowing even what they were saying yes to, I'm going to say yes to you. I'm saying yes to what I cannot see and what I don't even know. I'm saying yes to the waiting room is the time to say yes to God. and to learn to pray this way, thy kingdom come. Thy will be done because it's your kingdom, not mine. It's your power, not mine. It's your glory, not mine. I need to get smaller so you can get better. I believe they did that in that upper room when they were waiting. Random thoughts. It wasn't just the disciples, the 12 who were in the upper room. There were women there. Some say around 120. There was a group of people there. How many of you know their names? You don't know any of them. You know Peter, James, John. James got killed pretty quick. By the middle of Acts, Peter was pretty much out of the scene. You know who's the prominent guy at the end of the whole deal? Of Acts? Of Acts? Paul. He wasn't even in the room. 120 prayed this. It's your name. It's your name. If they never know our name. It's your name. It's your kingdom. It's your power. Guess what happened? His name. His kingdom. His power. Turned the world upside down. The waiting room is where you learn to pray like that. The fact is, I don't know all of what it means For us to be in this waiting room for 50 days I don't know all of what we're supposed to do for the next 50 days Or even what's going to happen I don't know What's going to happen in 50 days Any more than the disciples knew what was going to happen when the Spirit They didn't know what was going to happen But I'm pretty sure we're supposed to pray. I'm pretty sure we're supposed to listen. I'm pretty sure we're supposed to be together. I'm pretty sure we're supposed to be ready to repent. Things that, you know, God's, I'm just going to share this. God's dealing with me with some things, maybe with you, something that I used to get away with, and he's saying, not anymore, David. It's not even sin. Just not anymore. put that away time for us to bring some things that we've been hiding in the tent because it just isn't worth it right now it's a time to be eager to do good and I'm pretty sure it's a time that we need to be quiet in fact this quiet thing is how I want us to enter the room and we're going to enter it that way right now I'm going to ask Bruce to come and the worship team to come and even as they come just right now as we kind of together enter this waiting room with the spirit of God ask the people of God just take some moments and be quiet Thank you. Remember this. The king is not saved by a mighty army. A warrior is not delivered by great strength. A horse is a false hope for victory. nor does it deliver anyone by its great strength. Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear and love him, on those who hope for his loving kindness to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine. Our soul waits for the Lord. He is our help and He is our shield. For our heart rejoices in Him because we trust in His holy name. Let Thy loving kindness, O Lord, be upon us according as we have hoped in Thee, according to the measure of our hope in You. Let Your loving kindness be upon us while we wait. Thank you.
