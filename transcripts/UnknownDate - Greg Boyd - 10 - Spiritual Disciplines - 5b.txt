It doesn't happen overnight usually, though it can. But you're gradually chipping away at the old self. You're affirming what is true about you, what the promise of God's word is about you, over and against what the old self says about you. Hide the word of God in your heart. Do what David says. Meditate on it. He says he meditated on it all day long. A lot of things you can do while you're meditating. I mean, again, you can't be a computer programmer or an air traffic controller and be sitting there, what was that verse again? Oops! There are certain things that you've got to have attention. But there are a lot of things you can do. You'd be amazed at how much free time you have. Driving the car, eating, a tremendous amount of free time. Usually, the whole of our minds is not required for what we do. Having a normal conversation, you can be tacitly saying these things as you're talking. It can become an awareness. In fact, the goal of this is to make a truth of Scripture part of your general awareness, part of just your general viewing of the world. Okay, so Scripture memorization. The general is good. The specific, I found, is what works best. Another way is to take a scriptural principle affirmation, and this is very similar. This isn't about memorizing a Scripture, though. It's about taking a principle in the Bible and taking a verse in the Bible and extracting from it a principle that applies to you. It's still the truth of God's Word. It maybe isn't the exact wording of God's Word, but it's the truth of God's Word. This is what I do most often. This is what I find works most often. Because now I can put things in a wording that applies most poignantly to my life or in a wording that is easy for me to remember. Take a truth. The other thing is that when you're in a situation when you need it, you don't have to worry about are you getting the verse right or something like that. It's just a principle that's there. And that's what we want anyways is the truth of the word to be residing in our heart. So take an issue. Take a struggle. Your life's a project, right? And you see every day as a project. So take the area that you want to work on now. Maybe you're having a lot of trouble loving someone. A person in your life is very difficult. You really have trouble loving them. You don't understand how they think. You guys rub each other the wrong way. Your old self says, you waste people like that. Your junior high experience, everything you learn from junior high comes to the tip of your tongue when this person is criticizing you. And you know you could rip him to shreds. And you'd love to do that. So you do it. No. I'm going from my own experience here. OK, the old self says, hey, get ready, man. Waste this guy in front of everybody. tear them apart. You survived junior high. You can do this. But what is true about me in Christ? What is true about me in Christ? And here is the occasion when you start saying the truth that we are in Jesus Christ. In Christ, I'm filled with a love for all people. The love of Jesus Christ dwells in me richly. The love of Jesus Christ dwells in me richly. In Christ, I love so-and-so. In Christ, I see beyond the surface and see the wounds of his heart. In Christ, I'm moved with compassion towards this person. Begin to say that. What I find works real well is this. To have a time where this is a real live issue for you. In prayer, you see yourself as you are in Christ. See yourself loving this person. Kind of rehearse it. You think about it. We do that anyways, but this is becoming intentional about it now. We usually rehearse the wrong things. Usually what would be going through my mind is about how I would have liked to just kick this guy in the rear. And that will play through my mind all night long. And so I get in the morning and wonder why I have such a hard time not kicking that guy in the rear. Well, I've been thinking about it for five days. It's seared into my consciousness. It's a part of who I am, how I experience myself right now. How can I help but do it? But if, instead of that, what I rehearse is what's true about me in Christ. That I, the Holy Spirit, God Almighty dwells within me. Think about it. God Almighty, the creator of heaven and earth, dwells within me. that's a pretty big reservoir of power it's a pretty big reservoir of love and love is one of the fruit of the spirit and in Christ I'm redeemed I'm regenerate I don't need to go through the surface sort of reactionary defensive junior high holistic juvenile mode in Christ I'm moved with love I like to know if some of you have experienced this but I've had occasions where it's good to do this before the occasion arises but when the occasion arises I've had it where I begin to say what's true about me in Christ. And sometimes to my amazement, I begin to experience it. It's like all of a sudden, whoa, I did this, but I didn't think it would work. And here it is. I feel a love towards a person that really hates my guts. I feel a love towards them. Or I'm in a situation where I should be going crazy. I'm in an anxious situation. But in Christ, I'm filled with infinite peace. My life is rooted in Christ where there is peace. And bam, there's peace, there's tranquility. And it almost surprises you. Most of our growth comes gradual, slow. You'll notice it over time. Keep a journal so you can see your progress. But sometimes with this stuff, it clicks, it latches. What happens is that you confront a stronghold, and you can tell when the stronghold is torn down. You're bringing every thought captive under Christ. And bam, a stronghold just left. I feel at peace. I don't believe it. I feel the peace. I should be going crazy now. I'm going to lose my house. I declared bankruptcy. I don't know what's going to happen. But I've got a peace about me. And that's why the Bible says it's a peace that passes all understanding. Because I can't understand it. It comes from some source other than myself. Take it seriously. Now, where discipline is required is this. I'm not going to ask you whether you did it. No one's going to ask you whether you're doing it. No one's going to ever know whether you're doing it. Only you will know whether you're doing it. And it takes discipline to do something that no one in the world ever is going to find out about. But it's very, very good to do. And actually, in the long run, those who know you well will see it. Will see it. It's something different about you. Being transformed by the renewing of my mind. Okay, image control. I talked a little bit about this. We don't just think with words. We think with pictures. It's how the mind operates. It's how the thing is networked. And a lot of times what is operating in our mind, though again we're not normally conscious of this, but there's a picture that we have in us that is a stronghold over us. There was a guy that I knew that had this phobia. He was afraid of driving, just really afraid of driving. Well, it turned out that he had been in a rather serious car wreck several years before, pulled out in front of a car, and ever since then he's been afraid of being in a car. When you talk to him a little bit, get him to slow down and ask, and begin to analyze his fear. Actually, a therapist did this before I had done it, so it was really easy for me to do it and he kind of helped me to do it. But you break it down into snapshots. What are you thinking when you get in the car? What goes through your mind? What is gripping you when you have this feeling of fear? There is a split second flash of that accident and every time he drives, it's like a subliminal technique. It's in his mind, it's in his psyche, and so he's got the same fear, quite irrational fear, of getting hit broadside whenever he's driving. It's an association thing. The image has to be confronted. Well, in times of rest especially, I find this to be very effective, is to confront the negative picture. First of all, examine the pictures you've got about yourself. When you feel inferior, what are you thinking? or when you feel, when you give in to that sin, what is really going through your mind? Analyze it. Begin to pay attention to what operates in your mind and begin to observe it like a movie screen. Become a specialist at what you think. It's the most important thing about you. And yet normally we just sort of ignore it. See the kind of pictures that go through your head. And then combat those pictures with pictures of who you are in Jesus Christ. And this is all simply how do you think about yourself. Bring every thought captive under Jesus Christ. He says, bring every imagination captive unto Jesus Christ. How do you image yourself? And in prayer, in times of resting with the Lord, see yourself like that. Can you see yourself? Pick out the most ungodly area of your life. In fact, let's do this right now. Think of a thing. This is an experiment. Think of a thing. Close your eyes and think of what is the most ungodly aspect of your life. Okay? What is the most ungodly aspect of your life? I have no idea what it could be. But where are you worst? If it's hard to choose among them, choose one of them. Now, pick out one. Get a particular instance of, get a picture of yourself. Get a particular instance of what you do when you do that. See yourself doing it. Maybe it makes you cringe when you see yourself doing it. Now, try to see, and the Holy Spirit help us in this, can you see yourself being freed from that? How would you operate? How would you respond? How would you feel? What would it be like for you to be totally free from that? To be Christ-like, to have Christ character in this situation. Can you see it? If you can't see it, you'll never become a reality. Ask the Holy Spirit to see it. Try to see it vividly. Try to see it in color. Try to see it in color. Try to see it very large. Try to feel the joy that you'd have, the freedom that you'd have. Okay, that was simply a little experiment just to kind of show you how it operates. The one picture is operating in your mind anyways. Before you get mad and you pick up your Bible and you swear and you throw it at the person, at the person. You know what? There's a little screen that says, this is an appropriate response. You're the kind of person that picks up Bibles and swears and throws things at people. Your behavior only follows from what goes on in your mind. So if you want to change the behavior, it won't do any good to just be shamed and thinking, oh, you should never throw the Bible, because then you just throw the music stand. Or even if you just keep a bottle up, you're not any better for it. Maybe you learned how to not throw things. And that's a good thing to do. Don't throw things. But you haven't been transformed. You're still the same person, feel the same things, the same ungodliness. Be transformed by the renewing of your mind. It also works with others. It also works with others. You know, they've done studies about spouses. What makes, what keeps a relationship alive in a marriage? Why do some marriages work and other marriages not work? And one of the things they found, there's a number of variables, one of the central things they found is that in marriages that are happy, in marriages that are solid, and in marriages that are work, where they have this index of happiness, whatever. Those who rank high think about their spouses in a different manner than those who rank low. They think about their spouses more and in a different way than those who have unhappy marriages. It's like this. If you have a person in your mind and something happened where you began to not like them and you begin to chew on this, I'm sure you've experienced this if you think about it. you chew on it, you go over and over in your mind, you rehearse what they did to you or what they said to you over and over again, what happens? They begin to get darker and darker. You develop an animosity towards them. Your hatred begins to grow. Maybe it starts off as a little thing, but three days later when you meet them, you're ready to blow up. You're ready to kill them. Because of the way you thought about them. And now there's an appropriate response to that. That's an extreme example of what goes on all the time. How we think about people determines a lot of what we feel towards them, how we act towards them. This is a good thing to do. Take, in your time of prayer, ask the Lord to help you get a picture of a person you're having trouble loving or being compassionate towards or what have you. And begin to see them in a different light. Maybe commit yourself to trying to see them that way several times a day. I know that when I think about my wife throughout the day, just make a note. Oh, I wonder what she's doing right now. I picture her at her office doing her work. Or I picture my kids. It works with kids, too. When I come home, I'm in a much more loving mood. I'm in a much more compassion. I'm much more sensitive to their needs. I'm there for them. Whereas it's not like the reality starts when I walk in the door. How you think about people makes a big difference. Sometimes if you have a person that you really don't like, ask the Lord to give you a picture of how he sees them. All right? And try to picture them as he sees them. And what you might find is that what you were angry at was a lot of surface stuff, and behind there there's a deep wound that needs compassion. And you can be moved to that. The final thing about mind control is praying without ceasing. And that's really along the same lines as this. The Bible says, pray without ceasing. In church history, the main way that this was practiced, it wasn't the only way by any means, but one of the main ways that this was practiced was by something called the Jesus Prayer. And what Christians, it's been very popular throughout church history, began I think in the 7th century, really became popular in the 15th century, and there's tremendous experiences that are told about this. It started with the Hesychist movement. But the Jesus Prayer was simply this prayer, Jesus, have mercy on me, a sinner. Jesus, have mercy on me, a sinner. I could think of a better prayer, I think, but that's one that they always used. Jesus, have mercy on me, a sinner. And their goal was, this was their goal, to get that to be such a part of your thinking that it becomes the backdrop against which everything else you think. It is the presupposition of everything else that goes on in your mind. So that even when you're talking, you're hearing, Jesus, be merciful to me, a sinner. Whatever you're doing when you're doing dishes, when you're hoeing the garden, Whatever you're doing, except if you're an air traffic controller, but whatever you're doing, there's this prayer, Jesus be merciful to me, a sinner. It's good to take a prayer like, you are the reason for my being. It's a prayer. Anytime we talk to God, it's a prayer. You're the reason for my being. And begin to integrate that into your entire day, maybe your entire life, whatever, however long you want to go with it. To make that part of your mind control. You're the reason for my being. And then to say, I have perfect peace because my eyes are fixed on you. My life is hidden you, and therefore I'm filled with your love, and I'm filled with your joy. You are the reason for my being. What kind of person would result if we filled our day with those kind of thoughts? Think about it. Think about what we think about throughout the day. What kind of person would we be if we, like David, meditate on that day and night? If that was a project. Maybe we should limit our project to not our lives, but to our minds, to be transformed by our minds. OK, any questions or feedback on this? Yes. That's a really good question. Yeah, I don't want this to at all be heard like to see something unreal, to pretend like they're better than they are, or to be an exercise in denial. I mean, that was one of the main problems with positive confession is that they take a truth, and it leads to living in denial. And so you deny that you're sick. You deny that there's problems. You deny that you're poor. You deny that you need glasses. Well, here it could be, I just choose to see them in a good light, and therefore I'm not going to confront their problems. That's not accurate. This isn't a way to get away from truth. It's a way to realize truth. So it's good to picture them in a good light, try to see what God sees, ask God to reveal to you things about them so that you can see yourself loving them, get out of the gridlock that we sometimes get in where we really have negative views of other people. So I can't relate to you. Whenever I think about you, I think about your nagging. Or whenever I think about you, I think about what you did to me last year. Well, it's good for me to get an accurate picture of you to see beyond that event. And that's what this is about. But that doesn't at all entail not being open and honest with real things that are going on. There's no sense of pretend here. That's the difference between biblical meditation and pop psychology. Pop psychology, in essence, is let's pretend that we're a certain way and maybe we'll actually become that. This is, let's discover what's real and true. Because it's already true, so we can manifest it. We're not trying to become it, we're trying to manifest it. Yeah. See, it's like, you know, the thing that comes closest to me is marriage. Probably because I'm married, but, you know, We, believe it or not, have once in a while, like twice last year I suppose, disagreement or issues that need to be confronted. And I need to confront those. And if I don't confront those, it probably has something to do with the way I see myself or there's something else going on that I need to work on. But seeing my wife in a good light to keep the love kindled is not unrealistic at all. It's a very realistic thing. One of the things they found in those marriages is that the people with the bad marriages tend to focus on the negative. The people with the good marriages tend to focus on the positive. But by focusing on the positive, that doesn't mean ignoring the negative. Rather, that's what gave them the energy and the creativity to positively work through the problems. Sorry for spitting on you. So it is the way to do reality, not the way to avoid it. OK, yeah. But it becomes a big deal. It becomes a legend in your own mind, is what happens. And maybe you've had it happen to you. This happened to me five, six years ago, my first year at Bethel. Something I said, and I don't know, it was a minor thing, and I don't even remember saying it, but something I said just somehow got-- it pushed a button. But the student didn't confront me on it, but chewed on it, and chewed on it, and chewed on it. It came back to me six months later. Now this person then started talking to some friends about it. And that helped the story to grow, too. By the time they came back to me, you would not have believed how this turned into a class confrontation where their imagination has gone crazy. But that's why confronting things at the time, don't let the sun go down in your anger, is so important because that's what happens. As we chew on things, it gets deeper and deeper. The stronghold gets deeper and deeper. That's why Paul says, right when he says, don't let the sun go down in your anger, the next verse he says, don't give the devil a foothold. Because letting the sun go down your ankle is what gives the devil a foothold, a stronghold, and it gets deeper and deeper and deeper. And it gets more intense and more intense. And far from you think you're discovering what's really true about this person. Now I see what they're really like. You're not. It's just distorted. And then we start using words like this. You always do this. No one always does anything. But that's how it gets in our mind. You never do this. I never. And it just gets blown up. Yeah. that's excellent I hope you all heard that that's a good testimony get a person you hate and begin to pray for them no really that really changes your view towards them the other thing is that if they really have animosity towards you if you just say I've been praying for you man it's not guaranteed to work they may say yeah right But that's a real sign of love, and that could begin to tear down some of the walls there. Yeah. How you think, so you are. You know, it's not like this. The mind is simply a very, very complex muscle. The brain is part of our body. It's no different than a bicep. It's just a lot more complex. We are to be lords of our bodies, to be in control of our bodies. and part of our body is our mind it's not the public part of our body but it's part of our body it's a muscle and through the spirit of God we can take ownership of it that's why Paul can tell us bring every thought captive unto Jesus Christ he assumes that we have the power to do that we are owners we are more than our brain we are spirit as well as mind and in the spirit we can take control of these things and that's what if you get the mind you got the rest of the body everything else follows from that It's just a complex muscle. That's why some secular psychology really works. It's for the same reason that secular physiology works. You're dealing with an objective datum here. If they can find out how it works, how it's wired, you know. For example, we now know that to some extent depression is caused by a deficiency of a certain enzyme, which connects the cells together. Among people that are clinically depressed many times, there's a deficiency of this enzyme. enzyme, so you take, what is it, Prozac or something, and you're out of the depression. That's just, that's because the mind's part of the body. It operates with a lot of the same physical laws as the rest of our body does. So all we're doing is taking what the Bible says is true about us and saying, okay, let's get a hold of it. Let's go with it. As much as we work out with our bodies, if we work out with our bodies, we should work out more with our minds. Okay, do you have something to say? Sure. The question is, how does this relate to forgiving? And the caution I would have is that forgiving can be used too quickly. Yes, it works for forgiving, but there are other things that have to, I think, usually work before that. And before you do anything, you think about it. And before you forgive, you think about it. And so in this, if in Christ, your life's from Christ, your life's not from the person that offended you, and you're getting that down, you can see yourself being full of Christ, you're bringing your mind in line, every thought captive unto Jesus Christ, one aspect of that then will be you can let this person go. Because having unforgiveness is one way of just hanging on to their stronghold over you. They're wounding you. And we think we're empowered when we don't forgive, but as a matter of fact, they're the ones who are empowered when we don't forgive. And part of the freedom of Christ is to be able to let them go. They weren't a source of life to start with, so however they disappointed us, however, whatever they did can be released. And so, yeah, I would say in prayer, ask the Lord what it would look like for you to forgive the person, to release the person. And what it may look like is, first of all, Grieving. And then, second of all, being angered. But the goal will always be forgiveness. Okay, I want to run through one final thing. And I'd only plan this taking 10 minutes anyways. I want to talk about breaking nasty habits. Usually when people think about discipline, this is what they think of. This is the first thing that comes to mind. Actually, this is a real small footnote. In fact, I think that if you get this, you're going to get this. Okay, the same principles apply, but we can be more specific. What are some nasty habits we have? By shouting them out doesn't mean that you have them. It just means, you know, I just want to, let's get a catalog of some of them. Murder. Yeah, I can't quit. I try to kick that habit of murdering, and I just can't. Smoking cigarettes. Well, I never heard that one before. Okay, smoking. That was a joke. Usually that's the first one that comes. Smoking. Any other nasty habits? Gossiping is a habit. It can be a veritable addiction. That's a good one. Because that's even listed in the Bible. Smoking is not. But gossip is. Really, gossipers. It's right in Paul's sin list. And that is a veritable addiction. I don't know if you've ever known anyone who's been addicted to it. Or maybe you've been addicted to it. Whenever there's silence, you feel the need to talk about someone else. It's an addiction. It's like lighting up. Isn't that stupid what she did over there? Same thing. Yeah. Lust. Sucks. Overeating is an addiction. Television can be an addiction. Absolutely, that's great. A complete vegetation mode. No different than drinking, tookscape, get absorbed in television. There are people, I mean, have you ever met anyone who's really to do this? I've known people who would revolve their whole vacation schedule around movies. What was that and stuff? And wherever they went, one lady didn't go and visit her son on Tennessee because he didn't have cable, and there was a movie coming out on cable that she had to watch, and it caused major problems. It's a true addiction. Yeah. Procrastination. That's one It really is. Tomorrow I'm going to really get on that. Okay, that's good. I think busyness can be a hazard. Okay, work. Work addiction. People are going to be absorbed in that. Got to get a buzz. Sports addiction. I was hoping a man would come out with that one. No, I've never known a woman addicted to sports, but I have known a lot of men, a lot of husbands with wives upset about it. They revolve their lives around sports. It makes or breaks them. Shopping! I was hoping a man would say that one. Shopping! It's like, oh, there's a card I saw just recently. What do you do when your life's meaningless? Life is meaningless. or what is the purpose of life? It's meaningless, it's empty, it's void, it's futile. What is the purpose of life? And then you open the card and it says, okay, shopping, but then what? That's kind of cute. Anyways, shopping, credit card use. Credit cards are of the devil. Everyone knows that. Okay, we got a repertoire of nasty habits here. The only purpose of doing that was to break it out of the smoking mold. I don't want to just be talking about smoking. I don't know how that became such a... We didn't even mention drinking or drugs. The thing about nasty habits is that we need to know that willpower is usually not enough. Not if you're talking about a real ingrained habit. Sometimes willpower, sheer willpower will do it. But that depends on a lot of variables. Like, for example, my father used to drink about a quart of whiskey a night and smoked. He was a smoking fiend. tried a number of times to quit, especially smoking. Drinking, he never really tried to quit. But it took a-- and it never worked. But it took a humiliating experience where he had to speak in front of this tire unit. He was the head of a tire unit. And he used to have this terrible morning cough. It was just the most grotesque. He used to yank him up terrible. And he started doing this. The talk was in the morning. And he had such a coughing spell-- coughing spit-- that he couldn't give the speech. And it was so humiliating that that finally motivated his will. It depends on a lot of variables. Or with drinking. He couldn't quit drinking until I went to the doctor one day. And it turns out he had a bleeding esophagus. And the doctor says, either you quit drinking or you're dead in six months to a year. He also got the willpower. So willpower sometimes is enough, depending on other kind of variables. But usually, if you just decide that since it's not acceptable to do this, usually it's not enough. We need to understand that all behavior serves a purpose. Everything we do serves some purpose or other. We are intentional beings. Unless it's a twitch of some sort. But all behavior serves a purpose. Even a twitch usually tells us that we're angry about something. Okay, there you go. I'll take that. What's the purpose of that? Okay. With regard to habits, the purpose usually is something to do with pleasure. and often combined with the fact that the purpose confirms something about the person's self. What do you think is it supposed to be? With pleasure. You know how it is. That nicotine drag, there's nothing quite like it. Nothing will replace it. There's a feeling of at least normalcy that you get when you take the drag and you haven't had a smoke for five hours. And finally you're normal again and it feels so good. It's an immediate sensation. There's some pleasure getting out of it. Sexual addiction, there's pleasure associated with it. We focus in on one pleasure, and it becomes kind of a source of life for us. Also, the behavior usually is spun out because as you think in your heart, so are you. You're conformed to the pattern of this world. You have a view of yourself. With regard to smoking, there's a sense of self there that says that And there may be, anyways, a sense of self there that says that my body doesn't deserve more than this. At least there's not a sense of health that I deserve to be free from this. Other kinds of self-destructive behavior are a similar kind of way. As you think in your heart, so are you, and that brings forth kind of the addiction. At the very least, with regard to all habits that we have, there is a conversation that we hold that tells us that this is who we are. I just can't control myself when I go into the shopping store. I am bored stiff when I don't watch TV at night. I'm the kind of person who can say no to alcohol. I really need that buzz. There's something inside of us is leading us to the behavior. All other things being equal, we won't be free from the nasty habits until we confront the pleasure principle and confront the self-image that's driving us. We need to replace the pleasure with something more pleasurable and confront the untruth of the self-image that's leading us into it, assuming that's a nasty habit. A lot of habits are really good. Like reading your Bible. Wouldn't it be great to be addicted to that? Or worshiping God or talking to yourself truth about God's word. What a wonderful addiction. But if it's damaging and we want to change it, we need to confront what's behind it. All behavior is intentional. And so before you can change the behavior, you've got to find out what the intention is. What purpose is it serving? It's serving some purpose here. Even self-destructive behavior, it's serving usually to confirm to the person how destructible they are, how stupid they are, how worthless they are. And you can tell a person, you shouldn't be pulling your hair out of your head. There's a disease that sometimes people, not a disease, but kind of a habit that people get. They pull hair out of their head and they scratch themselves sometimes. It's serving some kind of a purpose, and you can't just say, don't do that, you shouldn't do that. It's bad. Don't you know how bad that is for your health? You really shouldn't be doing that. Naughty, naughty, naughty. Why do you have to watch so much TV? Why do you always spend so much time shopping? You need to confront what's behind the behavior. You need to confront what the Bible confronts, and that's our mind. Okay, in four minutes, let's just go. How do you change this? Realizing that you're not dealing with a surface thing, but you're dealing with an internal thing, A soul thing is the first part of it. So you don't accept, what usually happens is we accept surface solutions. We have a surface analysis of problems, and so we accept surface solutions to problems. The problem is with the behavior. She sass back to me, that's the problem. And so I accept a surface solution to the problem. I slap her if she sasses back to me. Have I solved the problem? No. The problem is, why did she sass back to me? What's going on here in this relationship such that my little kid would sass back to me? The problem is never, in and of itself, the behavior. It's what's behind it. And that's true with ourselves. Okay, first of all, rest in Christ. All the things we talked about last week. Here is where God does his soul work here, where he begins to make the self whole, begins to tell you who you are, you begin to experience who you are in Christ. You can only begin to confront behavior when you're big enough on the inside to confront the behavior. Let Christ love you as you are in the midst of your behavior, in the midst of the habit. We interrupt this, our normal programming, for an important news message. Dear people listening to the tape, the tape ran out, and therefore you didn't get the last three points of Dr. Boyd's four-point summary of how to break free from addiction. Actually, this is Greg Boyd, So now for you people who are listening on the tape, I will conclude this section here that wasn't recorded during the class session. The first point was to rest in Christ. You only have as much strength to confront an addiction as you have internal reliance on Christ. As the self gets bigger, you're more empowered to confront the addiction that you're a part of. Resting in Christ as you are in the midst of the addiction, being loved for free in the midst of the addiction, is what will empower you to eventually break free from the addiction. The second point is this. We need to see the damage, the destructive nature of the habit that we're a part of. The deception of nasty habits is that we really believe that they're pleasurable. We really believe at a fundamental level that we need it, that it's good for us. And that won't change until our perception of it changes. Ask the Lord to show you the consequences of this, the damage of it, to show you the ugliness of it. When I was 19 and I had for two years been struggling in my Christian walk with pornography, I couldn't break free of that just by my own willpower. But there was a time when the Lord really revealed to me the true nature of that sin. He showed me his love and his grace and loved me as I was, and that began to make the soul bigger. But that gave me a clarity of perception to see how damaging this sin was in my life. And he literally gave me a picture of that where I saw people involved in pornography as just swimming in manure. and to see the filth of it and see how destructive it was. He showed me how cheap people are valuing their bodies and how far it is from the beauty that God created people to be. And the extent to which you can see the ugliness of the sin that you're a part of, it loses its pull on you, its appeal to you. Ask the Lord to show you the social ramifications of maybe the addiction that you're a part of, how it harms maybe your family relationships, how it harms you. how it harms society. The third point is to see yourself free from the habit. See yourself as you are in Christ. And to see that with as much clarity as possible. We need to replace the pleasure principle, right? And so the way we do that is by, number one, seeing the addiction as being non-pleasurable, seeing it as God sees it, but then replacing it with something more pleasurable. And what that is, is what your life would be like free from this habit. Get a picture of what your life would be free from this and hold it in your mind. And maybe in times of devotion, meditate on it. Write it out. What benefits would your life acquire if you were to be totally free from this? And the degree to which you can see that clearly, you see, that motivates you to aspire towards that. That motivates you to work towards that. It will involve suffering. I mean, breaking free from addiction always involves suffering. It involves a certain amount of pain, but the pain will be worth it if you see the goodness, the goal, the beauty of what you're aspiring towards. If the you that is free from this addiction becomes stronger than the momentary pleasure you get from the addiction, you're motivated to break out of it. The fourth thing I'd say is this. Simply practice thought control that what we've been talking about. Letting your mind be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Take the biblical truth that pertains to your addiction and make it a part of your mind that in Christ you are free. Paul says, I will be in bondage to nothing. In Christ you are a slave to nothing. Let love rule in your heart, not some addiction rule in your heart. The love of Christ motivates you and gives you strength and that you're willing in Christ to suffer for righteousness' sake. Make that a part of your everyday thinking, your moment-by-moment thinking. Reinforce the truth of who you are in Christ over and against the lies that are keeping you involved in the addiction that you're a part of. The final thing that I'd like to say about this breaking free from addiction is this. The more decisive the break, the easier it is to break from it. James again says that the double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. the degree to which you are single-minded in your intentionality to break free from this addiction. The greater that is, the easier it will be. What really makes it hard is when we enter into a conversation with our addictions, when you begin to negotiate with it. Some of you may know this from experience. You try to quit smoking, and that cigarette pack in the store starts talking to you. It talks to you. says, oh, just once, you deserve it, you've earned it, you've gone three weeks now without that, you know, wouldn't just one cigarette, you know, taste so good, or whatever the addiction may be, and it talks to you. And if you start negotiating, if you get in that game, it's going to be much harder for you to abstain from that than if you make a complete break and just refuse to talk about it, refuse to negotiate with it. It's actually easier. The more you're intentional about making a complete break with it, the easier it will become.
