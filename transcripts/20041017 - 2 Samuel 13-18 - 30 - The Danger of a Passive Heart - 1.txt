Pray as we go to the Word. Lord, I thank you for the working of your Spirit already among us. Already on the weekend, the ways your Spirit has stirred things and called things out and cut things off that needed to be cut off. Thank you again for the power of your Spirit at work in the worship and ways in which, in ways that we don't even understand. we sense things, we don't always know how to put words to them, but things that have already been accomplished by your Spirit in our hearts. Things that have been accomplished by your Spirit that allows us, in again, ways we maybe don't understand, to now receive the Word. Father, I pray for the power of your Spirit to now deliver the Word. We live in the information age, Lord. We talk, we have, the last thing we need now is more information. I pray for revelation, the kind that penetrates the hearts of men and women and calls them to light and to life. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. In what we have been calling for over a year now, a journey of the hearts, we began last week to examine what I referred to as a rebellious heart, a father-hungry heart embodied in the story of David and Absalom, a story of rebellion and father hunger, if there ever was one, If you were with us last week, I'm sure you remember we began this whole thing by examining, first of all, Absalom's rebellion. In 2 Samuel chapter 15, how he used to rise up early, it says in verse 1, and stand beside the way to the gates of Jerusalem. With open arms and slippery words, he sympathized with anyone who would come by the gate on their way to see King David. with some sort of grievance. He would intercept them and tell, instead of bringing them to the king as they should go, he intercepted them and he sympathized with them. He understood and said this in verse 3, your claims are right and good. You've been mistreated, but no one will listen to you. You shouldn't even bother to go to the king. He doesn't care about you. Oh, but if I were king, said Absalom, things would be different. There would be justice. That was verses 1 through 4. of 1 Samuel 15. Now, even to a casual observer, it's pretty obvious what Absalom is doing here. He is using people's discontent to draw them to himself. He is, in a word, usurping by means of manipulation. The manipulation was seen in the fact that he did what he did behind the scenes at the gate with the pretense of concern. He wasn't direct, and he did all that for the purpose of control. The key to the whole thing is control. If I were king, he wanted to be king. In other words, he wanted control. I called it a spirit of control last week, a spirit of division, a usurping spirit. And I was careful to point out, and I want you to kind of get into the flow of it again today, I am not talking about an attitude. I'm talking about a spirit here, a principality and a power that seeks to control, that seeks to usurp God-ordained authority, that finds its full expression and embodiment in Satan himself, who is above all a usurper. He is indeed the usurper. So when you see this kind of thing at work, someone who in a family or in a church or in some context of work even. When you see someone doing this deal, someone who is usurping by means of manipulation, they aren't direct. It's behind the scenes. It's at the gate. It's with the pretense of concern for the purpose of control. Don't wonder what you have. Don't wonder what you're looking at. Don't wonder what you're dealing with. It is a demonically empowered dynamic, and it happens every day. You know, we talk about spirits and principalities and powers. We see those things happening in the heavenly realms, and some of us are, well, yeah, we really know what's happening here. We need to know that these kind of dynamics, this usurping by means of manipulation for the purpose of control, happens every day in families, happens every day in churches, in our church, in governments, in workplaces, in kingdoms of every kind. And it was happening here in 2 Samuel chapter 15. For by these means of manipulation, for the purpose of control, Absalom stole the hearts of the people. It's said in verse 6. So that David and all those loyal to David fled Jerusalem. We see that in verse 14. And then in chapter 16 of 2 Samuel, verse 15, Absalom and all those who were loyal to him entered Jerusalem where he began to rule. But it's an illegitimate rule. having usurped the God-ordained authority. But in terms of how things look right now, the rebellion is successful. But it wasn't ultimately successful. It never is. In chapter 18, verse 7, it says that the people of Israel who made alliance with Absalom were defeated. And Absalom wound up hanging by his hair from a tree with three spears in his heart. Picture that. Hanging by his hair from a tree. Three pictures, three spears in his heart. It's a very pretty picture, isn't it? I'm a very visual person, so it's not hard. You know, it's a weird thing. We encourage our kids to, I don't know if you know this, we encourage our kids to in church, write a picture of what you see. And I come, you know, kids write crosses and people praising and, anyway. We get pictures of guys hanging in front of their hair from a tree, anyways. That picture of Absalom in that condition, hanging from a tree by his hair with three spears in his heart, is a symbol, I believe, of God's judgment on. It's a symbol, I believe, of God's attitude toward this spirit of division, this Lucifer spirit embodied in Absalom, which functions to usurp by means of manipulation for the purpose of control. And the reason I want you to see it that way is because we don't always get to see God's judgment that clearly. Because many times in the living of our lives, we happen to be living our lives in the part of the story where it looks like the usurper is winning. I mean, if you were in the story, if you were living in this day when Absalom came and drove David out of the city, you would be with David going out of the city saying, all is lost. And it looks like the usurper has won. And the family's been destroyed and the church has been divided. But every once in a while, you get a glimpse of where this usurping spirit is going to wind up. And here it is, right here. It is hanging by his hair from a tree, three spears in his heart. Now, it was at this point in the telling of the story last week, after we looked real closely at Absalom's rebellion and the end of it, that it all looked very clear to us who the good guy was, who the bad guy was, just the way we like it, black and white, cut and dried. David was obviously the good guy. Absalom was obviously the bad guy, the demonized guy. David was clearly the victim who had been usurped. Absalom was clearly the perpetrator who was the usurper. Until we raise two questions that we return to now today. Question number one, where was David in all of this? When Absalom's rebellion was growing and then when his rebellion manifested itself, where was David in all of this activity? Number two, question number two, what does any of this stuff have to do with the father hunger that I said the message was about? Well, it turns out that where David was in all of this was passive. Remember that? Where David was in all of this was silent, uninvolved, disengaged, inaccessible, thereby creating in Absalom his son, the father hunger we've been talking about. It was David's disengagement, inaccessibility, and passiveness in his relationship with his son that created the father hunger. The father hunger we referred to last week as creating a vacuum in his soul, and into that vacuum demons had rushed. Demons of self-doubt, fear, mistrust, cynicism, and rage, which does not mean Absalom was not responsible for his rebellion or the damage that it did. Absalom is responsible for his rebellion and the damage it created. But David had a piece in this, and it's very important that we see that. We began to look at it last week. It's why this week I want to look in more detail at what I will call today the danger of a passive heart. The danger of a passive heart. Indeed, I want to identify, expose, and speak against as best I can the danger of a passive spirit. I'm not just talking about an attitude. I'm not talking about a kind of a personality trait. I am talking about a passive spirit. Absalom was operating with what we called last week a usurping spirit. David is functioning with what I am calling this week a passive spirit, not an attitude. I'm talking about a principality. I am talking about a power. And I want us to see the danger of that, not only in the context of father and son, because that's the context within which this story is being told to us between Absalom and David, but I want us to see the danger of this passive spirit in the context of husband and wife, of families, of how we minister to and love our children. I want us to see the danger of a passive spirit in the context of a church, in the context of government, of a workplace, of a kingdom of any kind. Here's why I want to explain how dangerous this is. Let me explain it this way. In the flow of the story, where we are in the story this week is this. Absalom is dead. So let's just kind of be there in the story. I want you to kind of in your mind see him. See him there in the trees hanging by his hair from a tree. The rebellion is over. The crisis is past. Order is resolved. And so if we're actually living in the story, right now what is appropriate for us to feel is relief. So everybody take a sigh of relief. Everybody deep breath. Doesn't feel good. Absalom's dead. The rebellion's over. Quiet. Peace is going to come back to church to the open door. Aren't you happy? The kingdom is restored and the division is over and Absalom is dead and I feel bad for him. I'm sad I had to die. But let's take a break. Let's start singing and dancing again. Or some pizza. Absalom is dead. But we still have some work to do. You see, if something doesn't happen, to identify, expose, confront, and then change the environment or the soil within which Absalom grew, within which this usurping spirit was able to take root and then to grow and then to do what it does, if something doesn't change in the environment that created that, Absalom, though dead, will rise again. And we will find ourselves dealing with a usurping spirit in our families, in our church, in our communities. We will find ourselves dealing with that over and over and over again and not know why. Here's why. You've never done anything about the environment within which Absalom was allowed to be born, the spirit of Absalom was allowed to be born and allowed to grow and then allowed to do what it does. And the environment is an environment of passivity. by the way this connection of passivity to a usurping spirit is seen so clearly in absalom and david is seen in other places of scripture as well and that's always an important thing to note when you see messages or symbols that are consistent through scripture and you see them in other places it just gives them strength and speaks to us about their importance what one of the other places where we see this connection of passivity to a usurping spirit is in the relationship between a king called Ahab and a queen called Jezebel. The story is found in 1 Kings 19. This king and queen, Ahab and Jezebel, were enemies of the people of God, and Jezebel was a kind of feminine manifestation of Absalom, who sought to usurp by means of manipulation for the purpose of, guess what? Control. Now, the manipulation that Jezebel was involved in, if any of you know the story and kind of the typology that is around Jezebel, is her manipulation was of a sexual nature. So in other words, she would use sexuality to kind of get her way and bring people into her thing. But even though some vile sexuality happened around Jezebel, and always does around the spirit, the purpose and the real end of it has nothing to do with sex. It's all about what? Control. So you have the very same thing here, something desiring to usurp by means of manipulation for the purpose of control. But none of what happened, none of what Jezebel was able to do could have been done without Ahab, who like David was, guess what? Passive. Now David's passivity toward Absalom created a wound in Absalom, and in that wound created by David's passivity, there came rebellion. Ahab's passivity toward Jezebel did not create a wound. It created permission for her usurping to just continually express itself unchecked. He just wouldn't stand. He wouldn't take authority. He wouldn't say, no. And by the way, I'm not talking about taking authority like I'm the boss and you're not the boss. I'm not talking about that kind of authority. Just when you see someone doing something wrong, the authority that says, stop. He was passive. By the way, one of the reasons that passivity is hard to confront and even hard to spot, and sometimes the damage of it is done before we notice that that's the problem, passivity, is because passivity, to look at it, doesn't look mean. It doesn't look bad. Passivity doesn't have a club in his hand walking around hitting people on the head. That's not passive. Passivity just sits there like a lump doing nothing. I mean, it's the last guy you look at. It's the last woman you look at as being the problem because you're sitting there going, I don't know. I didn't do anything. Yeah, I know you didn't do anything. That's the problem. All of which is why I want to talk about the danger of a passive heart, the danger of a passive spirit, and the damage it can do in a family, in a marriage, in a church, in our church, in a government, in a workplace, in a kingdom of any kind. Now, to do that, I want to kind of quickly remind you of David's passivity and the part it played in Absalom's rebellion. There were three incidents that kind of illustrate this passivity and how it connects to Absalom. The first was when Amnon, the firstborn son of David, raped his half-sister Tamar, David's daughter by another wife. Tamar, having been raped by her half-brother, looking for a place of safety, went to the house of her brother Absalom, where both of them waited. And what they waited for was their father to do what fathers do when daughters are devastated. There was Tamar waiting. Dad, Dad, I need someone to defend me. I need someone to protect me. I need someone to fight for me. I need to see someone who will make right what is wrong, who will bring justice. And Absalom was waiting for the same thing. Here is this young man desiring to be a great warrior. It was in his blood. It coursed through his veins. He wanted to defend his sister, but he's looking to his dad. Dad, show me what authentic masculine strength looks like when justice needs to be brought. Show me how to make what is wrong right. And show me how to do it in a balanced, healthy, just way. because I don't know because I'm ready to kill somebody to tell the truth. So there is Absalom and there are Tamar waiting for David to do what a father does when a daughter is destroyed, when a daughter is devastated. And when David in chapter 13, verse 21, heard that Tamar was raped, he became very angry. So he's got some energy, and it's a really good sign, but he did what? Nothing. For two full years. Remember that, the text? For two full years, David did nothing. He was silent. He was passive, uninvolved, disengaged, till one day Absalom decided to mete out justice himself. But he did it like a loose cannon. He did it like a warrior who had no king. Remember the typology out of that last week? Talked about the fact that young men and young women rise up and identify most with this archetype of a warrior. They just got energy. They got juice. They want to accomplish things. And they got this I can, I will spirit. And it's really good. And it's wonderful. But warriors, just by virtue of their age and who they are, lack the breadth of a king. Warriors are good, but they lack the breadth of a king. So what a good warrior needs to do if he's got any or she's got any wisdom at all is this. Find, be in relationship to, and then become submissive to a great king. You know why? Because a warrior without a king is a loose cannon. Absalom wanted, Dad, show me how to do this. Show me how to exert justice and authentic strength in a right way. But he didn't have a king. His dad, his king, was passive, uninvolved. And therefore, Absalom just is going to use all his energy, and he is a loose cannon. He is a warrior without a king, so he murders Amna. And then he flees. Verse 34, and when he fled, left Jerusalem, and now he's in exile, It says in verse 37 that David mourned for Absalom every single day, and he longed to go out to be with him. Oh, I want to be by my kid. I'd love to God and find him and love him and bring him home. Three words, but he, what? Didn't. Which is the second manifestation of David's passivity. All of it creating this environment of rage in Absalom. and usurping in Absalom for three full years this time. Verse 38, David did nothing. Get that. He did nothing. He said nothing. He felt stuff. He felt what? Anger when Amnon raped Tamar. He felt mournful when Absalom went in exile, and he longed to be with him, but he did nothing. People go to church like that every single week. We feel things. We sing, God will save. Oh, I feel it. I feel it. And God calls us to obedience. We go, I feel it. And we get a tear in our eye and we do what? Nothing. In a lot of ways, David was doing with Absalom what he did with Amnon. Nothing. Sure, he got angry with Amnon, but he didn't do anything. And he felt bad about Absalom and sad, but he did nothing. Till chapter 14 of 2 Samuel, where through a parable delivered by a wise woman from Tekoa, in verse 2, David was persuaded to bring Absalom home to Jerusalem. So that looks good. There's going to be a reconciliation. And as they're coming, David gave this stipulation, verse 24. Then the king said, only let Absalom go to his own house and let him not see the face of the king. So Absalom turned to his own house and did not see the face of the king, did not have interaction with his father for two more years. Verse 28, which is the third example of David's passivity, silence, inaccessibility, which raises the question I left you with last week and we are entering now again in a more focused way. The question is this, why? How? How could this man, David, who we have seen and been with for over a year in our study of the journey of the heart and come to know as a mighty warrior and a good king, how could a person like this be rendered so absolutely impotent here? And that is exactly what he is, impotent. how why well here's my theory I don't know for sure I'm right but I think I am but actually it's quite obvious and I think you're going to be in agreement with me there might be other reasons but this may be the most primary it's this I think that because of his own sin with Bathsheba his adultery there and with her husband Uriah the fact that he manipulated things so he would be murdered because of that He had lost what I would call moral authority in his own home and had not yet done the work to take it back. And here's the thing that might be a flash for some of us. Take it back, you must. See, some of us have in fact entered into forgiveness for sin in a variety of ways, but we have never taken back something, never even known we were supposed to take something back that we lost when we fell into sin, and that is a sense of moral authority so we can call others, particularly the next generation, our children, into the life of the kingdom of God. I kind of see it this way. I feature somebody who, you know, they're 40 years old now, and they have teenagers in the house, and they kind of think back on their former life, and when they were in college, they did drugs, and they slept around, and, you know, they remember the damage that did in their spirit and in their soul and the work they had to do. And now that they're 40 years, 45 years old, they really have entered into forgiveness around all that. They feel healed about that. They're not walking around full of shame. They're forgiven. They're cleansed. They've repented. But now their kids are going to college. And now they're starting to hear that their kids are dinking around with drugs and they're sleeping around. And everything in them knows the damage of that. And then there's this hesitation. There's this hesitation to go and move into their life and say, son, daughter, I love you like crazy, but I got a big no for you. That sense of moral, they're forgiven. It's not about, I don't feel, no, they're forgiven. But they've lost moral authority, and they have never taken it back. And I'm here to tell you, you need to take it back. This is obviously a very big thing. I said it in the first service as if this was like a great revelation that this dynamic is some new thing. But this inability for parents to have moral authority in their own homes and say no to their kids, it's frightening. It's almost like parents are afraid of their kids. I love this. A friend of mine and I were talking about this the other day, and I would put this in the context of parents, fathers in particular, who have special feelings for their daughters. I don't know if you know this. They do. And we get a little protective around our daughters. Now, feature having a daughter, maybe 15, 14, 15 years old, and one day some 15-year-old kid appears at the door. I'm here to take out your daughter. Well, there's something that rises up in me. I don't know about you, but there's something that rises up in me. Now, we live in a culture. Feature how twisted this is. I'm kind of a car guy. You know that. And I've got kind of a cool car in my garage. Here's what I feature, and this is what's going on in our culture, I think. I feed you going to the door, and there's a 15-year-old kid there, and he says, I'd like to go out with your daughter. And here's what I say. And he goes, oh, by the way, I like your car. And I go, I pull out my keys, and I go, hey, take my car for a spin. How many of you think I'd do that? And here's what I know about the kid. He doesn't love God, doesn't care about God. He's got a rebellious spirit. I heard he sleeps with every girl he goes out with. But I will say, no, you aren't touching my car, but take my daughter for a spin. How twisted is that? Is it time to stand up and take moral authority and realize we can say, no, what are we afraid of? I think we're talking about a spirit. Had David confessed his sin with Bathsheba and Uriah? Yes. Had he repented? Yes. Was he forgiven? Yes. But I suspect that he was not living in that forgiveness as his ultimate truth, as being what was most true about him. Now, that might sound odd to some of you to think in terms of what is most true. What do you mean by that? Well, I want you to think in those terms for just a few moments with me, if you can. And to understand that there are things that are in fact true, but also things that are more true. Let me explain that. You are a sinner. Every single one of you. That's true. you know what's more true? I hope you have it rising up in your spirit right now when I asked the question, you know what's more true? If you are in Christ, here's what's more true. You have been washed in the blood. You have been redeemed of your sin. In him, you have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of your sins according to the riches of his grace. Here's another true thing about you. You have wounds. You've been hurt. You feel weak, maybe really weak this morning. That is all true. You know what's more true? You are the righteousness of God in Christ. You can do all things through Christ who gives you strength. And in Christ, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in a bodily form, and in him you have been made complete. That's more true. But until we seize that, until we become the kind of people that seize that and actively take hold of that, we will remain passive, practicing the presence, not of God, but practicing the presence of our sin, practicing the presence of our wound, I'm wounded, practicing the presence of our failure and our fear. And this just adds another spin to the damage that sin does. We spoke at length about this when we were doing David and Bathsheba and the consequences for sin because among the things that sin does is that it gives the accuser of your soul something to accuse you with that's true. See, when he comes to you and says in your little mind right now, you really screwed up last week. It's true. So David, Amnon just raped your daughter. What are you going to do? What was his first instinct? He became angry, which means what? He's going to react. He's reacting to this. Something's rising in him that tells him what to do. You've got to bring justice. You've got to make right what was wrong. But then a voice comes. It says, who do you think you are, David? How on earth do you have any right, any authority to confront Amnon? You're really no different than him. Sure, you didn't technically rape Bathsheba. But really, what choice did she have? You're the king. Kings get what they want. They say, I want her. They get her. And they take what they want, and you took what you wanted, just like Amnon. You're no different. Sure, you're forgiven, David. And if it makes you feel good to know you're forgiven, feel good about that. But if you act as if you actually are forgiven and begin to live in a free way and actually take authority back, you know what the truth is, David, it's going to look like you really didn't take your sin very seriously in the beginning. Because if you walk around kind of standing up straight, looking people in the eye, they're going to think, hey, you must know. The real thing that was, you know, if you really want to show the people, especially the religious people, that you're repentant and you're sorry and you're remorseful and you're really humble, you should just really walk around like, oh, yeah, thank you for letting me come. I don't deserve to be here, but just could I sit back in the back? Then we'll know, oh, there's a holy man back there. He looks like a wimp. and by the way this would help to constantly remind yourself of what is true here's the truth here's what's true you're a sinner you really blew it you've been wounded remember that remember that you have hurts don't forget that don't forget it and you're weak you're just weak sure you're forgiven go ahead and feel good about that but you have no authority you have no authority so sit down, shut up, do nothing, and stay what? Passive. Here's the truth. You are, I am, a sinner. We have blown it. We have been wounded. We are hurt. But here's what's more true. You are and I am the righteousness of God in Christ. You are and I am a priest of the Most High God, free from condemnation, washed in the blood of the Lamb, more than a conqueror, one through whom Christ can do all things. And until we seize that, take hold of that, we will remain passive. And I'm here to tell you that this passivity is not an attitude. It's not just a problem. It's a spirit. It is a principality. It is a power that needs to be identified, exposed, repented of, and removed from our families, from our churches, from this church, from governments, from workplaces, and kingdoms of every kind. But identifying this spirit is not often easy because this spirit often disguises itself, sometimes as humility, sometimes as remorse. I'm really nothing. I really have nothing to give. I'm just weak and wounded, but thanks be to God who gives us the victory. again again I mean we do it's weird how we get these impressions of what spirituality looks like and sometimes it just looks like hello demons of darkness don't be afraid of me they're not honestly I think this is maybe stretching but I think this spirit in a body, it affects the body. You'll see people walking around. This is the spirit of passivity. Let me only keep giving you things to try to expose this thing. A passive spirit will press you to live under the shadow of your past. You think that's holy to do that? It's not. A passive spirit will press you to live under the shadow of your past and convince you that it is spiritual to do that, That it's humble, that it's right, and that your past is the final answer. Again, sure you're forgiven, but don't be stepping into anything thinking that God could use you to love your kids or call out your sons and daughters or love your wife or love your... No, no, you're forgiven. That's it. So go ahead and feel forgiven, but don't do anything. Here's the deal. If you are living under the shadow of your past, you are living under the shadow of a lie. I came forward for prayer last week. I love this story. One of our prayer team guys told me about this. He came and he was affected by the sermon. He just identified with David. And he realized that he had left some things for his sons and daughters that weren't good. And he really identified with David. He was good. Oh, Absalom, my son, my son. And the worship team guy prayed for him and just blessed him and said, oh, man, you just need some healing for your heart. But then this came out of the conversation. And what he was really in despair about, what he was really in despair about is that my sons are now older now and they're kind of out of college and it's too late. It's too late. And here's the deal. If you believe that, you will remain what? Passive. Have you done some damage? Yes. Is your heart wounded? Yes. Would you like to reconnect in some way with your sons? Then rise up, O man of God, and go love your son. Don't reject me. Do it anyway. You might have to start with some small steps. Don't be busting into their life if you've abused them. You might start moving. Stand up straight. But if we are living under the shadow of our past, we are living under the shadow of a lie and it makes us passive. And then Satan just can, okay, it's okay, enemy, just do what you want with my kids. Stop it. This authority needs to be seized. The passive spirit, let me give you another little insight on this spirit. It is a self-absorbed spirit. It's all about my wound. It's all about my hurt. It's all about my sin. I am weak. I am worn. I am weary. I am needy. You put that to the music, it's somebody's favorite worship song. I am weak, I am worn. We do have worship songs that sound like that. We do. I mean, not all of them. You know, Joel and I have been talking about this in the worship team. We've been talking about this and wondering, wondering. How many songs? How many songs? God, I believe, by the way, God is calling our worship to a new level. He is calling the word to a new level because he is calling us to a new level of kingdom life and authority in this community for our children to call them out into life. But how many of our songs? We just begin to reflect and wonder. And you know what? I don't know if it's after today, but we're going to begin to notice, I think, from time to time, when we're even declaring things that put us in a place and sing songs that reflect more of a preoccupation with ourselves than a preoccupation with God who saves the day. I remember hearing a song. I don't know if I was on the radio or whatever, but I was becoming more sensitive to this, this preoccupation with self-absorption with me and my wound. And I was hearing a song, and the song said, Rescue Me. And the rest of the song might have been great, but it said, rescue me. And immediately I get this picture of a turtle on its back going, ah, rescue me, rescue me. Okay, please God. And I think some of us even get mad at God. I think we get mad at God because we come from prayer or we're kind of gumming with God and we know there's a bitterness in us and there's a sadness in us and there's something in us that we're not able to love. And we keep waiting for God. Okay, God, just make me nice and make me better. And he didn't make me better. one of the things we've been teaching for years here is that the way the spirit of God works is in cooperation with us when we get up off our back and say God I am going to obey you and this doesn't feel good but I'm still going to do this and God in his power releases things on that and you begin so start and move and stand up straight I feel wounded I know you do and we're going to give you a hug while you start moving and while you start serving and start obeying now Passive spirit says, oh, you can't do that Just wait till you feel better, then go You'll never go Passive spirit, another little piece for you Is incapable of looking up and seeing more That's the body posture I think the body posture captures something It's like this You need to look up I think this is best illustrated in Numbers chapter 13 The people of God were being called by God Into the land of promise They already were the people of God, but God was saying, I have a richness of life for you that you can't even imagine. But you're going to have to cross the Jordan, and you're going to have to believe me and step into this life, what we call now life in the kingdom of God. Not just I'm going to heaven when I die, but the fullness of the life. And so in Numbers, you remember the story, they sent out 12 spies. And spies came back. All but two came back with this report. There are giants in the land. And guess what? That was true. And then they said this. There are giants in the land, and they're so big. Here's the truth. We are like grasshoppers in their sight. And somebody here, you know, somebody talked like that around here, and we would, you know, say, how are you doing? I'm doing great, but I'm kind of like a grasshopper in my own sight. I'm just a grasshopper. And we'd go, how humble. I'm a grasshopper. I'm just being real. That's our value. We're real. I'm a grasshopper. And they're giants. Joshua and Caleb came back and saw the giants I think this is very important they weren't in denial they weren't in a conspiracy with each other as they were going back to the camp hey don't tell them about the giants they weren't doing that they saw the giants they came back they said there's giants there they're huge they're scary they're fierce but they saw what? more a passive spirit is incapable of looking up and seeing more. Joshua and Caleb said the giants are true. There's something more true. We have a God who is bigger than those giants. Amen. But the result of those other spies' passivity is that the people of God wandered in the wilderness for 40 years, never entered into the land. Were they God's people? Yes. Were they going to heaven when they died? Yes. But they missed a life. I don't want to miss a life, and neither do you. James chapter 1 speaks of people who are passive toward the Word of God. He calls them hearers who never what? Do. They go to church, they nod their heads, they take their notes, but they never act, they never do anything, and therefore they never change. and they wonder why. Here's why. They're passive. Final thing on this, just quick. This passive spirit has a root of fear. Has a root of fear. In fact, it may be something you're feeling right now. Because what I'm doing, I am confronting a spirit this morning. And as I do it, you could, I wouldn't be surprised if you even have kind of an anxiety in you right now. Fear, as it relates tandemly to passivity, is designed to keep you passive. Don't go there. Don't go there. See my buddy Keith over here, and I think of all the times God has called us to move into things that were difficult or confront something that was wrong, and every single time there is a need to rise up with a holy ability to make a confrontation and speak some truth. We hear a whisper. You hear a whisper. It says, don't go there. Don't go there. Don't do it. And fear rises up. don't go, don't go there, don't say that. I tell you, how many of you think I felt any fear in preparing this sermon? Don't go there. You don't even want to know. Beloved, I say all of that to now say this. I believe that the spirit of passivity is here among us. I believe that it has been allowed to take root in a number of ways, by a number of means. Some of them even good. Coming kind of in with some dimensions of our message and our life together that are very good. I mentioned a minute ago, our primary value as a church is to be real. And man, be real. Mourn. Blessed are those who mourn. Blessed are the broken. Blessed are those who mourn. And so the real thing is, I'm just here. I'm just so wounded. But we're calling you. And that is going to continue to be our number one value. But we need to not only just be sitting in our wound, we need to see more than that and rise up into our healing. I mean, by the way, if it troubles you that yucky things can come in on good things, I had a friend who gave me an illustration. He says, Johnson, even when a baby is born, you've got to cut some stuff off of that thing. It's real sloppy and messy. You've got to clean that thing up. There's a bunch of junk that comes with that you get rid of. You don't throw out the baby, though. Okay. We're cutting some stuff off today. Okay? It is, I believe, my assigned task to stand this morning in the authority that I have and to first of all speak against this spirit as I have done this morning, to identify it as best I can, to expose it, repent of it, renounce it, and remove it, and to ask you to join me in doing that very thing. In fact, I want you to stand right now as we wrap this up. And as I preach this message and I talk about wanting to expose, repent, renounce and remove this thing from among us, those of you who have a yes in you toward that, I want you to leave your seat and come down right now. From the balcony, we'll give you time. Just come down and down. We want it out of our families. We want it out of our churches. We want it out of our church. thanks I'm going to do what I asked in the first service too if there are any elders, people in leadership I want you on the stage with me, thank you Joel is here there's something going on between the word and the worship that is important for this thing as well keep coming, as you come I'm going to talk and then we're going to pray, I want to just give some just a word, I want you to know that what we're about to do, what we are about to do is a power encounter. When I begin to pray, and it's already been happening in the Word, but two kingdoms are colliding here. You need to know that, the power of darkness and the power of light. And they are going to collide. And whether we see that collision or not, or hear that collision or not, there is a power encounter happening, and God's going to win it. But whatever it is that God does here is going to be in many ways complete, but there are ways in which we're going to have to walk this out in faith. There are going to be ways in which the spirit of passivity we see here will now be seen more clearly. I think one of the things I want you to notice that in your family, in your marriage, in your dealing with your children, you're going to see this thing more clearly and you're going to have to continue to deal with that as you walk this thing out. And that means we've got to do this together. We've got to be together. You can't do this alone. That calls for community. And finding men and women of faith that we can share this thing with as we walk this out. But I just want to pray. And as I pray, I'm going to ask those of you who pray to pray. And then pray in the Spirit. Pray in the Spirit. Holy Spirit, come. We know you're here, so I'm not asking you to start doing something you haven't been doing. but we pray for manifested presence and manifested power. You see these people gathered here, and in there physically moving to the front, they are saying, yes, this is what we want. We want this thing severed. We want to be released. We want to live a different way relative to this spirit. And so, Jesus, we come to you as best we can, and we repent, and we confess, and we repent of a spirit of passivity. We repent. We repent of the ways that we have given into fear. We repent of the ways that we have remained seated when you were calling us to stand up, when we have not moved, when you've been calling us to walk, when we have remained silent, when you were calling us to speak. And all of this moving was never to hurt any. It was to save people. It was to help people. It was to protect our children and to call the life of God out in them. Father, we repent for practicing the presence of our wound. We repent for practicing the presence of our sin rather than practicing the presence of your Holy Spirit that cleanses our sin and heals our wound. We thank you for the ways, we repent of the ways that we have given into this fear that's all over passivity. But Father, beyond this repentance that is so important and so vital. I now invoke the name of God, the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit to now, by Holy Spirit power, sever, to right now sever the cord that has connected us in any way to this spirit of passivity. I pray in Jesus' name that from this day forward there would literally be a change in the culture of our church, in the air that we breathe, that the temperature in the room is changing. In Jesus' name, we pray that you would cast from us every aspect of passivity's influence upon us, that that spirit would be cast off, cast out. And now, Holy Spirit, as those things, as that thing leaves us, fill us now with your spirit. Fill us with the spirit of power and love and discipline and a sound mind so we would know how to love each other well and stand up straight in the fullness of who we are in Christ. Father, you're calling out kings. And Father, that's not just men. That's men and women who are moving into the wisdom of God and are able to turn to the next generation, to our sons and daughters, not even our biological sons and daughters, but to the next generation, and to call them out with wisdom and strength. And we thank you for the warriors among us. Father, Father, we just pray your anointing. I pray for the kings to rise. I pray for the warriors, the young men and women to rise. Do this work among us. In Jesus' name. In Jesus' name, amen. I'm going to do what I've done in the last two services, just for a moment. Some of you have things kind of welling up in you. It's a word from God, something that would confirm this thing that I just want to invite you to speak it. If anything's in you, just a word that would come from you that would just kind of underline this whole thing. Anybody have anything at all? Just say it out loud. Walk through. Joyous trust. I didn't hear it. Amen. Not victims, but victorious. rise up amen amen say it again take back my kids amen that's a word for some of you some of you know that is a word for some of you take back my kids some of you God is telling you I don't even know what that means but some of you know exactly what that means somebody knows exactly what that means you do it keep going I've given you a spirit of fear but of love, power and a sound mind think back what is stolen amen stand again amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen sees the power of Christ. Let me just wrap this up with one word, and then Joel is going to lead us in a song to just say amen to this whole thing. I said it just a moment ago, but God is raising up kings among us, men and women who in their wisdom can call it the next generation. And God is raising up warriors to be the next generation of faithful. And I'm telling you, there's another piece. I was talking to a friend about this the other day. There is an anointing on us as adults that God has given us. But you need to know something. Get excited about this. Young people, I want to say something to you. You are going to get a greater anointing than we have. You are going to get a greater anointing than I have. You know why? Amen. There will be two reasons you'll get it. One, because the kings have been faithful. Okay? And that is our charge as adults, to be faithful, to stand up into the king call, men and women, to stand up into the fullness of them. But another reason, young men and women here, The reason you're going to have a greater anointing is because you're going to need one. You're going to need one. What's going on in the world and what is going on in the kingdom of God, there are things happening, there are things converging, and there is going to need to be, there is going to need to be men and women of faith who know how to stand not just in their theology but in the power and the life of God, the Holy Spirit, to bring the kind of change with love that can call people from the dead. And I believe that. Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit, just make that true among us. Help us to walk step by step. All we can do is respond to what we see and what we know one day at a time. Help us to continue one day at a time to say yes to you, to say yes to you, and that'll be enough, and it'll all be good. And all God's people said, amen. Amen.
