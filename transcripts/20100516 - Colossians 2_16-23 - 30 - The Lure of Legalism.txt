Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Well, before we get to the Word this morning, I have another brief announcement to make. This one is of a personal nature. My wife Bonnie is in North Carolina this weekend with our daughter Erica and our son-in-law Hain, who this last Thursday gave birth to their second child, our fifth grandchild. A son. A son. You know, this grandkid thing is amazing, and I kind of, you're in this little club when you become a grandfather or grandmother, And I know all of you, we talk about this when I bump into people who are grandparents as well. Wendy, who is Caleb's wife, is expecting any moment. So we're about to have our sixth grandkid. And I tease my kids. I mean, you know, Wendy, was it going to be Wendy or Erica? Wendy or Erica all week long. And I said, well, do you guys call each other? Like nine months ago, yeah, we're doing whatever. That's what I think, anyway. Eight pounds, 12 ounces. He's a keeper, 21 inches long. He's right in the slot side, so you can take him home. It's just so fun. Interesting thing. At least this is an interesting thing to us and our family. When he was born, Bonnie said, you know, we were all excited, and she was talking to me on the phone and says, Dave, he was born March 12th. I go, yeah, I know, I know. That's today. It's March 12th. He goes, Dave, that's your dad's birthday. And, you know, you've heard me talk about my dad enough to know. It made me go, what? You go, oh, whoa, on my dad's birthday. this little kid and his middle name is David, so he doesn't have a chance. But honestly, this week, it made me think of generations, of things that get passed down. And again, you've heard me talk of my dad, and he's a pastor, and I'm a pastor, but that's not what I'm talking about, that he would become a pastor. That's not it. It's about a kind of life that gets passed down, that you catch, that gets inside of you. It's about generations. It's about inheritance. A kind of inheritance, a kind of wealth that goes way beyond silver or gold. So I am very grateful. Let's pray as we go to the Word. Father, to be full of your Spirit as we listen to this, to be under the influence of your Spirit so that you have ears to hear is my request. And to be under the influence of your Spirit as I preach would be my request for me as well. to not be under the influence of anxiety or fear or even how it's going or how I look, to be under the influence of your Spirit, all of us, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, if you have your Bibles, open them to the book of Colossians, where we have been since the month of September, going verse by verse. As most of you know, for the last couple of weeks, Steve Weins, in the book of Colossians, has been focusing on Colossians 2, verses 6 and 7, where the Apostle Paul is talking about what it means to be in him. That is, what it means to be in Christ. So therefore, Paul says, Colossians 2, verse 6, As you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, having been firmly rooted and now being built up in him and established in your faith which is in him. And all of that is actually happening as we learn to be with him, to be with him. which is what Steve Weins has been talking about for the last couple of weeks quite brilliantly I think. Jesus plus nothing has been Steve's theme as we've kind of been camping out in this section in Colossians 2 and I just got to tell you as I was listening to Steve preach last week just sitting right over here how grateful I felt. Not only for Steve though I am very grateful for Steve but for a whole bunch of people here at Open Door. And many of them, and I don't know if you've noticed it, but many of them are younger men and women who understand and believe and are really trying to live this thing out that this message of Jesus plus nothing really is central to the gospel of the kingdom, to the teaching of Paul. And this message of Jesus plus nothing is actually worth fighting for and wondering about. and when I think of that this may be odd and I'm sure it's because of this birth of these children in our family that makes me think of generations as well and I don't know about you but I just thought it was incredible last week for us to get to meet Steve Ween's wife now many of you know this is Mary but many of you didn't meet Mary until last week when she stood up here and did that Mother's Day blessing you remember that? If you're here, you remember it. Again, sitting right over here, as she began to talk, it took my breath away. The heart of a poet, the heart of a mother who's got three little ones of her own. And it made me think of generations, of things being passed down, of a kind of life and a pursuit of God that is being passed on, and it made me feel grateful. For what I would call, and I haven't had words like this for this till now, but a spirit of inheritance, where you pass things on from one generation to another, things worth more than gold, and that spirit of inheritance is in this church. I think it's one of the marks of our church. Again, I have not had words for that until now. I think I'm right about that. There is a spirit of inheritance here, where things that are worth more than gold are getting passed on. They've come from someplace. They're going someplace, and it makes me feel grateful because we're rich and we have much to give, which speaks to responsibility to give it, this life, but also opportunity to give this life, which is the inheritance. But I digress. Back to the text, okay? Come with me. Paul says in verse 8, chapter 2, see to it, therefore, having been rooted in, built up in, and established in these things of Jesus plus nothing, see to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy or empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ. For in him, verse 9, all the fullness of deity dwells in a bodily form, and in him you have been made complete. In other words, it's Jesus plus nothing. Paul didn't say it that way. It's Jesus plus nothing. That's the way we've been saying it, because in him you have everything you need. Therefore, because all of that is true, verse 16, and I realize as we jump to verse 16, we're skipping several verses, that we will come back to, therefore, let no one act as your judge, Paul says, with regard to food or drink or to a festival or to a new moon or a Sabbath day. Those things aren't evil, but they're a mere shadow, says Paul, of what is to come. But the substance belongs to Christ, all of which at first glance sounds weird, like, okay, I'll be really careful to watch out for new moons, whatever that means. It's just kind of a bizarre language. I need to explain this a little bit. Here's what was going on in Colossae, among a number of other things. Apparently, someone or some group in Colossae was coming along and saying what people have said all along the way, and this is how the gospel gets muddied, that Jesus is not enough. That just loving Jesus is not enough. It's Jesus plus eating certain foods. That's why the reference to don't let anyone act as your judge with regard to foods. It's Jesus plus drinking certain drinks, celebrating certain religious festivals, a certain way, including the Sabbath. In fact, as in Colossae, a large number of people, in fact, initially, the largest number of people who were coming to faith in Christ were Jewish people. And this group of people would have brought with them into faith, into the church, as it were, a lot of these things, festivals, and the new moon kind of thing. It is very foreign to us. There were, there was in the background of Jewish believers, all of these festivals. There was a festival of Pentecost, a festival of tabernacles, the festival of lights, and all of that was part of their background. All of that was part of how they worshiped God. And when you offered your sacrifice in these various festivals, having been a Jew, you would do that sacrifice on the first day of the month, which explains the reference to the first moon, to the new moon. And the new moon is simply something a Jewish person would have understood. We think it's just weird sitting there in the verse. The new moon was an indication that we do our sacrifices when we go to the festival on the first day of the month. And there's nothing wrong with that, but the thing, the fly in the ointment that Paul is confronting is this, because it's become for you Jesus plus the festivals. There's nothing wrong with the festivals until you make it necessary. It's Jesus plus the Sabbath. It's Jesus plus doing the Sabbath and doing the festivals the right way on the new moon. And the problem, as I said, was not just that some Jewish Christians participated in the Sabbath day or in festivals. That wasn't the problem. The problem was that some of them had begun to judge people who didn't do the festivals. And it wasn't just about the festivals. It was about doing the festivals the right way. And it wasn't just about the Sabbath. It was about doing the Sabbath the right way. In other words, my way, which is the holy way, and so it's Jesus plus doing it our religious way, which just sounds so weird, doesn't it? I've never seen anything like that before, and you probably haven't seen anything like that before, unless you've ever gone to a church ever in your whole life. And let no one defraud you, he says in verse 18, moving on in the text. The word defraud there is interesting. It means to disqualify you. Let no one disqualify you. And actually, the picture there is that of an umpire who's looking at something and going, you're out. Let no one say to you, you're out. Read verse 18. Let no one keep disqualifying you of your prize by delighting themselves in self-abasement and the worship of angels. Let me clarify. It wasn't the worship of angels. It was worship with angels. By their self-abasement, by their self-discipline, they were claiming to attain to these supernatural experiences, ascending to the heights with the angels, taking stands on visions, supernatural experiences that they had seen inflated without cause. Again, these people, often through this extreme fasting, is what most of the commentaries point out, were claiming supernatural experiences with angels and visions, often inflated. In other words, what they were reporting in terms of their supernatural experience. They were reporting it as being better than it actually was. But the real problem was not. Paul is not confronting here having visions. Having a vision is a great thing. He was not confronting here supernatural experiences. Here's the problem. They were beginning to disqualify people who didn't have them the way they had them. So you're out. You're not in. You don't have it. And all of that stuff begins to defraud people, disqualify, as it were, you're not in, defrauding them of their prize. What would their prize be? Well, I suppose we could go in a number of different directions. I just went with the simplest thing that gets robbed when you're around this kind of spirit that says you just don't quite have enough. It deprives you of your joy in the Lord. That sweet awareness that we sometimes have to fight to find again, this awareness that God is in me. And he's happy to be there. And I am in him. And I don't have to jump through any more hoops to get him to love me more than he already does. But when this defrauding thing comes in and things start getting added to it, the answer to this question, am I okay? The answer is no, you're not okay, because now something's missing. You ever been around that? Sure you have. Now something's missing. You don't have everything you need. You haven't experienced everything you need to experience so that now instead of experiencing the joy of the Lord and resting in that and from that place of subtle joy and love, begin to live and love and grow in the grace and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, you begin to feel something that God didn't design you to feel relative to your life with Him. you begin to feel afraid and anxious. And you start asking questions. What am I missing? What don't I get? How do I get what I don't get? I mean, I don't see angels. And this guy does. And I'm somehow disqualified because of that. And I don't celebrate those festivals. At least I don't celebrate them that way. I didn't even know about these festivals when I came to faith in Christ. I didn't know I was supposed to do it that way. All of which explains at least part of why Paul says what he says in verse 9 when he says, in him, the fullness of the deity dwells in a bodily form, and in him you've been made complete, because it's not Jesus plus eating a certain food or drinking a certain drink or celebrating certain religious festivals a certain way or even experiencing supernatural visions. Though, if you do experience supernatural visions, it's great. tell us about it but it's not what qualifies you it doesn't make you better you don't get a higher standing indeed what qualifies you was found in verses 11 to 14 the verses we're going to come back to when Paul says in him you were circumcised with a circumcision made not with hands and again circumcision means nothing to us nobody in our church is walking around going yeah I was circumcised whatever but it wasn't that culture it was in that environment it was Jesus plus circumcision and Paul is saying you need to understand in Galatians he says it this way circumcision is nothing uncircumcision is nothing a new creation that's what we're focusing on it's Jesus plus nothing circumcision is fine supernatural experience is wonderful don't add it don't don't be disqualifying people because they have or they haven't we got to be someplace else as our bottom line. Therefore, back to the text, let no one act as your judge, let no one defraud you. It be the people who are doing that, saying Jesus plus whatever, he says then in verse 19, and this is where the temperature even gets a little higher, people who are doing this are not holding fast to the head. They're disconnected from Christ, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments grows with the growth which is from God. Verse 20, if therefore you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, which as if you were, which as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees such as do not handle, do not taste, do not touch. Submitting yourself to those decrees, that's what the elementary principles are. These are the ABCs. It's like what you tell a little child, don't touch that. Why are you still living like a child? Which all refer to things destined to perish with the using in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men. These are matters which have to be sure the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence. Now, that's a mouthful, a big, long text here this morning. Let me try to help you get the picture of what's going on here. Because the fact is this, that in the early church generally, and in Colossae specifically, there was a real conflict, contrary to many of the idealized perceptions we have of the early church. How many of you kind of know about that? Well, if we could just be like the early church. Well, they had all sorts of conflicts in that early church, and many of the conflicts are conflicts that we're still trying to work out ourselves. And the conflict in the early church that's being dealt with here is between, first of Well, Gentile believers who are coming to faith in Christ with no religious background and no religious baggage. And Jewish believers who are coming into faith in Christ with both a religious background and a religious baggage. Let's think about that for a little bit. What it means to have a religious background. What it means to have religious baggage. I think to have a religious background is a good thing. Jewish believers were coming to faith in Christ and in their coming to faith in Christ they came with some stuff the Gentiles didn't come with. Jewish believers were coming into faith with the knowledge of the Torah so they knew the Bible. That's an incredible thing to have. In fact, an exciting thing for them to see all the dots connect for them and many of them grew up in the synagogue so they had that as part of their background. They knew the traditions, the rituals, the ceremonies. When they walked into a synagogue they weren't blown away by what they did. They knew what they did, and they knew how it pointed. Now, they knew how all those things pointed to Christ. They valued worship, and they could do it quite easily. And some of you sitting in this room have come to faith in Christ that very way, with that kind of background. You've got some religious background. And it's why some of you find it easier to enter into certain kinds of worship. It's why some of you feel very comfortable in liturgy, because you grew up in that. And there might have been a period of time where it meant nothing to you, but then you came to faith, and the life of God came alive in you, and all of a sudden you look back and you go, whoa, there's all sorts of meaning there I didn't know. It was an easy thing for you to do because of the background you had, maybe even coming here to Open Door. Maybe you grew up at Open Door. And the way we do it here, which isn't better than anyone else, does it? Unless it's Jesus plus how Open Door does it, which it is for some of you. But when you came to faith, when God came alive in you, all of these things were really easily accessible to you, and they kind of came to life. You understand some systems of theology. The Bible is a hard book for a lot of us, but it's not entirely this mystery book, like it is for some Gentiles who never heard the Bible and never went to church. This whole stuff is weird to them. But with that background of religious stuff, where you know the Torah and the Bible and how churches work, you've also got some baggage. And while the background's good, the baggage isn't good. Can I get a witness from anybody about that? I mean, that's so, so funny, because so many of my friends, I run into people from time to time, and they actually, the way they identify themselves, how many can relate to this? I'm a recovering Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran. That's who I am. What is that about? What that says is, I have some background. There's some things I get, but I have some baggage, and my whole faith journey has been about trying to get rid of the baggage. Now hopefully you can recover enough from the baggage to go back and appreciate some of the background and get rid of the baggage. And some of you have done that, are in the process of doing that. I am. But others of you came to faith in Christ with no religious background and no religious baggage. You don't know the Torah. You don't know the Bible. You didn't grew up in the synagogue. You didn't grow up in the church. The language is so weird. And to have no background at all, and sometimes when you're sitting here, you kind of feel like an outsider. There's a deficiency there. You can make up for it, I think, quite easily. But it's harder to enter in for people like this sometimes, to understand why we or some other church would do this and do it that way. The songs at Open Door are weird, but the pastor's cool, so you kind of get over it that way. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. But think about it, think about it, think about it. To come to faith, and I don't have time to sit down and do some sort of sociological study here, but more and more this is happening. There's this postmodern thing where there's a generation of people, young people in particular, who never been to church. They have no religious context at all. So when they come to faith, they're coming with no background and they, so they feel a little bit out of it, but they have no baggage either and it really is Jesus plus nothing. And when people start trying to add to that, it gets very confusing for them. What are you doing to me? But even sometimes in their innocence, they latch onto the baggage. I just want to be a good Christian. If that's what it means, I'll jump through all these stupid hoops. Now, most of you know, I even already mentioned earlier today that I've grown up in church, which means that I came to faith as I see myself in this little paradigm I'm drawing here. I came to faith with background and baggage. The background is good. There are things I get. There are things I understand about the scriptures that I just, I don't even know why. I know why I get it. I have some background in this. But I also have some baggage. Fact is, most of the people in the church I grew up in, especially, this is mostly when I was a little kid because this really changed, particularly as my mom and dad went through a kind of a transformation of their own. But most of the people in the church I grew up in when I was a kid really did love Jesus. But there was just a boatload of Jesus plus stuff. There was a whole lot of we don't smoke and we don't chew and we don't go with girls who do stuff. A lot of rules, a lot of Jesus plus stuff that actually, right consistent with verse 23 in Acts, in Colossians chapter 2, had the appearance of wisdom. It did. It looked holy and spiritual in self-made religion, but was of no value against fleshly indulgence. It was of no value in trying to cultivate authentic spirituality marked by things like love and joy and peace. Indeed, what I remember feeling most as a kid growing up in that church system and the baggage that came with it, what I remember most was two things. One was arrogance that we felt when we kept the rules, and the other was fear. I mean, it's weird to have those two things together. Fear that we were somehow breaking the rules, not even sure what the rules were. So I have this vivid memory, and it just came back to me as I was kind of going through this text and trying to get a picture of what was going on here in Colossae of the fear in my own house. My mom, in particular, kind of evidenced this. I remember this one incident. I can't remember how old we were, but we were wondering if we could go see a movie called Sound of Music. Oh, how scandalous. Oh, I know, it's just so goofy to buy because we had one of our little Jesus Plus things was that good Christians, there's Christians and then there's good Christians, and that's what we were. We didn't go to movies. And if we go to a movie like Sound of Music, even if it's a good movie, people might see us and we will ruin our what? Reputation. That wasn't the word we used. It was testimony. Yeah. I remember as a kid in eighth grade, we had a gym class, and one of the things that came along every year was there would be a section where they would teach square dancing. And that's another thing we didn't do, because good Christians don't dance. And so this square dancing class coming up in my eighth grade class was causing great concern and agonized discussions about whether square dancing was something I could do that might ruin my testimony. And actually, we did. I took a letter. I took a note from my parents, and I gave it to my teacher to say that I couldn't square dance because, well, I don't know, because it would ruin my testimony. Wah, whatever. And I remember sitting on the sidelines and watching everybody square dance and at one level feeling superior. Oh, I didn't fall for this evil stuff, you know? And I know George over there. He's from our church, and he's dancing. I was so superior, you know? but at the same time I'm feeling all arrogant about that I'm all confused I'm all confused I really am I'm going this feels weird I can't feed off of this arrogance for much it's not it's not nourishing me much because I felt more stupid than holy because nobody was coming over to me going oh Dave tell us about this life you have the fact that you didn't square that just drew us to you so powerfully we want to know. Didn't happen. But here's the verse. Come out from among them and be separate and touch not the unclean thing. Eighth grade. Okay. Okay. What's the unclean thing? I'm not sure. Maybe it's eighth grade girls' elbows as you do-say-do, you know? as a 13 year old boy i'm telling you all of a sudden made me real curious about 13 year old girls elbows well see i got this verse then i did i i didn't know this verse then but i understood this verse then that these decrees such as do not handle do not taste do not touch have the appearance of spirituality but i knew in eighth grade they were of no value against fleshly indulgence which is why today I'm still kind of an elbow man anyway see I'm telling these jokes because my wife's in North Carolina but she'll see it tomorrow morning truth is what I felt most with my background in baggage was fear and primarily it was fear of other Christians who would surely act as my judge right in that verse let no one act as your judge relative to these things who would surely disqualify me and defraud me of my prize and it was mingled ironically as I've already said with this arrogance this sense of superiority toward people who didn't eat or drink the way we ate and drank who didn't do the festival the way we did the festival on the first day of the month, the new moon, who didn't do church the way we did church. And you could tell in our church who the marginal Christians were and who the really committed Christians were, not by love and joy and peace. I mean, we would talk about love and joy, but those weren't the things that marked you out as someone who really was living life in the kingdom of God. It was by how much you went to church. In fact, our big thing was Sunday morning, Sunday evening, Wednesday night prayer meeting. Remember that? Some of you, if you grew up in my thing, you know exactly what I'm talking about. And we even went as far as to say things like this. I used to hear these things, and it wasn't from my dad so much, because he went through this incredible change that scared everybody around him and finally won me. But Sunday morning, if you go to church Sunday morning, it means you love the church. If you go to church Sunday evening, it means you love the pastor. And if you go to church Wednesday night for prayer meeting, it means you love God. Great. So it's all a contest. I have a vivid memory, 10 years old, riding home from church, driving by a Catholic church, Sacred Heart Church, on the way home from Melrose Park Bible Church. There was a house fire. A priest was walking out of the church, and we were in our car just passing by. He was walking out of the church, across the street, to where this house fire was, to go and be with the people in that house who had lost just now everything they had. But he was smoking a cigarette. which, because of my background and baggage as a 10-year-old boy, meant he was the devil. Not of the devil, he was the devil. And it's really weird because it took a while to, because I can see that scene in my mind like it was yesterday, like a little movie, and how over time you begin to see that whole scene a different way because when I saw it originally, given my background and baggage, it never occurred to me that he, this priest, walking across the street to visit these people might have deeply loved Jesus and was visiting these people full of love and compassion. That never occurred to me, nor did I notice at the time that we, who were the really deeply committed Christians who had never smoked a cigarette, it never crossed our mind that we should go visit this family who just lost everything they had. What we talked about all the way home was this disgusting priest who smoked, full of contempt and arrogance too. we thought we knew well with all of that I've just given you you now have a picture of the Jewish-Gentile conflict going on in Colossae 2,000 years ago Gentiles coming to faith with none of the baggage but none of the background Jews coming to faith with all of the background they knew the Torah they had all that good stuff but all sorts of baggage but the real problem in Colossae was this that most of the time this religious spirit carried by the religious Jews won the day successfully intimidating people who were acting as their judge, defrauding them of their prize, and all of it based on food and drink and doing the festival and Sabbath the way we do the festival and Sabbath on the first day of the month, the new moon, and for all of that, Paul would go to war. Let no one act as your judge with respect to food or drink. Let no one keep defrauding you to the church in Galatia. Paul says in Galatians 5, verse 1, they were dealing there with Jesus plus circumcision. Paul says, it was for freedom that Christ has set you free, therefore keep standing firm. You have to fight for this, and don't be subject again to a yoke of slavery. Indeed, to the group in Galatia who were saying Jesus plus circumcision is what you need, Paul said in Galatians 5, verse 12, I love this, I would that those who are troubling you with this Jesus plus circumcision thing would mutilate themselves. What's he saying? Oh, stick with the circumcision. He's saying, you want to circumcise? You want to be circumcised? Go ahead. Circumcise yourself and slip. That's what he means by that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So if you think I get a little salty once in a while, I get it from Paul. It's a generational thing. The point among many is this, that this issue of Jesus plus nothing is something. It's a really big deal. And the fight for it will never end. My dad used to say legalists are like cockroaches. If that would offend you, by the way, Paul said they're dogs. Beware of the dogs. They're like cockroaches, he said. You may not see them, but they will never die. Just keep spraying. But even when you spray, don't think they're gone. This thing will never, ever die. Mind you, I had this memory. I'm thinking of that. I had this memory of the early time at Open Door, early years at Open Door here. It was so clear to me that what we had to spray was legalism. And we sprayed and we sprayed and we sprayed and we sprayed with Ephesians and then we sprayed with Galatians and we spent a year and a half in Galatians to set people free. We sprayed them. At the end of that, it felt like we were free. No more legalism. It's gone. The cockroaches are dead. Now whatever. And then all of a sudden, all of a sudden, this little thing, this little thing began to turn. Steve talked about it a little bit last week. And all of a sudden, this message of amazing grace, Jesus plus nothing, began to be the new legalism. And we began to get legalistic about grace. So if you didn't say it the way we said it, you were out, we disqualified you. And there it is, again. Makes me tired just thinking of it. It's very tiring. A couple things in the time we have left, just to kind of give you some pegs to put your thinking on. First of all, the lure of legalism. I've already said this, so I just want to give you a peg. Why are we drawn to this? I've already told you. First is because it provides a sense of superiority. That's why. Because the fact that I do what you don't do or I don't do what you do makes me feel superior to you, and that's kind of good. I don't think I'm doing it when I'm doing that, but that's part of it. The other thing is it provides a sense of security. Superiority and security and people most susceptible to this are insecure people, actually, without a strong sense of their identity in Christ, which is why Paul spends that whole, verses 11 to 14, he's going to talk about our identity in Christ. But if you don't have a strong sense of that, you're going to latch on real quickly to boundary markers that tell you you're okay. Because the boundary markers that I've chosen, whatever they might be, are what tells me I'm okay. Those are the things that tell me I'm in, that tell me I'm secure. But the problem is this, what's making you feel secure isn't Christ. In fact, if you're looking to something other than Christ to make you feel secure and like you're okay, you are disconnected from the head. Says Paul in verse 16. Second thing is the look of legalism, and I'm going to unpack this a little bit more next week. How do you spot this? What does it look like? What are the telltale characteristics? Because these things can be subtle. Well, the first thing you need to know is that the look of legalism almost always involves a very good thing that goes bad. See, reading your Bible is a good thing. Memorizing Scripture, spending time in prayer, all very, very good things. But in the religious system I grew up in, those things weren't presented as wonderful ways to give God access to your heart so you can grow. That's why you had studied the Bible, because it gives God access to my heart so I can become a more loving person. A lot of the people I hung around who studied the Bible became a more arrogant person. Drove you crazy. Because sometimes it becomes a contest. That doesn't mean there's something wrong with prayer or scripture when it becomes a contest. And it was a contest with winners and losers, and we found very creative ways to let people know how much time we were spending, how much stuff we were learning. And because you can measure that stuff, there were winners and losers. And in that system of winners and losers, I almost always felt like a loser for a number of reasons. But one, I wouldn't have known it then, but I'm ADD. You probably didn't know that. Yeah, I've mentioned it from time to time. It's bizarre. People kind of know it before I tell them. It's weird. I don't know why. We didn't have a word like that when I was a little kid. I couldn't sit still. So let's talk to little Davy Johnson about quiet time. Quiet time, and God will love you better if you do it that way. I would go crazy. I couldn't sit still. You have no idea what a relief it was, what a liberating thing it was to realize that ADD, guys like me, could listen to God and hear God's voice when they ran 10 miles. And I hear God now. I don't have to sit still. There's different ways to be with Him. The key is to learn how to be with Him, not to do it this way. Steve last week told us about how he gets up every morning and he looks at this picture of him in a pickup truck and Jesus is there to remind them, just with them, you're just with them every day in your proverbial pickup truck. In church in Colossae, there was another manifestation that kind of fit into this of Jesus plus, because it was Jesus plus supernatural experiences. Heavenly visions, and heavenly visions are awesome. Nothing wrong with them. Verse 18, they were delighting in self-abasement, which is the severe treatment of the body, extreme fasting, but it says they delighted in self-abasement. Why would you delight in self-abasement? Here's why. Because it meant they were winning. It was a contest. How much can you suffer for God? That was the contest. And they saw it as a means to supernatural experience, to worship with angels. They were ascending to the heights and heavenly visions. And the way you get there is to deny yourself self-abasement. So lots of people were jumping through these hoops, you know, self-abasement hoops, in order to experience this thing that these people had experienced, but they hadn't. So I need to, because something's missing. and here's the deal. In Colossae, just like here, there were some people in Colossae who were authentically experiencing supernatural things. And it's great, but some weren't. So what do you do if you're not? Well, you maybe have more than two options, but the two options I thought of were these. You can blow it all off. You can go, ah, yeah, yeah, here are supernatural experiences, you're lying. That's not real, it's of the devil even. In fact, that is my background. What we did with gifts of the Spirit when I was growing up was, they're not for today, and people who say they speak in tongues are speaking there. It's of the devil. Okay, whatever. That's one way to deal with it. Another one is if you really, really want that supernatural experience, but you're not getting it, is you can fake it. Pretend you're experiencing what you're not experiencing, and that's what Paul meant in verse 18 when he says, some of these people are inflated without cause relative to what they say they see or experience. Let me ask you a question. Does any of this sound familiar at all to any of you? I know it does. Because some of you grew up in a system not like mine. It was yours. And your system might have been Jesus plus supernatural experience. Jesus plus speaking in tongues. Anything wrong with speaking in tongues? No. But if it's Jesus plus speaking in tongues, if that's what makes you okay, you've disconnected yourself from the head. It's Jesus plus the baptism of the Spirit, the second blessing, the gifts of the spirit and those are prime examples of really good things that can go really bad i remember several years ago um um i i kind of had a journey with this whole gifts of the spirit thing kind of coming out of this background they aren't for today i couldn't find that in a text the text is saying i don't see the thing that says oh by the way don't expect much anymore um and i kind of went into a journey of of pursuing these things and trying to understand these things and and in the middle of that god gave me a prayer language the gift of tongues and I remember being scared to death to tell people, because I was pastor here when that happened, and I did tell people, but I was scared to tell people, because I thought two things would happen. People would either think less of me, he's an idiot, or they would think more of me. He's finally got it. And both of them were wrong. Both of them were wrong, because circumcision is nothing. Uncircumcision is nothing. I'm not saying those things are bad. Jesus is the issue. Jesus is the core. Tongues, I'm not saying that's bad. Tongues are not the issue. Having it, not having it. Jesus is the core. don't be making that Jesus plus this. Then you start defrauding people, disqualifying people. I'm gonna fight about that, says Paul. And me too. See, some of you move quite easily in the gifts of the Spirit and supernatural things. Some of my best friends do. I love this about them, and they hear God in supernatural ways, but some of you don't. So what do you do if you don't? Well, one tendency is to take all the people who claim to hear God in a way that you don't hear God and go, ah, you're full of baloney. That's a bunch of junk. Or the other thing is if you really value it, but you're not getting it, is you pretend you're seeing it when you're not seeing it, hearing it when you're not hearing it. All of which leads to the second characteristic, to the look of legalism. Because when this kind of environment is cultivated, and it can happen, it almost always happens unintentionally. We don't know that we're creating this soup when we're creating this soup. But when the soup is created, It invariably, unavoidably brings with it a religious spirit where before you know it, image is everything. And how things look is what matters most. And pity the fool who in a system where how things look is what matters most doesn't look good. Pity the fool who in a system like this doesn't see visions, doesn't do it right, begins to ask questions. And now my mind goes to Galatians 5, Matthew 23, and we will pick it up right there. next week. An abrupt ending. But I want to speak a benediction over you. And let this go with you into next week. Would you stand with me as I just give you this? Let no one act as your judge with regard to food and drink and festival or a new moon or Sabbath or how you do it. and don't let anyone defraud you or disqualify you because they've got it and you don't. Keep standing firm in the freedom with which Christ has set you free. And don't turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh. Paul says also in Galatians, don't, all of a sudden I'm free. No, that'll just become another kind of bondage. But to stand firm in your freedom, to do that, you have to start wondering and here's our work and Steve started us on this work last week. Where has it become for me? And where has it become for you? Jesus plus. What's the Jesus plus? And it's probably not circumcision. Pretty sure. And it's probably not Jesus plus festivals or new moons or the worship of angels. So what is it for you? What is it for me? And what is it for us? Because God's calling us out of Egypt. See, it's just another kind of Egypt. Holy Spirit, come and continue to call us, your people, out into a good and spacious land where we can breathe and experience the joy of the Lord, where you really are the head and we are connected to you and all these other things can find their proper place. We pray it in Jesus' name and all God's people said, amen. Amen. God bless you as you leave. you
