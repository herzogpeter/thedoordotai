I'd like you to open your Bibles with me to 1 John 5, verse 21, as we enter our second week of examining this final verse of John's epistle. This is a study of John's epistle we began last September. If I sit on this last verse long enough, make it a whole year. In this last verse, John simply says this, little children, guard yourselves from idols. a strange way to conclude we noted a couple weeks ago until we connected it up to the previous verse in the broader context of the epistle where John is speaking much like a father to his beloved children in the faith children who for a variety of reasons most notably the undermining influence of some very persuasive false teachers that over the course of our study we've come to know as the Gnostics, the Docetists, the Cerinthians these children of faith that John had given spiritual birth to, because of these false teachers' influence, had lost the confidence that normally marked their walk of faith. And so, like a father, intervening just at the right time, with words laced with love but steely strong, he says to his beloved children basically this, there are some things you need to know. And there are some things you need to remember that you already know. and among the things you need to know most, especially here as I close in chapter 5, you need to know this, he says, verse 20, that the Son of God has come and that he has given us understanding in order that we might know him who is true and that we are in him who is true in his Son, Jesus Christ. In other words, little children, my beloved sons and daughters, you need to know that the one in whom you have placed your trust, from whom you have been drawing your confidence, is worthy of your trust and confidence, because he is true. You need to know that the Gnostics are wrong. Jesus is not a vapor, belonging to some feathery realm, disconnected from the realities of life, with which you must deal every day. No, this Jesus, who we have seen with our eyes, and heard with our ears, and handled with our hands, chapter 1, verse 1, is the one true God, chapter 5, verse 20. He is the one true source of the eternal kind of life that I have been inviting you into, says John, since chapter 1, verse 1. Therefore, because of all of that, verse 21, little children, my final word and warning to you is this. Guard yourselves from subtle substitutes. Guard yourselves from false Christs, from false perceptions of the one who is the one true God and the eternal life. Why is that an important thing? Because a false perception of Christ we noted two weeks ago makes it almost impossible to relate to him rightly. It undermines and mitigates against our ability to love him deeply, obey him courageously, believe him tenaciously, follow him faithfully, pray to him expectantly, Listen to him carefully. Why? Because if your perception of Christ has in any way been reduced from who he really is, if you have come to believe in any even subtle way that he isn't truly God or he isn't really true or that he has no practical relevance to life as it is lived in the real world, then why on earth would you listen to him, obey him, believe in him, follow, or even desire to know him? If he is not the one true God and the eternal life who has something practical to say to your real life, why on earth would you take him seriously at all? The answer to that is you wouldn't. My thesis of two weeks ago was basically this, that most people don't take him seriously. And my greater concern is this, that even some who would call themselves Christians don't really take him seriously either. we, in ways that we are not always aware, have fashioned for ourselves false Christs. False perceptions of Christ that are primarily designed to serve us. Primarily designed to affirm what we already believe and endorse what we already value and how we already live. Therefore, my beloved little children, guard yourselves from false perceptions of Christ. David McCullough in his book, The Trivialization of God, says all that this way. Visit a church on Sunday morning, almost any will do, and you will likely find a congregation comfortably relating to a deity of their own creation. One that fits nicely into a set of precise doctrinal positions who lends almighty support to whatever their cause of the month might be. But you will not likely experience a significant sense of awesome presence or holy mystery. And kind of bringing in some of our language over the last couple of weeks, you will not likely find a group of people who are courageously obeying, tenaciously believing, boldly loving, or carefully listening, who are seriously taking the words of Christ to heart. it goes on to say that the only sweaty palms will be those of the pastor who didn't prepare very well his sermon so he's unsure whether it's going to go over the only shaking knees will be those of the soloist about to sing the offertory and wondering if they can hit the high notes you see reverence and awe have often been replaced by a yawn of familiarity the God who is indeed a consuming fire has been domesticated by us into a candle flame, providing it, indeed, a bit of religious atmosphere, but no heat, no blinding light, no power to save or purify the hearts of men and women. Well, if that's true, no wonder so many people who go to church are bored right out of their minds. Why? Because without even knowing it, Many people, I believe, are going to church and coming into the presence of their worshiping, not actually worshiping, their tipping their hat to a false Christ. A Christ that does not exist. A Christ that they have created to serve themselves. A Christ that affirms what they already believe, what they already value, and endorses how they already live. And a Christ like that is infinitely boring. He will never call you to anything. He will never challenge you in any way. two weeks ago I identified two of the false Christs that John implicitly all through this epistle is trying to expose and to confront today a third the two I gave you so far are these first false perception is that Jesus is a bit of a pushover that he's not very smart that he can't really tell what's real that he functions a bit like what I called last week a magic wand remember how that works here's how it works you say the magic words? He waves the magic wand. You have eternal life. How do you know you have eternal life? Well, you said the magic word. You signed the magic card. You walked the magic aisle. You prayed the magic prayer. This false Christ that I dressed out in great detail last week, at no time says to you things like, I want you to obey me. I want you to believe me. I want you to know me. Take up your cross and follow me. No, this Christ says basically this. Let's make a deal. Here's the deal. You say the magic words. I'll wave the magic wand. You'll have eternal life. Basically the deal is a fire insurance policy. You'll go to heaven when you die. Your future is secure, but I won't touch your real life now. So you can keep your bitterness and you can keep your pride and you can keep your anger and your gossip and your slander and your lust and you can keep all that and still know that you have eternal life. How do you know? We made a deal. You said the magic words. I waved the magic wand. You have eternal life. Let me tell you what I think you have. If you think that, I think you have a false Christ and you have a false hope as well. All of that, by the way, at least in part explains how it is that we can live in a country where 74% of the people in it claim to have a personal relationship with Christ, yet in whom there is no discernible evidence of the transforming life of God. How is that possible? It's not that hard. It's not that great a mystery. It's possible because many people have a false Christ who said, let's make a deal. They have not bent their knee to, nor entered into relationship, the one who is, verse 20, true. They have not entered into what John calls an eternal kind of life made possible by the one true God and the eternal life, even Jesus Christ himself. Second false perception of Christ we dealt with last week is the polar opposite of the first, rejecting the idea that he's a pushover, almost as a corrective to that idea. Some have come to see him, perceive him as a tyrant. One false move, you're dead. But this perception John also refutes from the beginning of his epistle to the end. For God, as he has been most accurately revealed to us through his son Jesus, is above everything else that he is, love. And this is love, chapter 4, verse 10. Not that we loved him, but that he loved us and sent his son. which means among other things this that he did not just sit in heaven loving us from a distance. His love for us is passionate, relentless, pursuing. He was willing to pay an enormous price to win us, reconcile and redeem us making this glorious promise to us that if we would open wide our hearts to what we've been calling the furious love of God that that love coming to us will radically change us and that that change will change who we are, how we live, who and what and how we love. And all of that leads to the third false perception that I want to deal with this morning. Third false perception is this, that he is tame or that he can be tamed. This Jesus, who John refers to in verse 20 as being the one true God and the eternal life is many things, including love. But even in his expression of love for us, he is not tame. He is a God of passion and pursuit. He is not passive or predictable. And while because he loves us, he desires the absolute best for us, his highest priority in this relationship that he has covenanted to be in with us, the highest priority of it is not that we feel comfortable. Let me explain that. Entering into a covenant relationship with God through Christ, often referred to in Scripture and a metaphor that we have embraced around here and I speak of all the time is that of a marriage. The groom being Jesus, the bride being the church, and entering into that marriage relationship is entering into the adventure of a lifetime. An adventure marked by and requiring, quite frankly, if you hope to survive this relationship, tenacious believing, courageous obeying, bold loving, intimate knowing. It is not a relationship. If you've married the groom that we see in Scripture, it is not a relationship that is going to teach you how to play it safe. Why is that? Because of who you're married to. Because of who the groom is. It is the character of the groom and the analogy of Christ being the groom and we being the church that affects something about how this relationship is going to be. What it's going to feel like to be in it. Think about it this way. Do you know who you're married to? I mean do you have any idea what this guy is really like now I'm just going to put this in human terms and women you might be able to enter into this a little bit better men you got to come along here and just kind of use your imagination and pity the women who have to wonder about this but women you get married and you know you think you know him and six months later you go who is this guy some of you have even spent a lot of time and energy thinking you could change this guy and tame this guy hopefully you did domesticate him to me if he's a pig he needs to not be a pig but some of you have had a strange experience of going this guy is a wild man who is he church here's the word church that's a really minuscule picture of what I want to call you to church of Jesus Christ bride of Christ take a step back do you have any idea who you're married to he loves you beyond anything you can imagine he will never leave you or forsake you but you better know something about Jesus this groom he's a bit of a wild man and if you think comfort is his highest priority for this relationship you don't know him and if you think you can tame him you're going to lose him and if you don't lose it, you will lose the passion of the romance, I promise you that and by the way, this loss is what explains the apathy, I think in many churches, a redefinition of who the groom really is and what he calls for and what he's invited us into in this thing we call the marriage between the groom which is Christ and the bride which is his church so who is he? is cruel. Well, John says he is the one true God and the eternal life. Well, that's a nice little Bible verse. We'll do that and say he is the one true God. You get the answer right. No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hello. Stop. Take a step back. What do you think it feels like to get close to the one true God and the eternal life? The one who by the word of his power put the stars in their place. Let's get next to that. Do you feel any energy at all? Do you feel any heat? If you don't, you don't know who he is. This is the one true God and the eternal life. Other places in Scripture, he's called the Lamb of God. He is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. I like lambs. In fact, with the lamb analogy, I did take a breath. This guy was scaring me all this energy here now, but he's a lamb. I like lambs. I like lambs. You can cuddle up till lambs are soft and cuddly and even make a little, make a little nice little, you know, a little stuffed lamb. Hold him here. It's just nice and soft. I like that. I want you to know something. He is the lamb of God. And if you ever lose the lamb dynamic of who our groom is, you will miss who the groom is. But you also need to know that he's not just lamb, he is lion. And in the combination, well, which is he? He is both. And if you lose one, you lose who the groom is. You take away the lamb, you have something terrible and destructive, the lion. If you take away the lion, you have something weak and pathetic. Just a soft, cuddly. No, that's not who he is. He is the lion and the lamb. He is passionate in his pursuit, not passive or predictable. And continuing with this analogy of marriage, him being the groom, we being the bride, in his invitation to us to enter into marriage, his invitation to us is an invitation not just to be held by him or to be with him, though it certainly includes that. If we get married, I'm going to hold you, says the groom to the bride. I'm going to be with you. I'm going to nurture you. I'm going to protect you. But there's something, says the groom to the bride, that I want you to know about what being married to me means. see my highest priority in our marriage is not that we would just sit and hold each other though I love doing that it's not just saying come and sit on my lap and feel safe I love that but that is not the essence you see I'm on a mission from my father to destroy the works of Satan and I am looking for a partner who will join me in that you want a hug? great we're going to do that a lot but the fundamental dynamic of our relationship is about a cause that I have committed. It's what I'm about. So if you come into this marriage relationship, says the groom to the bride, you can expect some things. You can expect to be loved. You can expect to be protected. You can expect that I will never leave you nor forsake you, but you can also expect to climb some mountains, to cross some rivers, to walk into some wildernesses. And if you come into this marriage relationship, you're really going to need to bring your courage and your faith and your love. Because the purposes to which I am committed is to destroy the works of Satan that steals, kills, and destroys, to advance the kingdom of God. You want comfort? There will be times when we feel great satisfaction. But if you're looking for a house in the proverbial suburbs, that's just not what I'm about. Maybe you should marry someone else. And I think some of you have married someone else, and you're calling him Christ. You've constructed a Christ that says, I'll just hold you. It'll all just be about hugs. That's all. if you have no idea what I'm talking about if you have never tasted or been stirred by this dimension of our life with Christ the groom who says it's not just about hugs it's about mission as well maybe if you think I'm talking like from outer space right now maybe it's because you're not really interacting with the God who is true maybe it's because you're not really interacting with the God who by the word of his power put the stars in their place maybe you have grown quite comfortable with the God of your creation that you have made to serve you to affirm what you already think what you already value what you already love you have domesticated him in the worst possible way for your perception of Christ is that he is tame, requiring nothing, calling for nothing. His greatest contribution to your life is to make you comfortable. I wonder if you know him. Dorothy Sayers says it this way. I fear that the church of Jesus Christ has efficiently paired the claws of the Lion of Judah, making him a household pet for pale-skinned curates and pious old ladies, end quote. What she's saying is we've tamed him. The truth, however, in my mind is this. You can't tame him. What we've done is far more serious. We've redefined him. And if you've redefined him and you think you're in relationship with him, you may be in relationship with a false Christ who is not really the groom that we read about here. One of my favorite scenes in C.S. Lewis' wonderful allegory of kingdom life, the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe, is when Susan, upon hearing that Aslan, the son of the great king, is in fact a lion, expresses concern about that. She says this, I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion. I thought he was a man. And then her question, very good question, appropriate, I think, is this, is he safe? Safe, said Mr. Beaver. Who said anything about safe? If by safe you mean predictable, comfortable, manageable, risk-free, and passive, then no, he isn't safe, but he is good. And you can trust his strength. He isn't like those who use their strength to crush or use or manipulate or control. and with that phrase I want to take a step back and acknowledge something. This dynamic of the groom's character which is really speaking of a fierceness, if you will, a strength. In fact, we've talked about feminine strength in our church. This is speaking of the rightly ordered masculine strength of God that needs to be evident among his people, both men and women. But the problem we have, one of the problems we have is that we live in a world that has been marked by disordered masculine strength where the kind of masculine strength we have seen has been used to destroy people and crush people and manipulate people so much so that some of us have come to believe that any form of masculine strength is evil. So we try to declaw it all together. You have lost it all. he isn't safe but he is good he isn't just lion he is lamb he isn't just like he is bull it's a hard combination to understand its mystery Kenneth Graham in his wonderful fantasy book The Wind in the Willows much like Lewis's allegory gives a wonderful window through which we can look so as to better see and more clearly understand this glorious mystery of lion and lamb together. In an imaginary dialogue between the rat and the mole, the rat whispers, this is the place of my song dream, the place the music first played to me, here in this holy place, here if anywhere, surely we will find him. Then suddenly the mole felt a great awe fall upon him an awe that turned his muscles to water, bowed his head, rooted his feet to the ground. It was, however, no panic, terror. Indeed, he felt wonderfully at peace and happy. But it was an awe that smote him and held him. And without seeing, he knew that it could only mean that some august presence was very, very near. Perhaps he would never have dared to raise his eyes, but the call, the summons to look was irresistible. Trembling, he obeyed and raised his humble head and then he looked into the very eyes of the friend, the helper. Rat, he found breath to whisper, shaking, are you afraid? Afraid, murmured the rat, his eyes shining with unutterable love. Afraid of him? Oh, never, never. And yet, and yet, oh, I am afraid. Then the two animals, crouching to the earth, bowed their heads and worshipped. You see, beloved, the real danger of a trivial God or a false perception of Christ as being tame is that a tame Christ will never turn your muscles to water. A tame Christ will never bow your head or root your feet to the ground. A tame Christ will never overwhelm you with wonder-filled awe in the presence of the only friend and helper who has the power to save you and heal you. A tame Christ will never stir in you a passionate desire to obey him courageously, believe him tenaciously, love him deeply, follow faithfully, listen carefully, die willingly. Because a tame Christ doesn't call for any of those things. A tame Christ doesn't call you to anything that would require those things. Just go to church, says the tame Christ. sing the song do your duty no wonder people are bored out of their minds when they go to church or think about the God life my little children says I mean this little phrase that you could just kind of skip and not even know that we missed it I just know I could have ended 1 John with verse 20, and we would have known. This may be the most important thing he says. Little children, guard yourselves from false perceptions of Christ, because if you have a diminished view of Christ in any way, you will not be able to rightly relate to him. Several weeks ago, a friend of mine told me that John Eldridge, the author of two of my favorite books over the last couple of years, the Sacred Romance and the Journey of Desire, had written another book. It was called Wild at Heart. Now, I'd read that book just because John Eldridge wrote it, but the title got me. I love that title, Wild at Heart. Anything with that word wild, I would read that. I love the title. The book was better. I read it on vacation just a few weeks ago. Like his other books, he spoke of what he calls the wild love of God. And then in this particular book, he invites his readers, and this particular book, all three weren't this way, but this one was particularly directed to men. He invites them to enter into that wild love of God and then to live out of a heart marked by passion, adventure, courage, and faith. But there's a problem, he said. In fact, the whole book was kind of about addressing this problem. It's this, that most men you meet in church aren't marked by passion, adventure, courage, and faith. Be honest, he says. Walk into most churches in America, have a look around. What do you see? You have to admit that an awful lot of Christian men, and many women too, are bored. I mean, that got my attention. I like reading people who think like me. Anyway, they're bored, he says. Here's his theory as to why. When all is said and done, I think most men in church have come to believe that God put them on the earth to be a good boy. The problem with men, we are told, is that they don't know how to keep their promises, be spiritual leaders, talk to their wives, or raise their children. All very real problems. The solution, however, they're given is this, that if they try really hard, don't swear, don't smoke, don't drink, they can reach one day, maybe, the lofty summit of becoming a really nice guy. How many of you just kind of go, yeah. For some, says Eldridge, that is what is thought to be the summit of Christian maturity, nice. Even better, if we're really going to go for it, really nice guys. There's nothing wrong with being a nice guy. I'm thinking this through. I certainly don't want to be a mean guy. I mean, the mean picture is disordered masculine strength that is used to crush people, defiles people, has nothing to do with God. But if being nice is indeed the pinnacle of what Christian maturity looks like for men or women, no wonder people are bored. speaking just for me this is just me niceness does nothing for me niceness stirs nothing in me it's like vanilla it feels insipid and by the way this is weird I use vanilla as an illustration I like vanilla but here it's yucky well you know again i don't want to be mean but it's nice it doesn't inspire me and i and i was thinking because i was really as i was reading a book i'm going i like how this guy talks this is how i think and feel it was more how he felt and i put the book down i wonder why is it that i feel that when i was able to identify it here's why niceness doesn't call me to anything niceness doesn't call me to courage. It doesn't call me to passion, fidelity, or faith, which I believe are all things that I desperately need to do my life. If I am going to be a husband who loves his wife, indeed lays down his life for his wife, and loves his children, and learns more and more what that means, and to live in this world with integrity, I need more than nice. I need more help than nice. I need something to call me to courage and passion and fidelity. and faith. It's not that nice is bad. It's not enough. Maybe the reason we are drawn to niceness and even want to kind of define God as a nice guy and we should be like him so we all become nice guys. Maybe the reason we go there is because it is safe. And it is tame. And maybe we would even admit that it's not exciting but at least no one gets hurt with nice and at this point I can understand and once again I need to step back and acknowledge that by disordered masculine strength many many people have been crushed and I'll tell you if the choices are only between disordered masculine strength and just being nice let's go for nice because at least no one gets hurt it's just not what God has called us to as men and women who are the bride of Christ partnering with him in the cause of the kingdom that's more than nice. Maybe, Eldridge postulates, the reason that some have reduced their definition of Christian maturity to just, to being a really nice guy is because we have reduced our perception of Christ himself to being not much more than the world's nicest guy. Kind of like Mr. Rogers with a beard. That's Jesus. Well, if Jesus is Mr. Rogers with a beard, now my job as a pastor is even kind of defined. Here's my, oh, I'll quit, because here's my thing. It's like, dearly beloved, Sunday morning, here's the glorious, eternal, beyond you call of God on your life as both men and women. Here it is. Are you ready? Do you think, you know, fashion your seatbelts. Here it is. Be nice. Be swell. Be Mr. Rogers. be like all the depictions of Jesus that I saw when I was a little kid growing up in movies or in pictures that saw him as passive and pathetic and weak but he's nice isn't he nice who do you want to marry someone nice okay and in six months or six years you'll be bored stiff in your marriage and you'll wonder where the passion is. Philip Yancey poignantly asks this question around this whole issue when he says, do you really believe that Jesus that all Jesus was was nice? Do you really believe that the Roman government would execute Mr. Rogers or Captain Kangaroo? I mean, that's a weird way to put it. It got my attention. No, no. You know why? Because Mr. Rogers, Captain Kangaroo, would not call for the kind of passion that someone who the Roman government would see as a threat would execute. What kind of person is this that could call for men and women, the kind of loyalty that came to him? What kind of man is this that could call forth the kind of hatred that came toward him? Mr. Rogers. I'd much rather be told, says John Eldredge, to be like William Wallace. And when he said that, I added, I'd much more likely follow William Wallace. Even if I had to die, I'd follow a guy named William Wallace. Who's William Wallace? Three or four of you might be asking. Well, here's the deal. Hang on to your hat here, and I don't know. Because William Wallace is the hero of my favorite movie on the planet. I'm sorry to admit, and that's life. Braveheart. Braveheart. Yeah, the one with Mel Gibson and the painted face. And I know you all think less of me now. But you just might as well get used to it. I'll tell you, William Wallace was a wild man. He wasn't safe. but he was good. And while it might feel like a bit of a stretch to see him as a type of Christ, just work with me here for a few minutes. Let me help you with this. Let me tell you the story. William Wallace was a warrior poet who came as a liberator of Scotland in the early 1300s. When Wallace arrives in the scene, Scotland has been under the iron fist of English monarchs for centuries. Centuries. People have been held in the grip of the evil one. The latest monarch was the worst of them all, Edward the Longshanks. Under his rule, Scotland was devastated. Her sons were being killed. Her daughters were being raped. The Scottish nobles, who were supposed to be protectors of the flock, instead of doing that, were piling heavy burdens on the backs of the people that they were there to serve. All the while, lining their own pockets by cutting secret deals of compromise with the evil king, Longshanks. Wallace is the first one to come along who's got both the courage and the authority to stand up to and defy the English oppressors and bring people into freedom outraged that anyone would have the gall to challenge him Longshanks sends his armies to the field of Sterling to crush this upstart rebellion the Highlanders come down it's time for a showdown but the nobles, cowards, every one of them don't want to fight. They want to be nice. They want a treaty with England. But not just because they're nice. They want a treaty with England because it will buy them more lands and they will get more power and they don't care at all about the people that they are there to serve and shepherd. They're in my mind typical Pharisees and bureaucrats, religious types. Without a leader to follow, without a shepherd to guide, without a father to call them out, the Scots begin to lose their heart. One by one, then in larger numbers, they start to walk away from the battle that could give them freedom and protect their families and their children. At just the right moment, in the nick of time, Wallace rides in with his band of warriors, a ragtag group reminiscent of some raw-boned fishermen who one day followed Jesus. ignoring the noblemen who were still trying to make friends with the enemy and parlay their compromise into more land and power for themselves Wallace did a wonderful thing he went straight for the hearts of these fearful beaten down Scots saying this sons and daughters of Scotland you have come to fight as free men and free men you are in that phrase he gave them an identity and a reason to fight. He reminds them in that phrase that there you that he reminds them that a life lived in fear is no life at all and that every last one of them will die one day and then he says this and dying in your beds many years from now would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that to come back here and tell your enemies that they may take your lives but they will never take your freedom. End of speech. Now all that is, is the land of Scotland. But see what I hear echoing in my ears are these. The Apostle Paul saying this, it was for freedom that Christ has set us free. Keep standing firm in that freedom and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery. And if you don't want to be subject again to a yoke of slavery, you may have to fight from time to time. You may have to learn to stand up and say no from time to time and abolish your idols and follow the one who is the one true God. At the end of Wallace's speech, as you can imagine, they're ready to go. They'd run through a wall for this guy. He has invited them, not to a group hug, you know what? At the end of the battle, they hugged. In fact, there were high fives all over. And they hugged. But that's not what he invited them to primarily. Let's just hug, okay? No! He invited them to partner with him in a cause that would set people free, in a cause that would heal the land. But it was a cause that could cost every single one of them every single thing they had, including their lives. And every single one of them said yes. here's my question what kind of man is that what kind of person is it that is able to stir in the hearts of men and women such loyalty, love and belief in what he says that they would leave everything they have to follow him Mr. Rogers with a beard I don't think so Dietrich Bonhoeffer who died in Nazi prison, a faithful follower of Jesus till the end. Of Jesus said this, when Jesus calls a man, he bids him come to die. Imagine with me in your mind's eye when Jesus said to Peter, James, and John, known by their friends as the sons of thunder, Come follow me. What did they see in him? What did they hear from him? How did he stir in them such loyalty and love? How did he get from them a yes? These guys, I don't think, were easy. Fishermen, some of them. Raw-boned people. A few weeks ago, I compared what they were in terms of their physical presence to being dock workers. These guys were union. They weren't easy. Mr. Right, you want to come? I don't think so. Hmm. You know, the movie, again, I see these movies in my mind that I grew up with, with Jesus being this passive. He says, hello. In fact, you know, you know, well, we do. We watch the movies our kids watch, especially when they were little. It's kind of like, that's not okay, and you can't watch this, and you can't filter that stuff. When I was growing up, my dad was really big on it. He couldn't stand these passive perceptions of Jesus. And we'd be, he'd walk in, we're watching a movie, and you go, what are you watching? We go, I did this movie. He goes, and there's Jesus going, hello. And you go, turn that stuff off! That's garbage anyway. What kind of man was he? This Jesus, who could elicit this kind of loyalty? Mr. Rogers? I don't think so. Much more like William Wallace, who bids me come to follow him, to one day become like him, to right now in this life partner with him in a cause that is just what is his cause. I'm not talking about William Wallace now. As noble as that was, it wasn't near what this cause is. Here is the cause that the groom invites the bride to partner in him with. I am come to destroy the works of Satan. Come partner with me. I am come to move against the strongholds of the evil one and I want to do that through my bride to church. strongholds of the evil one that destroy and disfigure the lives of men and women and children in Robinsdale, Minnesota and in Maple Grove, Minnesota strongholds that diminish the glory of God in marriages and churches and schools and cities strongholds that hold people captive locked in a prison of hopelessness fear and sin he bids me come to follow him no, to marry him to partner with him maybe even to die with him but with this promise that William Wallace could never give that he who loses his life for my sake shall surely find it what kind of life will you find abundant life fulfilling life bigger than you life an eternal kind of life and I promise you if you enter into the relationship with the one who really is the groom, the ride of your life. Well, how can he promise that? Here's how he laid down his life. Well, wait a minute. William Wallace did that. I mean, that's nice. There we go again with the nice thing. That's noble. But just laying down your life, he's dead. Well, you know the rest of the story. See, God raised him up again. A fact to which we are all witnesses, said Peter in Acts 2, verse 32. And when he rose from the dead, he turned around and said, Because I live, so will you. So bride of Christ, come partner with me. You've got nothing to lose. See, even if you die, you live. Even if you lose, you win. What kind of man is this? Is he Mr. Rogers or William Wallace? Fact is, neither. He's neither of those. Is he lion or is he lamb? fact is he's both. Take away the lion, you have weakness. Take away the lamb, you have destruction. He is both. You can't separate them. And in that picture is mystery. Maybe the best understanding of who he is is what John says. He is the one true God and the eternal life. Get up next to him. Can you feel the heat? Can you feel the strength? Can you feel the raw energy of the one who is the eternal life, who bids me come to follow him, to one day become like him, to right now partner with him? What kind of man is this? It's the kind that stirs in me a passionate desire to obey him courageously and love boldly and believe tenacious and follow faithfully and serve carefully, serve gratefully to die willingly. All of which, all of which is why John closes his epistle with this final little phrase, little children, guard yourselves from idols, from false perceptions of the one who is the one true God. Because if you diminish who he really is, you will not be able to rightly relate to him. And all of the passion to obey him courageously, love him boldly, believe him tenaciously, will dissipate away. And in this marriage, you will be bored beyond belief. And you will miss the life he's called you to. Therefore, little children, my beloved children in the faith, Do not let your perception of Christ be diminished. In this marriage with the groom, work really hard continually to find out who he is and who he is and who he is so you can rightly relate to him and partner with him in the cause to which he has called us. And all God's people said, Amen. Let's pray as we close. Father, I thank you for the fact that the Son of God has come. And I thank you for the fact that he has given us understanding in order that we might know him who is true. And I thank you that we are in him who is true, even his Son, Jesus Christ. And I thank you that he is the one true God in the eternal life. Help us to know him and partner with him. In Jesus' name, amen.
