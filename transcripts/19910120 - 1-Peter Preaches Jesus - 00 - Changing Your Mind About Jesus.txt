Open your Bibles to Acts chapter 2. Picking our study up in the 22nd verse of that chapter, we're going to go through verse 36 this morning. As we enter our study today, I want to remind you that we are in this morning, the second part of Peter's sermon, where he is explaining the amazing events of Pentecost that were explained to us at the beginning of this chapter. I want you to be mindful of the fact, as we continue to move through these events, that actually they began back in Matthew 28 when Jesus, to a group of 500 people, including the disciples, gave a commissioning, a commissioning that was absolutely beyond anybody's capacity in the flesh to fulfill. The commissioning was simply this, Go now, therefore, into all the world and preach the gospel. Knowing that this commissioning that he gave in Matthew 28 was indeed beyond anyone's capacity in the flesh to fulfill, Jesus in Acts chapter 1 made a promise, and the promise was for empowerment, described in Acts chapter 1 verse 8 as an empowerment brought by the Spirit to make men and women witnesses, not just in Jerusalem, but in Judea and Samaria and the uttermost parts of the world. There would be an empowerment to do this commissioning. And in Acts chapter 2, that empowerment arrived. While we discovered a couple of weeks ago that the purpose of that empowerment was to bring a harvest of souls, we also discovered that that empowerment was marked by certain things. First of all, it was marked, verse 2 and 3 of chapter 2, with signs and wonders. The wind blew, fire appeared. It was marked also by the empowerment of common Galileans, proclaiming the mighty deeds of God in languages that everyone could understand. And it was marked third of all by the clear, empowered by the Spirit, proclamation of the word of God. It was marked by preaching. Verse 14, Peter then took his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them, Men of Judea, and he began his sermon. The first part of Peter's sermon we dealt with last week had as its body the prophecy of Joel. One of the things I want to have you enter into this morning is this, that this prophecy of Joel would have had a different impact upon the ears of a Jew, and by the way, that was the original hearers, than it would have upon us 2,000 years later. The reason for, I believe, this different impact was because I think a first century Jew would have had more understanding of this prophecy than we would have. Most of us as believers have an understanding of the Old Testament but spend most of our time in the New Testament. They would have been steeped in this prophecy. They would have had a different perspective and understanding than we did. For Peter to tie in Joel's prophecy with the events that they had just seen, which I remind you were the rushing of wind, the fire, and this amazing language miracle, clearly was communicating to them from the mouth of Peter that the Messianic age was beginning. With all the details put aside of what Joel's prophecy was, a Jew hearing Peter say this would know that Peter is claiming that these events you just saw have just marked the fact that the Messianic age has begun. That's the last days phrase. The last days is the Messianic time. And the heart of a Jew would have leapt, and the ears of the Jew would have caught the fact that Peter just said that everything the prophets have foretold has come. Everything we have waited for. as it relates to Messiah, has arrived. Our Messiah has come. And all of that culminated in verse 21, when Peter, again quoting Joel, said, And it shall be that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. The word Lord to us means Jesus. To a Jew it wouldn't have meant Jesus. It just meant Adonai. Everyone who calls upon this Lord, this Messiah, whoever he is, will be saved. Now, the end of verse 21, where we left off last week, Whatever else has been accomplished by Peter in his preaching at this point, he at least, you can be sure, has their attention. Signs, wonders, the wind, the fire, the languages, and now this message of messianic fulfillment. He's got them listening. But along with what I think was probably eagerness and interest, there would have been a question in the mind of a Jew, and it would have been coming right out of verse 21. As soon as it would have come out of Peter's mouth, the question would have come, Peter, who is this Lord upon whom when I call I will be saved? What is his name? Who is this Messiah? Who is this wonderful source of hope? And Peter gives that in the text we're dealing with this morning in verse 22 when he says, men of Israel, let me answer that question. Listen to these words. It is Jesus the Nazarene. Stop right there. Now, I don't know this for a fact because it's not in the text, but I believe with all my heart that when Peter originally said the answer to that question, who is this Lord, and he gave it as being Jesus, the Nazarene, there very probably was in that group an audible groan. The Nazarene? You've got to be kidding. Note this. Many, many of the people who were here for the Feast of Pentecost, 50 days after Passover, we're there for Passover too. I remember this Jesus the Nazarene. I thought we got rid of him. We rejected him. We crucified him. We didn't want anything to do with him. I can't give me a break. Peter continues in this passage to say, yes, it is the Nazarene. That is exactly the one I'm talking about. But I want you to know right now that that one that you rejected and scorned and denied. God had a different opinion of him than you did. And you need to know that. In fact, this Jesus the Nazarene that you despised was affirmed to you, attested to you by God in a number of ways. Now get to the text. He was affirmed to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through him in your midst. You saw it all for three years. You yourselves know. This man, delivered up by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to the cross. Using the hands of godless men, he's speaking there of the Romans, you used them to do your dirty work and put him to death. You killed him, God raised him. Verse 24, God raised him up again, putting an end to the agony of death since it was impossible for him to be held in its power. Move down to verse 32. This Jesus God raised up again, to which we are all witnesses. Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he is the one who has poured forth all of these things you're seeing and hearing right now. This Pentecost experience. Verse 36, Therefore, let all of the house of Israel know for certain that God has made him, this Nazarene, both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified. And what we have here in these verses is, among other things, I believe a model for all New Testament preaching. It is preaching Jesus. Peter preaches Jesus. That is it. Paul picked up the same theme when he said to the Corinthians these words, We preach Christ. To the Jews, it is a stumbling block. To the Gentiles, Jesus, as our only hope, is foolishness. but to those who are called, to those who are being saved, that name of Jesus is the wisdom and the power of God. So we preach Jesus. Early in the week when I began to study this and see clearly what its theme would be, I felt moved by the fact that I stand before you and would stand before you this morning with what I feel is an inestimable privilege to stand in some sense where Peter stood later, where Paul stood, Now I stand there simply doing one thing. I'm going to preach Jesus. I'm going to preach Jesus today. I need to pray as we begin. Father, I call upon you for empowerment to do this. As I reflect on words that I am about to say that are mine, they're human, they're words that might make sense, they might confuse, they might be muddled. God, you know my heart. I want to exalt your son. My words can't do that. I pray that you would do that. I do think, Father, that you like it when we talk about your son. This might sound a little too earthy, but I want to brag about your son today. I want his name to shine. I pray that you would make it shine. and that those who love you already would be drawn in by the name even more encouraged and built and affirmed. And I pray, God, that those among us who may not regard that name as much, not in any way be beaten up by it, but, God, that they would somehow be compelled by you to consider this name, This Nazarene, a man considered by many to be of no account, who we believe is the king made both Lord and Christ. Do your work. In your name. Amen. I want to talk first of all of the designation that Peter, I think, on purpose uses when he speaks of Jesus, the Nazarene. There are many different designations that Peter could have used of Jesus. This one in particular is not his messianic title. Messianic titles are simply titles that speak of his deity, such as Jesus, who is the Christ, the anointed one. Jesus, who is the Son of God. Jesus, the Son of Man. This reference, Jesus the Nazarene, is common at best, connecting Jesus with his place of birth. But it is a term of derision and mockery at worst. At the worst. Pharisees often called Jesus the Nazarene in an effort to discredit him. In John 7, verse 52, the Pharisees, again speaking of Jesus, said, Look and see for yourself. Has anything of value ever come out of Nazareth? No prophet has ever come out of Nazareth. All you've got to tell me is that he's from Nazareth, and I know he's of no account. The inscription on the cross when Jesus died said this, Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews. And you and I, 2,000 years later, with a perception of Jesus of Nazareth, we don't have any tapes that play with that phrase. We kind of feel okay about that. A Jew walking by that cross with that inscription would have known the joke, Jesus the Nazarene, a king, give me a break. Nothing comes out of Nazareth. Peter, I believe in this message to Jews on this first day of empowerment, used that designation on purpose to recreate, as it were, a picture in their mind of the Nazarene, a person of whom they had a very clear opinion. I believe he's confronting them in an ironic way. I believe that he is trying to create a contrast between who these people thought this Nazarene was and who he really was. Everybody, men of Israel, listen to these words. The Nazarene. Remember him? You guys, remember him? Just 53 days ago, we saw him die on a cross. A pitiful victim. Remember the picture? Most of them could have. The last time they had seen him, he was indeed bleeding and swollen, a victim. Remember the game the soldiers were playing with him? he claimed to be a king and so they put a robe on him rammed a crown of thorns upon his head put a reed in his hand and pretended it was a scepter later on took the reed out of his hand and beat him on the head with his own scepter some king is he that lets himself be beaten on the head with his own scepter what a mockery and then they pretended to worship him and later blindfolded him and bumped him around from soldier to soldier spitting in his face and hitting him in the face with their fist saying prophesy to us oh king of the Jews which one of us hit you? Public opinion was pretty clear that day as to who this Jesus the Nazarene was. He was a fool. He was a loser. He was irrelevant. He was impotent. He was above all things no king. Peter, among other things, in this sermon as he starts, would have pricked the ears of these Jews, and they would have heard him say these things. I've got some news for you. God had a different opinion of this Nazarene than you did. You rejected him. God affirmed him. You killed him. God raised him. You despised him. God exalted him. You destroyed him. God made him both Lord and Christ. You guys were on the wrong end of this deal in your opinion. Second thing I want to point to after we look at just the name, the designation that Peter used here. It's very important for us to feel the power of this particular text. It's to know the audience that Peter is saying this to. It says at the beginning of that verse, it is the men of Israel, people of Israel. In verse 5, those people are described this way as being devout men from every nation under heaven. Devout men from every nation under heaven. You know what that means? That means that he is saying this to people who believed in God. They were devout. They had a sense of themselves as knowing who God was. In fact, above maybe the rest of the world, they really knew God. Isn't that good? Isn't that good? It would warm our hearts to know there's this mass of people in Jerusalem, and all of them are there because they believe in God. Oh, it's a good thing, isn't it? Let's take a poll 2,000 years later, 1991. Send it throughout the whole world. How many people in the world believe in God? Believe in some kind of God? How many? I think the poll would come back pretty high, and we would all be encouraged. We have a world that believes in God, some God. Seems like every six months or so, Gallup polls come out in the United States, and they tell us something to this effect. There's 80% to 90% of the people in America believe in God, and go to church or something. They at least believe in God. But they believe in God. And whenever that comes out, it just, huh, doesn't that just feel good? We really do live in a Christian nation. They believe in God. One month ago, December 17th, 1990, the Newsweek magazine had as its cover article these words, Young Americans Return to God. I read it, opened it up, and read that article and found out that it was speaking of baby boomers people basically my age were coming to the place in their careers and in their families where their children were just beginning to grow and felt like they needed some sort of stability and were coming back to God is what the article said. As I read it, something became very clear to me and I don't want to sound real testy, but it became very clear to me that the people they were talking about were not returning to God, but they were returning to church. Big difference. I want to soften that. I'm going to lighten up a little bit. I'm going to get a little testy. It may be, it may be. You know, as I was reading, I was saying, it may be that I'm a baby boomer. I really relate to baby boomers. Maybe I can communicate even to you. We are cynical about the same things, and we believe some of the same things. And it may be that our generation, my generation, has come to a point in our lives that we are seeking more, and we have sensed the vacuum, and we've figured out that the things we've been pursuing can't fill us. and maybe even the people that that article was capturing and trying to project something were indeed coming to a point where they were thinking maybe God is the answer. What I will not soften on as I read that article was this. At least the example of the churches that were being used in that article. What seemed clear to me in that article as it relates to those churches was that when those people in those articles were going to those particular churches, even if they were seeking God, it seemed to me when they came, they didn't get Jesus. They were not being given Jesus. Church after church, pastor and rabbi and whoever else it was who was projecting and all excited about all these people who were coming back, what they were getting was balloons and sentimentality and feel-good, consumer-friendly, yummy-in-your-tummy messages. They get what one pastor called the Quickie Bible. And our Quickie Bible is where we've dropped all the passages that aren't happy because we're the happy church. So we just kind of Quickie buy all the ones that are difficult and we just go to the happy ones. Church growth experts were quoted in that particular article with this quote. Church growth movement experts judge now that a minister's accountability is no longer his faithfulness to the gospel, but whether people keep coming and keep giving. The aim, therefore, of pastors is to figure out what it is that makes people come and makes people give and do that. And in the last days, people will want to have their ears tickled and there will be plenty of people that tickle their ears. So our aim is to accommodate people, find out what they want to hear, do that, and make them come. A particular pastor of a specific Baptist church in that article said this, Our priority in church is that what we want people to leave with when they come to our church is a smile and a handshake. Tried real hard not to get upset about that. As I thought about it, I thought this, here's the deal. I hope, I hope that when you come, if you're a visitor this morning, I hope that when you come here, by the time you leave, you get a smile. There's one for you. I'll give you one of all of you. There's one. There you go. I hope somewhere along the line you get a handshake. But I'm telling you this. If you leave our church with nothing more than a smile and a handshake, if you don't leave with some sense of being in the presence or hearing the name of Jesus as your only hope, you leave with nothing. Nothing. You can get smiles and handshakes a lot of places. But I'd like to think if there's a revival, it's because people are preaching the name of Jesus. Yes, the Nazarene, that one. Peter, in this text, in case you think I am, I like getting back to Peter, because this is what Peter says. You don't have to yell at me. Peter's the weirdo here. Peter, in this text, to a group of people who thought of themselves as knowing God, said this to them in essence. You guys claim to know God, you men of Israel, devout from every nation, but you have rejected, ignored, and denied Jesus the Nazarene. I am here to tell you this. If you do not know Jesus the Nazarene, you don't know God. to a Jew that would have been a very offensive statement 1991 to a Jew that would be a very offensive statement but that's an offensive statement to a lot of people a lot of people beyond a Jew some would hear that and say David David I came to this church because I heard you're kind of broad-minded and you fought a little bit broader and you had kind of a cosmopolitan view and kind of contemporary in your thinking somehow. You know, lighten up. This is irritatingly narrow. So many ways to get to God. In this age of enlightenment, I would think you would be in tune with that a little bit. Sometimes it's through crystals and other people, the stars and cosmic consciousness, and he is in us all somehow. Higher power. Jesus is one way. I admire your Jesus thing, but there are many, many ways. Disagree with me. Disagree with us as to whether Jesus is the only way or not. Never wonder what the Bible says, however. Never wonder what the heart of Peter is on this issue, however. Acts chapter 4, verse 12. Peter again preaching says, Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. We preach Jesus as our only hope. Jesus himself in John chapter 8, verse 42, speaking to people who thought they knew God, believed in God. Pharisees who were at that time saying, God is our father after all. Jesus said to them these words. If God were your father, it would have been so easy to tell. Because if God were your father, you would have loved me. Because if God alive were in you and you were bowing to him, he would have ministered to you the truth that I am his anointed. Jesus is the watershed. Jesus also said himself, I am the way, the truth, the life. No man comes to the Father but by me. It's Jesus. Yeah, the Nazarene. There's kind of an in-your-face thing. Yeah, remember him? What a grub. Remember him? What a no account. Remember a bleeding? Yeah, swollen. Remember? Victim on the cross. That one. And by the way, to this group who thought they knew God, what this was saying to them right out of the chute was this. In light of your perception of yourself that you know God, you need to know that God and you couldn't be further apart on this issue. Let me tell you what God thinks of this Nazarene. He was attested to. by God. Let me just define that word. It's very important. Attested to simply means to be affirmed by. He was affirmed by God. It means to be endorsed by. He was endorsed by God. It means to be approved, to be put on display. He was put on display by God. One of my favorites is that it means to be declared. He was declared by God to be the Messiah, to be the Christ, the anointed one. And God did that declaring in a number of ways. In this text, Peter reveals at least four ways in which God, with a megaphone, declared that Jesus, yes, the Nazarene, is the anointed one, the one we've always waited for, the Messiah. He did it, first of all, through miracles and wonders and signs, which you saw because it was in your midst. Now, when we study these things, it takes weeks. We kind of break it up. When these people were originally hearing it, it was all one event. And they are now in this verse listening to Peter because of what? Because of verse 6. When this sound occurred, the multitude came. They heard the wind. Remember that? They heard the wind in verse 2 and the mighty rushing wind caught their attention. And then they came and heard languages being spoken that they could understand of the mighty deeds of God and the reason Peter had enough credibility, at least at this moment, for them to even give an audience to was because they had experienced or heard the wind of God. Signs and wonders is what we called them two or three weeks ago. What I hear Peter saying here, among other things, is you guys, listen, the reason you're listening to me right now is because you heard the wind. What you need to understand is Jesus, the Nazarene, when he was in our midst, he did more than blow some wind in a room. We literally had the hurricane of God. The whirlwind of God was in our midst. His name was Jesus. The whirlwind was embodied in the miracles and the signs and the wonders that he saw, that did, and that you saw. He healed the sick. You saw that. He gave sight to blind eyes. You kept arguing with that guy about whether he was blind. Who made him see? He came to you and says, I don't know how this happened. I don't know who the person was, whether he was a prophet or not. All I know is once I was blind, now I see, deal with that. You saw that. Two days before you put him to trial, he raised Lazarus in Bethany. And you saw that. It wasn't a wind in a room, it was a hurricane of God. and when he was here in body you ignored that wind and part of my message to you now is this don't ignore the wind anymore it's what made you come and listen to this message don't ignore the wind anymore specifically in the text what peter is saying is this that these miracles and wonders and signs what they really were was God. Every time Jesus did a miracle, it was God saying, that's the one, that one right there is the worthy one. He is the beloved one. He is Messiah, Yeshua. He is our only hope. He is my son in whom I am well pleased. You ignored the wind. You rejected him, God affirmed him. There's another way he was affirmed by God as Messiah. Verse 23. God affirmed him, declared him to be the Christ by delivering him up to die, verse 23. Delivered him up by predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God to be nailed to a cross. Stop there and just respond to that on a very human level like I do. I hear that and I go, I don't get it. God endorsed him by delivering him up to die. Huh, I hope he never takes a shine to me. You know? I'm going to affirm you. Die. You know, whoa, what is this? You know what? We need to become a Jew. We need to think like a Jew for a moment here with some knowledge of the Old Testament. The Jews here with an overwhelming knowledge of the Old Testament would have known from their prophets. Now, I will allow for the fact that just like us as Christians, we hear teaching all the time and we forget most of what we hear. They forgot too. but it was part of their biblical heritage from the prophets that Messiah, whoever he was, the Christ, whoever he was, would suffer and die. That was not a new concept. Luke 24, 46, Jesus says, Thus it is written in the Scriptures that the Christ, whoever he is, should suffer and die. A question that would be good after that would be, well, you said thus it is written. Where is it written? Well, among other places, it's written in Isaiah 53. Isaiah 53, verse 3, he was despised, that is, Messiah, the one who is to come, forsaken of men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief like one from whom we hid our face. He was despised. We did not esteem him. He bore our griefs, our sorrows he carried. We esteemed him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. He was pierced through for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. The chastening for our well-being fell upon him. And by his stripes, by his scourgings, we have been healed. Verse 7, he was oppressed, afflicted. He did not open his mouth like a lamb. He was led to slaughter like a sheep that is silent before his shearers. He did not open his mouth. And in verse 10, all of this is prophetically speaking of Messiah, whoever he is, that he would suffer and die. Verse 10 then says, but God was pleased to crush him. was pleased to put him to grief. Why? Isaiah 53 goes on to say why. Because through this spotless lamb, forgiveness would come, redemption would come to all of Israel. Luke 24, 47 answers that question. Why was God pleased to crush him, to deliver him up? Luke 24, 47 says he was pleased to do that so that repentance for forgiveness of sin could be proclaimed in Jesus' name to all the nations beginning in Jerusalem and then around the world. When God, hear this, delivered Jesus up, it was literally the megaphone of God saying this, declaring this, affirming this. This Jesus, yes, the Nazarene, he is the worthy one. He is the holy one. He is the spotless one. He is the only one. This is the Lamb. This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye Him. Neither is there salvation in any other. For there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. We preach Jesus. Yes, the Nazarene. That Jesus. That Jesus is delivered up by predetermined plan as an affirmation that he was the worthy one. You nailed to a cross by the hands, using the hands of godless men and put him to death. I just want to touch on that a little bit. It seems like a paradox at best, a contradiction at worst, that God delivered him up and that was an affirmation to die. But they nailed him to a cross and that was bad. It sounds like they did the same thing. Both of them were dealing with Jesus in a way that dealt with his death. But I really think it's vital that we separate those things. When the people who surrounded the cross, and you might even be able to replay some of the teaching we had just a few months ago at the end of Matthew when we dealt with the cross, the crucifixion of Christ. The heart, the attitude, the spirit in the hearts of those people as they dealt with Jesus in terms of crucifixion was, Get him out of here! We despise him. We reject him. He is worthy of nothing but scorn. Nail him to a cross. Get him away from us. Different posture than God who delivered him up. It wasn't get him away. It was delivering him up because he is the worthy one, not the one worthy of scorn. He is not worthy. He is worthy of everything. But because he is the worthy one, I deliver him up. And then I hear verses like this. He who did not spare, that is God the Father, who did not spare his own son, but delivered him up for us all because of love for us. How much more would he lavish upon us, everything we need to those who ask? For God loved the world so much that he delivered up his son so that we could be redeemed. But God demonstrated his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died, he delivered up his son. Totally different thing. One of the affirmations of God, again connecting with the mind of a Jew that knew the Messiah, whoever he was, would suffer and die. One of the affirmations of God was that he delivered him up. And in the delivering, he is saying that is the worthy one, the holy one, the spotless one, that is the lamb, that is the only one. You killed him. God raised him, verse 24. God raised him. God raised him up again, putting an end to the agony of death. The word agony there is kind of interesting. It really caught my eyes. I captured it in the original Greek. Literally, what it means is birth pangs. And I thought, why didn't they put birth pangs there? I suppose it would have created some confusion, but it creates a tremendous picture of what's really happening when Jesus died. Jesus' death was birth pangs. What happens with birth pangs? What follows birth pangs? Hopefully. Life. a little baby life and I don't want to speak for women who always hate that when men do this but it was worth it you know it's like yeah well okay you should have a woman come in and do that piece you know but I think you'd say that and I hear Jesus saying for the joy set before him he endured the cross for the joy set before him he endured the agony of death the birth pangs of death because he knew that the agony the birth pangs of his death was going to yield life not just for him but for everyone who followed. He was the first fruits. And the first fruit speaks of a harvest to follow. And I'm that harvest and so are you if you're among the redeemed. Since it was impossible for him to be held in its power, Jesus wasn't killed by death. Jesus by death killed death. And then so very wisely to the ears of these Jewish people, he borrows the voice of David to bring his argument to fruition. It says in verse 25, For David, you guys, said of him, said of this Jesus the Nazarene. These words in Psalm 16 and verse 25 to 28 quotes this psalm, and as I read it, it's going to sound obscure. Just hang with me. David said this of Jesus, I was always beholding the Lord in my presence, for he, that is as if Jesus is speaking, he is at my right hand and I may not be shaken. Therefore, Jesus is saying, My heart was glad, my tongue exalted. Moreover, my flesh also will abide in hope, because thou wilt not abandon my soul to Hades, nor allow thy Holy One to undergo decay. Thou hast made known to me the ways of life. Thou wilt make me full of gladness with thy presence. The Jews listening to this would have known the psalm. They would not have known what Peter meant, how he was applying the psalm. So verse 29, Peter begins to explain, Brethren, I think I may confidently, say to you regarding the patriarch David whom we all revere that he that is David both died and was buried in fact his tomb is with us to this day we go there all the time for a Jew it was a shrine what he's saying there is this psalm is clearly speaking of someone who was raised from the dead. Whoever it was, you guys, who David was speaking of, he wasn't speaking of himself. Let's go on. And so, because he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat one of his descendants upon his throne. David was not to be the one raised from the dead, but David did get a promise. And the promise David got, because he was a prophet, from God was this, that from your descendants will come the king who will sit upon the throne. The Christ will come from you. Verse 31, he goes on to explain to this Jewish audience. He, that is David, looked ahead and spoke in this psalm of the resurrection of the Christ. Whoever that is, again, keep in mind there, we think of Jesus. He is just speaking of the generic sense, the anointed one. David was speaking of the Messiah that he was the one who would not be abandoned to Hades nor did his flesh suffer decay that he would be raised from the dead and I am here verse 32 to say to you that this Lord this Christ is Jesus yes the Nazarene Jesus verse 32 God raised up again to which we are all witnesses this Jesus who you rejected, ignored, denied, and killed, God raised. We all saw it. We saw him. We heard him. We touched him because God raised him. Eyewitnesses. Eyewitnesses. Last week, Sunday afternoon, I was in the car with my oldest son, Caleb. We were running in there and going to IGA or something like that for some junk food, I think. and I remember pulling out to the stop sign and he had this little twinkle in his eye as he often does and he looked at me and he said dad how do we know that there really is a God dad how do we know that the Bible is true how do we know dad that Peter wasn't lying and you know he ran these off one two three right after each other and I'm at the stop sign, and I looked over at him, and there's this little twinkle in his eye, and I could tell he was thoroughly enjoying watching me squirm over these questions. And I said something to him about the trees because of the trees. Nature. It's in nature. We talked about it for a long time, and I did. I tried not to give him pat little answers. I shared with him my struggle with some of those same questions, validated his questions. We just discussed it and talked about how it's okay to ask those questions because if God's really real, he's going to stand up to those questions, so that's okay to do that. Later on, I think it was that evening, he said in light of the same conversation, he said, Dad, you know, if this stuff really isn't true, we're in big trouble. you know i said people uh caleb i agree with you i agree with you you're absolutely right and that's part of the tension that it's good for you to struggle with and i didn't say this but i'm saying this now that's a great observation paul had the same observation first corinthians 15 14 he said this, if this stuff isn't true if God is not, if Christ is not raised here is the thing, we're in big trouble you see our preaching then is absolutely in vain and your faith is in vain and on top of that we are all false witnesses, we are liars no more of this stuff, Peter and Paul and these guys were wonderful people nice apostles, told everybody to be good if they are not telling the truth about Jesus being bodily raised from the dead they are liars Paul said that we are liars because we said God did raise him in fact Paul goes on to say this if Christ is not raised our faith is worthless we are all still in our sin those who died really are dead have never been raised never will be raised if we have hoped in Christ in this life only you're right Caleb we're in big trouble we are of all men most to be pitied but now Christ has been raised from the dead, Peter says, to which we are all witnesses. I saw it with my eye. Call me a liar if you want. I saw it with my eye. He rejected him and scorned him and crucified him. God affirmed him. God delivered him up because he was the spotless one. God raised him. Last thing, God exalted him. Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand, of the Father. And having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit. Remember that phrase, promise of the Holy Spirit? What was that? The sending of the Spirit for empowerment. He, He is the one who has poured forth these signs and wonders which you just saw and it's the reason you're listening to me now because you heard the wind. He, this Nazarene that you rejected, is the one who's pouring forth all of this, this Nazarene that you thought was of no account. You shouldn't believe me that he is exalted just because I said it. The proof that he is exalted is that all the things you just heard and all the things you just saw were generated by the Nazarene. The affirmed one, the delivered up one, the raised one, and now the exalted one. He is the one who poured all this forth. And as great as David was, he says in verse 34, and as much as we revere him, again, this is a clear message to a Jewish mind. As much as we revered David and honor him, it was not David who was ascended into heaven, but in fact, David himself said these words, the Lord, that is Yahweh, said to my Lord, that is Adonai, God said to the Christ, and Peter's identifying the Christ as Jesus the Nazarene, God said to him, only to him you sit at my right hand until I make thine enemies a footstool for thy feet. And then the culmination of it all, there's no way I can improve on this, verse 36, or add to this. Therefore, let all of the house of Israel know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified. I don't know why it's dawning on me more this service than the other two, but it really is interesting how the events of the Middle East right now put our attention on Israel. The songs we sang today really focused on that without a plan. We're not that organized. You know, the first time I preached this last night, again, for the first time in all my preparation, I thought I would love with the missiles that are dropping, I'd like something else to drop on Israel. I wouldn't like those missiles. I'd like this message to drop on them, for them to know that their Messiah has come. And yesterday during the worship, Zechariah 14 came to my mind, and Zechariah 14 says this, Israel is going to bow their knee to this Messiah. There is going to come a marvelous moving of the Spirit where Israel, God's chosen people, are going to see Jesus as their beloved son, their Messiah, who always was there for them, and they will be redeemed in a powerful, supernatural way. I don't know if you ever wonder why there is this odd kind of connection with Israel and with the Jews to the heart of a redeemed person. I'll tell you, I think it's a spiritual thing. I don't know how you feel about Jews. I don't know if you feel like it's a big joke and we tell jokes about that or if you feel anti-Semitic or where you would stand on that. But I want you to know that the people who have most impacted my life are Jews. Jesus is one. I spend all my time with Paul and Peter. So do you. Oh, no for certain. No for certain. Not only did God endorse the Nazarene, not only did he deliver him and raise him and exalt him, but he made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom we crucified. I close with this. We make appeals for people to accept Jesus, to receive him and believe him. The appeals vary, but often these appeals include promises. If you accept, receive, or believe Jesus, he'll make you happy, he'll make you healthy, He'll make you wealthy and wise. He'll solve all your problems. He'll fix your marriage. He'll make your life better. And, beloved, I don't want to scorn any of that. You know, so much of that is true. He lavishes his grace on us. He gives us life. One of the messages from this pulpit constantly is he is the only adequate source of life. And any other well you are drinking from is going to leave you thirsty. But there is a well that we can go to that gives water. And when we drink that water, we never thirst again. So he does nourish. There are incredible reasons positively to receive, accept, believe. But would you hear me in light of this text, in light of this last verse, where God's made them both Lord and Christ, that to the list of compelling reasons that maybe we need to accept and receive and believe this Nazarene, we would add this, because he is both Lord and Christ. That's why. And when I hear that as the compelling reason or one of the compelling reasons to accept or receive, accepting and receiving doesn't even seem to fit anymore when I recognize him as both Lord and Christ, being made by God, Lord and Christ. My impulse isn't so much to accept that doesn't work. My impulse is to bow. It's to bow to this Jesus. Yes, the Nazarene, that one of no account, that one, to him I bow. The response of these people who heard this sermon, we will deal with next week, verse 37 to 47. Our response? I don't know about our response. I can tell you my response from my heart is this. I choose to bow. And I can just imagine, it's almost like I can hear it. There's a screaming going up right now from you. And it's saying, don't you isolate us from this. Don't you say you're going to choose to bow because that's my heart too. And see, I think very possibly the response of us is that we, David, we choose to bow to this one that God made, both Lord and Christ. Why would we choose to bow? I'll tell you why. Because God affirmed him and God delivered him up and God raised him up and God exalted him and God made him both Lord and Christ and because of that we choose to bow. I want you to stand as we close. I want to pray before we sing it. Jesus, today through this text of Peter the attempt has been to lift your name up and you have said that when your name is lifted up you will draw men and women to yourself. Father, for those of us who already bow before your name, I pray that as we sing, it would be an affirmation of what already is true. And so it would sing and it would ring from our very being. We choose to bow, we choose to sing, we choose to crown you the King of Kings. But there are some, maybe many among us who never have in a personal way. They might sense they know God in some way. But the message here, very narrow, has been if they don't know Christ, the Christ, the Nazarene, they don't know God, never bowing their knee to Jesus. I pray in your name that you would release power right now, born of your spirit, that people, even as they sing, would maybe for the first time bow their knee to you as their king and on the spot where they stand enter into the family of God redeemed, made new, in relationship with you. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
