I asked Matt, and thank you, you guys, that was great, to do that, yeah. I asked Matt to do that for some godly reasons as well as some fleshly reasons. The fleshly ones is, wasn't that the day of rock and roll, huh? I mean, you know, some of the guys, the people in the band, they had to learn that tune, and, you know, you're looking at all these remasters, folks, that was the days. Summer of love, 67. It started trailing off in the 70s, but if you were privileged as a boomer to be there and you were tapping your foot today, you give special thank to God because what a time. But, you know, that's a fleshly reason. The spiritual reasons are two. One is I wanted you to kind of flash back to that time. Now, for some of you, it's just about bell-bottoms and tie-dyed shirts, you know, and retro. but for those of us who are back there, you remember there were songs like, come on people now, let's get together and try and love one another right now. Or remember that one, you'll help me with this, if you go to San Francisco, wear a flower in your hair. I mean, peace, love, and don't trust anybody over 30. Now those people who are over 30 are mayors, lobbyists, you know. They're in the game. And the problem with the change is, I mean, I think God was moving in our culture in a big way. But like anything, unless people really turn to God, they'll make their own way. And so love was about free love. Free of what? Free of God's law. Free of the reality of his love. And now if you go to San Francisco, wear some colors in your hair and wear black. Because the generation who received the fruit of the free love have brokenness. And there's groups like Stained, S-T-A-I-N-D. You know, listen to 93.x every once in a while. You know, 93.7x and hear what's going on. A lot of hopelessness, see. in our generation because that turning for change, but without God, Satan landed all over that. There were some good things that were hoped for, but it went the wrong direction. And without God and his love and his grace and the power of his spirit, we are hopeless. And the church is a place where we know about hope. And the church is a place where you not only know about forgiveness, but you know about change. And the church is the hope for this generation. And I believe that God's going to move again. Because this generation is at an end of themselves. And their hope is lost. And the only hope is Jesus. Right? So that's one reason. I want to talk about change. Turning. I like the word turning. Remember last time I was here we talked about turning. Right? Turning from God in pride. Turning back to God in repentance. The second reason is that it was not oh I forget the peace eater was not the writer of that song now he put his little tag at the end you know I swear it's not too late but you know who wrote that King David's son Solomon who we've been studying in the journey of the heart David and David was the one I talked about last time when I talked about the fact that in Psalm 131 which we're going to look at again in Psalm 130 David's heart was one that God loved because he continually turned back to God he turned away hard, but he continually turned back, and he made that the habit of his life, repenting and going back to God for his grace and his forgiveness, and I didn't get to tell you the other half of the story of turning, see, so I gotta tell you, now I'm not gonna tell you more of David's story, but I'm gonna talk about the story God wants to do in your and my life of repentance. One half is turning from sin to God for forgiveness, but then there's a turning to God for new life, and everything that sin was against everything God's for, and a change in our life now, a change now. So those are my two reasons for that, and I really want to talk about repentance. Now, that's a word that needs a little redeeming itself, because if you've been to the Metrodome, undoubtedly you've seen somebody there, repent, because God is sending you to hell, and the word repentance, unfortunately, in the theology that we've heard, the gospel we've heard, has not been given its full due. In fact, you don't even hear calls of salvation, really, you don't hear the call, repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. God has a wonderful plan for your life, believe. And that's half the package, forgiveness. It's half the package, it's half the grace. And forgiveness is incomplete unless it moves to this place of repentance for deep change, and not just deliverance from demons, but deliverance in the Old Testament sense of deliverance to a life of love and peace and shalom. A changed life. Now, repentance, I think, well, what is it? Well, there's two words, one in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament that tells repentance. It is this turning from sin and turning to God for forgiveness and for deliverance to a new life and for regeneration to a new life and sanctification and glorification to a new life. And the Old Testament word is the word shuv. S-H-U-V is the English alliteration of that. And shuv literally means if you're walking this way in sin, you take a 100, it's a return, a 180 degree turn back to God and into his life. We need a lot of shuv-ing in our lives. The New Testament word is metanoia, M-E-T-A, and then N-O-I-A is the English alliteration of that Greek word. which means to change your mind. So there it's talking about, again, a change of mind about sin, about God, about life. It's about a change of mind that moves from the heart, the mind and the heart, into the body, into our practice, into our very life that we live, into our relationships and into our world. So repentance is this wonderful thing, actually, that's had a bad name. And unfortunately, we think that repentance is for those who have just converted and you want to get away from that as fast as you can. And then it's for those who backslid, you know, if they fall hard, you know. And it's for those people, the 12-step people. You know, they need a lot of repentance to get over that stuff. You know, if you're one of those people, just we're all those people. If you're an American, you are just terribly addicted to noise, to activity, all kinds of stuff, and the only way to know it is to go to someplace like Haiti or Japan or China where that culture knows how to slow down. We don't have time for prayer and meditation because of that addiction. So those people is us, all right? Repentance, we need it all the way through our life, and it's a wonderful thing. Basically, the psalmist calls repentance in this psalm. Psalm 130 is just a picture of repentance. The person turns from the depths of sin, just having been there, and still the effects of it and the feelings of it, and turns, just doubting even God's forgiveness, but turns to God, sees the brightness of his face and remembers the deliverance that Israel has promised and that God did for them and was going to do for them and did for them in their own day, and he turns to forgiveness. But he also asks for this thing of deliverance from sin, Not just the penalty of it, but the power of it. So repentance is this wonderful thing. It's a great deal where God says, you give to me all your sin, and you give to me the death penalty of it, give to me the shame and the guilt, but give to me the experience of it, the disorderedness of it that's in your body, that's in your heart. You give me all those lusts, give me all those disordered desires, and I'm gonna give you heaven now. I'm gonna give you new desires, new behaviors, new relationships. What a deal, all at his expense on the cross. What a deal. Why are we afraid of that? Well, I'll tell you why we're afraid of it. If you don't like the word repentance, just change for good. Change for good, all right? Life changed for good. We're afraid of it for a few reasons. Change is tough, and we like to be comfortable. Now, have any of you ever gone through A remodeling of your kitchen, your living room. Wasn't it the best time in your marriage? You got so close. You didn't fight at all. See, renovation makes us uncomfortable. God's going to come in, and when we really are forgiven, not just let go of the death penalty, but the power of sin, God starts messing with our life, and we're not comfortable with that. Second reason we fear this change is because we really don't know any other way to live but in sin. So when it says taste and see that the Lord is good, you know, we've tasted sin. How would I get along without scaring myself all day, scaring myself to death by worrying about things? It's the only way I got to get going. But to trust, to believe, to have the energy in my day of expectation that God's going to move and he's going to take me through anything, wow, is that a better way to live? But we just don't know it. So we're afraid of it. We also, Satan's told us that, you know, the bad way is the good way and the good way is the bad way. He's got us messed up. He's got us messed up in our head. Change our mind about this stuff. You know, how could I get along without anger and control? How would I be able to make anybody in my life do anything? I'd have to trust God and them. So we just don't know any better. But we can be better. The third reason we fear it is because we believe, just like in renovation, if you've ever done it, you start getting in that plaster, which is a little soft, and you start tearing at that, and you go, this is all it's going to be, you know, just that. Oh, no. The wood's all rotted. and those electric wires are all, no wonder that we got a problem with electric, it's all corroded. The whole thing's gotta go. That's scary. The whole thing's gotta go. Psalmist says he brings full redemption from every sin. You see this whole body of flesh has gotta go. All the disorder's gotta go and it will go. But God wants you to begin now and don't be afraid of it. Now, a good image for repentance is fire. we've been taught to fear fire I was taught as a little kid not to put my hand on the stove weren't you? even mom might put it up there and touch it oh ouch when I was little about four or five little house we had in Chicago started to burn down and I'll never forget running out of that house with my parents we didn't have smoke detectors just smelled the smoke called the fire department and I could just see it as a little kid holding my dad's hand and here's all these firemen all around our house. That was scary. But you see, the fire of God's love, the fire of Christ's presence, the fire of the Trinity, which Jesus says lives within us, the Father comes and makes a home with us, John 14, 23, and he makes a living in us. He begins to renovate. The Trinity renovates your life. And we're just afraid that if he gets in there and he sees that the whole thing's gotta go, his love will fail us. His mercy won't be enough because in our sinful condition, we haven't grown enough to know how loving and forgiving he is. Let's look at the Psalms with that long introduction. I've got to stop here because Dave's wedding of his daughter is at four o'clock today and I don't want to be the main speaker on that thing. Psalm 130, Psalm 131. If you turn your Bibles, it's going to be up on the screen. This is a great Psalm. This is a Psalm that Luther prayed the night before he gave his confession, and he was afflicted with doubts and fears, and Satan began to tell him, oh, you're such a sinful person. How can you make this stand for grace and truth against the whole Roman Catholic Church? And he prayed this psalm over and over and over again. He was like a watchman through the night with this psalm. John Wesley was in St. Paul's Church in London, and God had been working in his life. We're a writer of many of our hymns in the start of the Methodist Church, bringer of revival to America. And he heard this psalm together with teaching Galatians, and he turned his life to Christ because God flooded him with his forgiveness and hope for a new life. It's a wonderful psalm. It's a psalm that's used in the Catholic Church and Lutheran churches during Lent. It's a psalm for change, a psalm for change, for repentance. So let's look at these two psalms. Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord. O Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy. If you, O Lord, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand? But with you there is forgiveness, therefore you are feared. I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, and in his word I put my hope. My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning. O Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for with the Lord is unfailing love, and with him is full redemption. he himself will redeem Israel from all their sins. Psalm 131. My heart is not proud, O Lord. My eyes are not haughty. I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me. But I have stilled and quieted my soul like a weaned child with its mother. Like a weaned child is my soul within me. O Israel, put your hope in the Lord both now and forevermore. Let's pray. Lord, as we look into this writer's experience that you, by the Holy Spirit, have caused to be written down for the ages for us to live in, Lord, we want to thank you that we can come now and we can wait on you in this song. We ask you to speak. We ask you to bring your fire. We ask you to come and light us up. Holy Spirit, come. Bring your repentance to us. We ask this in your name. Amen. well I want to tell you three things about this repentance this fire that if you walk into and if you're a Christian you've already walked into it you had to to be converted because even though it's not emphasized enough these days God only saves those who he can change it's heaven right and so if you've converted you probably also part of your conversion was turning away from some particular sin that represented all your sin, right? And God did a work in your life there. The trouble is, something came back, right? It came back. And maybe you hadn't been taught about how to deal in a lifetime way in repentance with your sin, to turn away from it and turn to God for change. It's not just about finding forgiveness, it's about finding the new life in Christ. So our first point is, and it comes right from this psalm, is that repentance is a lifelong, whole life process. It's a fire that burns from the first time the Holy Spirit gives you the hearing of the gospel and calls you to God and Jesus and he enters your life and the fire of the Spirit begins to glow in your heart and it burns like a coal all the way through until it's a raging fire and you go to heaven. Different concept. In fact, some writers have seen heaven as this fiery place of God's love. C.S. Lewis and others, and hell is more like this cold place where you're frozen. And the fire of God's love and his transformation, we don't have to fear because Jesus went through the fire of what? Our sin and our death and our shame and the penalty of it. And he died for that, but he also rose with a fire of resurrection power. And as we enter into this as a whole life process, my second point is going to be that you're going to find a deep, deep change beginning in your heart. Your desires begin to be turned as you begin to turn away from sin and take that to the cross. and then turn to Jesus in his resurrection life and power and person and look into his eyes and see his life and begin to have his life take over your life. Beautiful. And then you walk like that right on fire into heaven. Right into heaven. Glorification is being all lit up. That's what it is. In the fire of God's love. So this first point is very important to get, and it starts with forgiveness. Don't get me wrong here. We need to know and repent from our sin and turn to God for forgiveness. The psalmist, it's interesting here, the psalmist has both forgiveness of sin in the sense of the penalty of it and forgiveness in terms of release of the power of it and the experience of it, the deliverance from it to sin itself. Right in this psalm. And he doesn't stop with just forgiveness. He goes on to cry out for full redemption in his life and Israel's life. And he cries from the depths. you can almost see him here, out of his sin, he's forgotten his forgiving God, because he says, you think God has a hard time hearing us? He's going, Lord, you know, hear me. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? You know why you get that way? Because you fall back in sin, and you forget all God's face, and the shame, and all that stuff comes back. Now, that's not from God. That's from the enemy. The enemy wants to keep you from forgiveness and deliverance. So this psalmist, you just, you can memorize this and just use it to turn right out of sin. And he turns to God and he starts to look in his face and I think there's a lot of time between verses 1, 2, and 3, 4. And he looks to the Lord and he finally says, oh Lord, you know, you are a forgiver. You delivered us from Egypt. You told us not only that you're going to deliver us from the slavery, but you're going to make us our slaves to your righteousness and you're going to enter us into a land where we get to be slaves to everything good and beautiful. Oh, what a deal. What a deal. And you see this psalmist going for forgiveness. Now, it's very important to know you're forgiven. To know you're forgiven, because if you don't know that, you won't be able to move into deliverance. You've got to know you're forgiven, and you'll forget that. But you've got to know that to move into deep repentance. The Bible tells us, and the writer here says, God, you're not a keeper of sins. Now, some of us think of God as this person who's keeping track of your sins, you know, and he's, unfortunately, has to bow to his son, who died for you. The Father sent the Son. the fathers are forgiving God and the psalmist knew that and he had to be reminded of as he turned from his sin he turned to God he was constantly reminded of God's forgiveness how much does God want to forgive you and love you of your sin take the penalty of it and the death and the shame oh he wants you to be free of that and he'll continue to free you of it during your life it says in Micah 7.19 if we struggle with this matter of forgiveness which we talked about back with David but if you still struggle with it Micah 7.19 says I am the Lord I am full of compassion I will trample your sins, both the penalty of it and the power of it, under my feet. And I will cast them, both the penalty of it and the power of them and the experience of it, I will cast it to the depths of the sea. You know how deep the sea is? You get an idea how deep the sea is in its deepest parts? The tallest building, like one of them, is Sears Tower in Chicago. It's about 1,700 feet. You know what the newest, tallest building is going to be in the whole world? Freedom Towers. Beautiful, isn't that? Two towers are going to be replaced by this building, about 1,800 feet, 1,770 or so. but the sea is 35,000 feet deep in its deepest place in the Mariana trough in the South Pacific. Nobody can get down there but God and he ain't going there. You see, he isn't going to the place where he's throwing your sins. You don't have to worry about the death penalty but he also wants to throw the experience of it away. And he wants to lead you into new life. So it's a whole life process that entails forgiveness. It starts with forgiveness, but then it moves into deliverance. And if we don't have that movement in our life, moving into this fire of God to take and make us new and loving people, if we don't move from just receiving forgiveness to being made forgivers and lovers and people full of life, we're going to come up with counterfeit changes. Because, see, you're just made to change. And the enemy has all kinds of counterfeits, and your flesh has all kinds of counterfeits, and the world has all kinds of counterfeits. And the church, unfortunately, has taught some counterfeits. One of them is sin management. You've heard of anger management, keeping a lid on your anger? Because the Bible doesn't do anger management, it's anger mortification. Ten steps to keep a lid on things. Sin management is going to God for simply forgiveness and reminders of no death penalty, no hell, and to get away the shame and the guilt. Problem, if you do that, you'll probably move into sin management, which means you'll just go back and repeat those sins again and try to get back the good feeling of forgiveness, and the cross will remind you of forgiveness, but the cross will push you towards deliverance and healing and health and life. You just have to go there. But this sin management thing is so big. Just to illustrate it, when I was a kid, my dad had me mow the lawn. I had one way to mow the lawn. He had another. Okay? It was full of those dandelions. And his way was that he gave me, before I mowed with the mower, he gave me a little screwdriver, bent screwdriver. You ever seen these kind of torture tools, you know? And you had to get down on your knees, and you had to get down there, and you dug, you know what the roots of those dandelions are like? They're like strings. And he wanted you to get that whole thing out. You know what my way of mowing the lawn was? Even when they were to seed those dandelions, it was just taking that mower and going, Trouble was, without getting those dandelions out, we didn't have chemlon in those days. Praise God for chemlon. Without getting those dandelions out, I actually spread them. And when you go to God for forgiveness and not to full deliverance, I'm not talking about perfection here. We'll deal with that. That's another counterfeit. When you go to God for just that, you're just gonna get into a very tiring cycle. and what I want to tell you is the third point is that if you really move into this deep repentance it sounds like it's going to be really scary and oh a lot of work but it gets to be a rest for your soul it's very restful the counterfeits are striving that's called vampire spirituality sin management Dallas Wood is called that vampire spirituality those are people who suck on this is an icky image people who suck on the blood of Christ only for forgiveness of sins and not for a change of life I don't want that wraith-like existence in this life, do you? It's not the life of heaven. It's not what God pulls us into now. He wants to make us real and good and true and beautiful. So the second one is a golem kind of repentance. This is another counterfeit. And this is where instead of changing my life because I have no expectation for change, I don't know how to change, too scared of being changed, I may ask God to zap me a few times, go to a few conferences, or the next conference, kind of a camelon approach to the dandelions, and God will do that, but he will not keep you from getting on your knees in prayer and deep repentance. He may push you in with a conference. Today he might, but it's a daily practice. But some of us have been taught that what God wants is you to feel really bad. See, no change, but if you feel really bad, oh, what work is that? So forgive us. Confession is all about just feeling terrible about myself. And you know, the enemy loves that. It's not what God wants. Shame, guilt. It's great to get to the place where you can sin and go right to God and get happy. That's wonderful. You can actually get there. Now, the grief we have about sin, we'll see in a minute, is about the grief that we cause. There is a grieving, there is a sadness, and if you don't have that, something's wrong. But this isn't that kind of ungodly, worldly sorrow that is condemning, shaming, groveling, golem spirituality from the Lord of the Rings. All golem does is go from good feelings to bad feelings, talking about himself, looking at his record. You see, we're the record keepers, not God. And we keep the records on ourself. Instead of looking to his forgiveness, like he does, wants us to, and look into his eyes for forgiveness, we look at the record and we feel, oh my, oh, look, oh man. God doesn't care. He doesn't want you to cry over your record one bit. Cry over your sin. what you've done to others. Cry over grieving not having what he wants for you. But, you know, feelings, feeling bad, or feeling good, as the Pharisee does. Oh, you know, I've got a good record. Well, I think you'll probably set the bar down about here, the Pharisees do, and they shy on the outside of the cup and maybe do another counterfeit, which is, I feel good about myself because I have all these Christian cultural things that I do. I'm busy at church. I have lots of notes in my Bible, but no change has happened inside me. That's another counterfeit bumper sticker. Spirituality. God wants to take you deep. He wants to take you deep in a lifelong process. Now, how do you get deep? Well, this is going to sound really simple. Start praying and asking him to take you deep. An amazing thing might happen. All the things that you've been feeling bad about might not be where he wants to start. I had that happen to me and he pointed to something else and you know what that was a profoundest of that that didn't scare me because it was so real and true and there was a hope and a joy because I just knew it was him putting his finger on that that's true repentance see you can repent in this way and it'll affect your whole life but you see it's not easy I'd like to change because God's going to get in there and he's going to mess with you alright there's been an approach to the Christian life that doesn't want to go deep and it's this and God's used it to save people but God has a wonderful plan for your life you know the four laws I want to reduce mine to one God has a wonderful plan for your life he's going to give you all of your sins but he's going to mess you up real good he's going to mess with you real good he's going to make a home in you he's going to turn your life around he's going to renovate you and he wants to go deep. Let me give you some noticings about going deep. The first noticing around this is that when we go deep with him, we need to get a picture and he will begin to give us a picture of what it is to obey him in that area. That's a wonderful thing. Remember, I talked about anger control. What would it be like to obey him in sexuality and no intimacy and not have all that junk? See, what God wants to do in repentance, turn you from the sin. Most of us are being defeated because we turn from the sin but we have nothing to turn to. Now we turn to God for forgiveness. We don't have nothing to turn to. And in sexual sin you get a picture of what it would be like to have your body be in control, God's control, and be a holy instrument of the Holy Spirit and be able to use your touch and your eyes to be intimate. And that'll involve sexuality when it's redeemed again. But it's a way different thing, right? it's not death, it's life so get a good picture, ask God for a good picture ask him where he wants to work, ask him for a good picture Jesus for a good picture of what it is and then know that you're going to deeply grieve you will grieve because that's the part of Dave talked about being in a cave this vessel of clay we're in is a cave that you'll be in for the rest of your life now Paul said, you know, it's tough living in a cave that cave 2 Corinthians 4 he said man it's hard living in this cave it's dying daily it's wasting away and yet and he participated in killing that mortifying those sins he talks about that putting off putting on warring for your mind and your body there's all sorts of images of repentance in the scriptures that if we read the scriptures with this in mind we'd see him being a soldier who's on duty a watchman who's waiting for the morning. You know, being a watchman's a busy thing. If you're out there like this person was, you're watching for the enemy at that third watch of the night when the dawn's coming because that's when they may attack. And you're very watchful for the enemy. You're praying for God and his light to come. See? Waiting, watching. And so, but there's gonna be some grieving in this process but also some joy. And the grieving is going to be about the fact that you're letting go of the sin. And God has brought to me deep times of crying over areas in my life, and it was not a golem thing, you know. It was sweet. I just, oh, Lord, let the tears keep coming. There were tears of joy and grief. The next thing you need to notice is that things are going to get a whole lot worse before they get better, and they're going to continue to get worse in some ways, but continue to get better until you're glorified. when you begin to work in an area because we've been doing this probably doing these counterfeits and putting a lid on things like if you want to try and take care of your anger and you're going to make your stumbling attempts and you're going to try real hard Lord God I'm praying about this anger and I'm going to move into this and I've got some disciplines around that that I'm going to do I'm moving into this but it's got to be a supernatural change this is just this deep work is a supernatural change this is no work of you but you enter into it and you know what you're going to find you'd put a lid on it and that junk is a lot deeper than what you knew when you start to get it to God. That's frustrating. You feel like you're gonna go down. You thought you needed grace and forgiveness before? When you do this work, you're gonna need all the grace that God has, and he wants to give to you. But it is gonna get better, because you'll notice the joy of your desire. God is gonna take and move in your heart, and he's gonna make it happen in his power. It's going to take all your effort. That's the next thing to notice. This is a supernatural change that requires God's supernatural. And all we do is place ourselves before him through disciplines, through prayer, longing like the watchman in Psalm 130 for his full redemption, knowing and claiming our forgiveness, but wanting the full deal. And God will begin. Supernaturally, you all of a sudden notice, you know, it's different. What is that? It's God. It's God. Now, there are things you need to do. You know, if you have a problem with enemies and you hate people, start praying for them. You gotta get on your knees, you gotta dig out the dandelions. You pray for somebody who's your enemy, who you hate, and I guarantee you, if you pray to bless them, you will be showered with God's love for you and for them, and you'll be able to bless enemies. Wow. But it's gonna take everything you got. Dallas Willard says that if you begin to work into this, let me ask you this, who do you think needs more grace and forgiveness from God? The person who's keeping a lid on it and just asking for, you know, reminding themselves that they're saved from hell and getting rid of the guilt and shame or the person who's digging out the dandelion? The mower or the digger? Who has more grace? Who needs more grace? The digger. They need grace like a 747 needs jet fuel. Like the space shuttle needs that high octane, whatever that stuff is. I'm probably wrong there. But you need a lot of grace. You're forgiven, but you're going to need grace, supernatural power to change you. And you know, when that happens, you'll begin to see some things. You're gonna move from thinking about yourself like a golem spirituality and repentance to your repentance is gonna be all about how can I love others? Oh, Lord. You become like the guy in Schindler's List. Oh, this thing in my life, if I'd have given that sin to you, you could have done this with it. And you begin to think of others, see? You begin to have God's heart. And then you'll begin to learn to endure. Now Satan has no problem with those who are doing sin management. He leaves them all alone because they're nicely tucked away. They may be going to heaven, but they're not going to do any damage for the kingdom because they're expecting no change. But those who move into this kind of repentance, he's working on all the time. He doesn't want you. He's going to try and cut that fuel line to that 747 project. He's going to try and crash that plane. He's going to do whatever he can. so you're going to need to move through. You may begin to get some attacks, life difficulties, anything. Satan's just trying, you know what he's trying to get you to do? Keep on, stop, stop, stop. Don't do that turning thing. Don't do that turning thing. And he's going to make it tough. But if you press through that, the word, if you go through the passage of Scripture that talk about God has given us his grace, and that moves into faith and forgiveness, and that moves into endurance, long-suffering. The word is hupomene, to remain through. He will give you the grace to remain through, and you'll need a lot of grace for that to get to character, but that's the last thing. You will get to character. What a joy that is. You know who the people are who are most, that's my third point, you know the people, because I got close, you know who the people are who are most assured of heaven? It is the people who have begun to taste heaven and live in it now. See? If you've been to France and you've spoke a little French, you don't have to go to a French restaurant to learn about France, right? If you begin to taste the good things that God wants to do in your life, even though you're wasting away and finding all kinds of other places, and it's going to happen until, you know, you just need the grace of God to glorify and take you home, and you give up the ghost. But once you've tasted that good stuff, there's a rest that comes in your soul, and you start to move into Psalm 131. I love that psalm. It's a very restful place because it has this image. David has turned to God for forgiveness, but now he's learning to turn from the temptation. He still falls. He fell hard, right? Remember at the end of his life, that counting the troops thing, he fell hard, but he had been a turner. He had learned to turn from that and turn to the Lord, and his heart was now turned. And if you keep turning to him, you may fall hard. Your record might not look like what you want it to be and Satan will, you know, but God knows your heart and your heart's turned and it's his and you've tasted heaven and you're going there and you can rest. There's a rest for your soul. And in fact, David writes in Psalm 16, I have set the Lord always before me. Therefore, I will never fall. Now, it doesn't mean he'll never sin. He did sin. What it means is he'll never fall away completely because if you keep turning to God, you can't fall away. You get it? You just can't. you can have an assurance that you won't fall away from him completely if you just keep coming back. The thief on the cross, he got a little late, but he got it, right? He's on the cross, and he's spitting at Jesus, and he's swearing at Jesus. He's not getting mad. He's not spitting back at me. He's praying for me. And he heard forgiveness. Father, forgive him. Forgive him. Forgive that guy. And his heart started to go where? From sin to something over here. He didn't even know what it was. He didn't ask to go to heaven. You know what he asked him? Jesus, I don't know what your thing is about, but if that's what it is right there, will you remember me when we are done here? He got heaven. He got character real quick. He got a taste of it. And when he died, because he turned to him, And his heart was, when he was dying, he was like this. His eyes were on God. He got a hand. Boom. It was that guy. It was a nail scarred hand who he'd just been with, who reached down, pulled him right into heaven. That's the fire that'll take you right there, folks. Repentance turning. It's a fire that'll get you there. You know, when I go home, I got my two children are sitting here now, Kyle and Kara, my wife Sherry. We're empty nesters now. Praise God. Don't take offense, you guys. but they're home now, and I love it that they're home. But now Sherry and I, you know, we're in this place, we've turned to each other so often that we have got what we call a great love. You can get a great love with God. There are times in our marriages where we weren't turning. You know, in marriage, one person's here, one person, you're rarely in the same place. So we're always praying for each other. And I remember one time I was praying for her, and God would just bring a romance to us. And I said, God, so this is what you do. Ask God what to do. Get a good picture, right? And I said, God, what should I do? He says, write romantic cards to her. Oh, yeah. You mean the things I did in dating I can do when I'm married? Yeah, yeah, Keith, yeah. So I go to the Hallmark store and I started getting these romantic cards and I started mailing them to her junior high and I put on the corner, what we learned from C.S. Lewis was, I put a great old lover because I wanted a great old love. You know, anybody can have a great young love. That's what, oh, all the Romantic songs are all about great young love. You do this for me, and you do that for me, and you make me feel that way and this way. Christian marriage is about a great old love where you begin to, I want to serve you. And I'm going to bless you when you're my enemy because you just yelled at me. I'm going to bless you and us. I'm turning towards you. And you'll get a great old love like that. Well, you know, I sent these cards. The unfortunate thing was, because there was no address in my name on it, all the secretaries, and Sherry found this out, and we haven't confronted it yet, they think that she's having an affair with somebody. Folks, you can have an affair with God. It's called Christian maturity. It's called deep repentance. It's called deep character. Are you hungry for that fire? All you gotta do is look at his eyes. I refer to these three because when these kids were home, I came home, and at the end of the day, I wanted to see three sets of eyes. If they were gonna be out, I wanted to know about it. They had to call in. My wife and I call in and check in. If I don't see those eyes, I get up in the morning, I want to see the eyes, right? Every day, God's looking for your eyes. And that's the turn you've got to make every day. Turn from sin. Turn from this treasure to, turn to the treasure from the clay. Turn to him. And what the Bible says about assurance of heaven is that you can be at peace with him when you die because you've turned so often. You can even die a scary death. In fact, I talked to somebody the other day who almost did a semi, and they thought they were always worried about their death. And all of a sudden, this peace rushed over them because of their prayers. that they'd always made every day. Look to his eyes, turn to Jesus. He's gonna start a fire. He's gonna mess you up really good. Thank you.
