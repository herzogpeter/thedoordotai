The Trinity is not picturable. You can't picture the Trinity. But God is picturable in the place where God gives himself to be pictured, namely, in the person of Jesus Christ. Look, we can't even conceive, we can't picture how light is wave-like and particle-like. In fact, in no really significant theory dealing with quantum physics or quantum mechanics, can you ever picture what they're talking about. That's one of the first things you learn when you get involved in physics is to put aside the idea that you have to be able to picture something to make sense out of it. Because when they talk about photons and electrons and fields of energy, these are things that are utterly unpicturable. You can't get a picture of it in your mind. The best you can do is put it into a mathematical equation. so also with God we can't picture the Trinity but that's not to say that God can't in any sense be pictured he gives us a place where he can be pictured and the place is Jesus Christ that's why Jesus says if you see me you see the Father why then do you ask show us the Father Philip says show us the Father and no doubt he thought he'd see the Father standing alongside the Son as though the Father were finite and the Son were finite but But Jesus says, what do you mean? Have I been so long with you and yet you don't know me? If you see me, you see the Father. Why then do you ask? Show us the Father. Gee, I thought I was growing. What else was I going to say here? Oh, this is why the Bible calls Jesus Christ the Word of God. The Logos, Tuthayu. The Word being the place where God is expressed. In Hebraic thought, in Semitic thought, your word is what expresses your character. God has a word. He doesn't have three words. He has a word, and the word is Jesus Christ. You want to know where God is expressed? He's expressed in the person of Jesus Christ. That's why Jesus Christ is called, even before his birth, the image of God. There's a place where you can image God. There's a place where God makes himself revealable, and that is in Jesus Christ. He's called the expression of God, Hebrews 1.3. There's not three expressions of God. There's not three incarnations of God. There's not three bodies to God. There's one. And that is in the person of Jesus Christ. This is also why the Bible says, No one has seen God at any time, but the only begotten Son, He has revealed Him. John 1.18 Where can you find out what God is like? You look to the person of Jesus Christ. The early creeds were simply trying to have a doctrine that preserved that truth. It wasn't that you could picture three different beings up in heaven. There's only one place where you can picture God, and that's in the person of Jesus Christ. And some Christian art butchers that by trying to paint the Trinity. And you come up with these monstrosities. You look at the paintings of the Middle Ages. You have one person with three heads. Or sometimes you have three people that their bodies are connected. And a lot of weird pictures like that. And they mean well, and they're sincere. And if you know better, they won't lead you astray. But on the other hand, that can lead towards tritheism. Sometimes people have this question. Doesn't the Bible say that Jesus is seated at the right hand of the Father? And so it seems as though you can picture the Father and his right hand is Jesus Christ, and presumably at the left hand is the Holy Spirit, though people aren't usually inclined to try to picture the Holy Spirit. But the phrase, the right hand of God, isn't a phrase about location, As though what Stephen was really interested in just before he got stoned in Acts 7 was telling everybody where exactly Jesus Christ was located relative to the Father. If you take that literally, it assumes that the Father is finite, and he's literally got a right hand. But if you look up in your concordance, all the phrases, all the instances where the right hand is spoken about, and there's over a hundred of them, the right hand of God or the strong arm of God, it was a synonym for the power or glory of God. That was a Hebraic way of saying God's power. We still speak about that. Give me your right hand, your strong arm. It was just a way of speaking. So it's not to be taken too literally. What Stephen saw was Jesus Christ in the glory of God, being glorified in God at the right hand of God, showing forth his power and his glory. Let's take questions about this, and then we'll move in and talk about the significance of it, if there are any questions about it. What's going through your head? Talk to me. What's going through your minds? Any questions? Why did Jesus Christ have to be resurrected before he could send the Holy Spirit? Anyone got an answer for that? I don't know. I should think about that more, shouldn't I? He did say that, I mean, he made it clear that, he said explicitly, you should be happy that I go, because when I go, I'm going to send the Holy Spirit to you. I can't give the Holy Spirit now because I've not yet ascended to the Father. And so there's a reason for that. But, you know, what God's psychology was on that issue, I don't know. Do you have any inclination? If we could explain everything, then we'd be good. Or we'd be equivalent. Yeah, well, no one would try to explain everything, but it'd be nice to... There might be an important point in that. I mean, there might be an important point in that. It might have something, and having said that you're glad I don't have an explanation, I feel more motivation to come up with one. It's my bad boy image. I'm always trying to cause mischief. But the main job of the Holy Spirit is to point us to Jesus Christ. He says that. That's why he sent the Holy Spirit. He opens up our hearts so we can see Jesus for who he really is. So the Holy Spirit points us to Jesus Christ. And it may be that until the resurrection, who Jesus was was yet a concealed question. It was only after his ascension that we really see Christ as the glorified Son of God. Up to that point, it had been kind of ambiguous. Now it's very clear. It's not how the Holy Spirit points this to him. But maybe, you know, that's just... The other thing is that the passage is a little bit strange because we knew the Holy Spirit was working before that point. John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit. Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit. People in the Old Testament were filled with the Holy Spirit. So it wasn't as though the Holy Spirit wasn't around at all until Jesus ascended. He apparently is talking about the Holy Spirit in a new dimension, talking about a new work that the Holy Spirit's going to do. And that begins on the day of Pentecost with the birth of the church. It just fits into God's providence. Don't ask nosy questions. No, it was a really good question. Yes. I think that's a very good analogy, frankly. It's much better than most analogies. But I think, in fact, throughout church history, you have people looking at the human person as the best analogy for the Trinity. St. Augustine was the one who really got this thing going in the 5th and 6th centuries. He says this, that as we are bodies, we're also intellect, and we're also spirit, heart, emotions. And yet we're one person. So also, God is one God, but with three different dimensions, three different aspects or whatever. But it's not three gods. Another analogy that I really like a lot, because I think it fits biblical terminology the best, It has to do with this. All of us in our inner self, we are a self, but all of us have a self-image, a way that we relate to ourself. And all of us have a relationship with that self-image. You either love yourself or you hate yourself or you're kind of ambivalent about yourself. All of us have, we're a self, but we see ourselves as something and we also have a relationship with that. Every time you think, you have really your self-image talking to you. That's what thought is. There's a multiplicity within the human person. Without that multiplicity, we could never be persons. You could never think unless there was a multiplicity within your own psyche. And some have suggested that, Jonathan Edwards suggested this, that that is the best analogy for the way God is. The Father is God's innermost heart, the soul of God, so to speak. Jesus Christ is the image of the Father, the way the Father thinks about himself, so to speak. But not just like an idea, but he's a real person, but he is the expressed image of the Father. Hebrews 1, 2 tells us that. And the Holy Spirit is the relationship between the two. Take away any one of those and you wouldn't have God. There's just three different ways that God is God. Part of what's wonderful about that analogy is this. If that's true, if Jesus Christ is the way God, that is the way God sees himself, understands himself, loves himself, then two things follow from that. The first is that when you see Jesus Christ on the cross, this tells you something about God's self-image. It's as though he were saying, I am so in love with these people, I don't want to be God apart from them. I understand myself to be the kind of God who would die for them, to incorporate them into my own self-love. So you see the real essence of God as you look at Jesus. This is how God understands himself on the cross. I think it really does something beautiful to it. The other thing, though, is if you press that analogy very far, you get the understanding that if the Holy Spirit is in us, producing us a love for Jesus Christ, we are partakers of God's own self-love. God gives us something of his own love for himself when he gives his love to us. In the same way that if I love you, and we have time to develop it, I let you in on part of my self-relationship. You become a participant in the way I understand myself. You never become me, but you become included in the way I love myself or in the way I hate myself or what have you. People whom we love, we open up our self-image to, and they become a part of our self-image, our relationship to ourself. So also I think, 1 Peter 1.4 tells us that we are participants in the divine nature. I don't think that ever means we become God or anything like it, but we do participate in the way God relates to himself. John 17, 25 through 28 tells us this. Jesus says, Father, I pray that they may be one in us, even as we are one. And this is also where Paul says in Ephesians 1, 4, I like when you ask questions. I hope you're getting all this. In Ephesians 1, 4, you guys, this is the most incredible truth in the world. Just get this. Get this. Hebrews 1, 4, Paul says that we are beloved before God in the beloved. We are loved, we are rendered lovable and blameless before God and the Beloved, clearly referring to Jesus Christ. And what you get here is this. We are incorporated into Jesus Christ. We're put into him. It's sort of like if I have a container. I don't have a container, but if you have a glass, you pour water in the glass. To look at the water, you've got to look through the glass. That's how God relates to us. He pours us into Jesus Christ, and now when he looks at us, He sees us with the very righteousness, the very holiness of Jesus Christ. He sees us and relates to us only as we are in Jesus Christ. We become a part of his self-image. He gives us his righteousness. Didn't seem to wake you up any, but it gets me woken up. Hey, go ahead. Well, both. Yeah, he shares his love with you. And I think it's a reciprocal thing. And it's this way in human relationships, too. He tells you what he thinks about you. That helps you understand who you are. It helps you think about you. And out of that self-love comes a love towards God. And the more you understand how he loves you, the more you love yourself, the more you love back to God. And it's this reciprocal kind of thing. I really believe that the more we love God, the more we love ourselves. The more we love ourselves, the more we love God. And it's not an either-or kind of thing. Other questions about the Trinity that we've discussed so far? Either I'm very clear or I'm very opaque. Very clear or I'm so unclear you don't know what to ask about. I hope it's not the latter. Here's the significance. Is this just a weird abstract doctrine that someone hammered out in mathematics in the Middle Ages or something? No. It's a very significant doctrine. Here's the thrust of the doctrine of the Trinity. It's not a mathematical puzzle. One more footnote. If someone, you know, if you're talking with someone and they say, you know, a lot of people, a lot of people even who go to this church say something like this, there's no people who just don't believe in the Trinity. They're kind of all around. You know, you don't just find them in little weird cults. They're all over the place. But they say, you know, the Trinity is impossible. You believe in three gods. You know, it's an absurdity. just say, are you saying that it's impossible for God to exist three different ways at the same time? See, that doesn't sound so offensive, does it? That's all we're saying. God exists fully and personally in three different ways. Are you saying God can't do that? It seems kind of arrogant to say, no, God can only exist in one way, and I'll tell you which way. It really should not be as offensive a doctrine as it is. A lot of the reason why some groups want to deny the Trinity is because they think that what the Trinity is saying is that there's three people in heaven. They have that misunderstanding. And so that leads them to want to say, well, that can't be true, so the doctrine of the Trinity isn't true. What we need to show them is that that's not what the doctrine of the Trinity says. That's an abuse of the doctrine of the Trinity. That's not the doctrine of the Trinity itself. We're just saying God exists, and we can't picture it. I think we're better off if we just say it. Well, we can't picture it. We can't explain it either. But we can't explain light, so what's the big deal? Significance of the Trinity. First of all, the main point that the doctrine of the Trinity wants to affirm is the truth that the Son is God and the Spirit is God. Against all groups that would try to subordinate the Son and the Spirit to the Father, the Orthodox Church has always said, No, they are one with God. It was kind of like this. Do you think of it like this? Father, Son, and Spirit. Or do you think of it like this? Father, Son, and Spirit. And by this you mean that there's a subordination there. As though the cutoff line for being God was with the Father. Or is the cutoff line below the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. A number of groups wanted to say only the Father is God, the Son is created, and the Holy Spirit's just sort of, some thought it was an angel, some thought it was just sort of like the Jehovah Witnesses say he's the laser beam of God or just sort of the influence of God, but not God in any full sense of the term. The church wants to say this, you're dealing with one God when you deal with the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. So the main thrust of it, the doctrine of the Trinity is simply a way, a succinct way of saying we believe that when we look at the Son, we see God, and when we think about the Spirit, we think about God. that's really all it comes to mean oh look at this Christ is God to us it also has this significance it means that Christ is deserving of worship and we'll see this shortly maybe that if in Jesus Christ we are dealing with God himself then Christ is deserving of worship we worship God truly when we worship the Son of God he's the object of our devotion He's the center of our faith. Jesus Christ is the place where God gives himself to be known, where God gives himself to be loved, where God gives himself to be worshipped. That's the center of our faith. If you think that Jesus Christ is something else, then you can't possibly worship him. Which means you have to worship what? Something you know not what? Some idea of God or something or other. An abstract concept. But in the person of Jesus Christ, we have the place where God gives himself to be worshipped. That's why Jesus accepted worship. He says in John 5.23, a very good verse to note, I've come that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. Honor the Son even as... If an angel said that, let him be anathema. An angel has no right to say that. It also in 1 John says that no one has the Father except he who has the Son. and he who has the Son has the Father already. That's a good verse. No one has the Father except he who has the Son, the place where the Father gives himself to be worshipped. And he who has the Son has the Father already. There's not a second thing you have to get. A second thing, a second practical significant point about the doctrine of the Trinity is that God's whole self is involved in salvation. God's whole self is involved in salvation. Maybe it's good to contrast the Christian view of salvation with, let's say, the view of the Muslims. In Islamic theology, God, Allah, is up here, and you are down here. And the way you're saved is that God tells you what to do, and you do it. It's basically what, but God stays up here. In fact, in Judaism, it's a little more refined. They have a God who can also dwell within. But it's still very much a God who's up here. And the way you communicate is sort of a long-distance phone call. That's not doing justice to it. But I want to emphasize the point that there's a distance here. There's a distance here. And the main way that we are saved is by God telling us things and us doing them. It's a behavior sort of thing. Some Christians, unfortunately, have this view of God, too. What it's really about is obeying commands. And to the degree that you have that view of God, there's one immediate consequence. If the whole business, if what this whole thing is about is God telling me what to do, me doing it, and then God being happy. God's happy when I do it, and God is sad when I don't... Oh, this is blasphemous. God's sad when I don't do it, or rather, no, he's not sad, he's angry. Then, you see, what's going on is that God isn't in love with you as you are. What God's in love with is behavior. And if you do the right behavior, God loves you. If you don't do the right behavior, God is mad at you. He's going to send you to eternal hell. So what God is really about is behavior. If you happen to be attached to the right behavior, you're in. If you happen to be attached to the wrong behavior, you're out. But what would you think about growing up in a home where your parents treated you like that? you never would feel loved even when you did the good behavior. Because it's very clear to you that what was loved was not you, but the behavior. I score a touchdown, my dad is happy. Well, what he's really happy at is the touchdown, not me, because if you take away the touchdown, I could be gone. I'm not saying that that's exactly what my father related to me, but there are homes where that happens. And to a certain degree, it was true of my own. Okay, in contrast to that, the doctrine of the Trinity spells out the way God relates to us. And this is what I think is so important about it. It's really a summary statement about how God saves us. I said you can't picture the Trinity, and you can't. But you can't, just like with fields of energy, you can come up with mathematical equations. Well, this is sort of a mathematical symbol of the Trinity, all right? Take up what it's worth. I call it the figure eight. The figure eight model of the Trinity. Well, okay. It's not meant to be that. Hey people, you should see this. They're all laughing at me. The figure eight model of the Trinity. And what I'm getting at here is this. Why is so funny about that? I'm glad my identity is not in my drawing ability. I'd be crushed right now. It's a mathematical symbol. It's better than medieval art. Okay, look it. Here's what I'm trying to symbolize. In the Christian view of things, God, in and of himself, the God who was transcended, impossible to see, beyond all comprehension, comes to us. Follow these arrows here. See this arrow? He comes to us in the person of the Son, Jesus Christ, and centrally revealed in the cross. Jesus Christ is the image of God, the picture of God, the form of God, Hebrews 2, the expression of God, the Word of God. He comes to us. He becomes a man. The word of God, the word God is expressed is now in a human person. He comes to us. But that is, it doesn't stop there, because if he didn't do a work in our hearts, we never would have known it. We never would know that God became incarnate. We're so unregenerate. Our hearts are dark. Our hearts are desperately wicked. So he goes further, and he regenerates our hearts. This is the church here, by the way. Looks like the Red Cross. He comes to the Red Cross. He works in the cross. I mean, he works in the Red Cross. He works in the church. Okay, I'm starting a new cult, the cult with the Red Cross. He works in the church, which is us individually and us corporately. And picture a current here. This is like a picture of a river running in a figure eight. I know it's physically impossible, but just picture it. There's a current here, a flow. God comes to us. The Father comes to us in the Son. He regenerates our hearts, infuses us with a love for Jesus Christ, and as it were, catches us up in this current and brings us back and places us in the Son, where we're now rendered blameless and spotless in God's sight, and that renders us compatible with the Father. It's sort of like this. God, the way I picture the Trinity, insofar as he becomes revealed to us, is that the Father reaches down to us through the doorway of the Son, grabs us in the Holy Spirit, and brings us back to himself. But the whole Godhead is involved here. It's not God standing way up there saying, hey, you will obey my commands. He comes down himself, fully God in the man Jesus Christ, and fully God dwelling within us to pull us back to himself. We get caught up, as it were, in this current. This is also where what we said earlier about Jesus Christ being the self-image of God becomes important. Because this whole movement in some way reflects the way God is eternally. God didn't just start being triune with the creation of the world or with salvation. He eternally is this way, but he unveils himself to us as he redeems us. The Father coming to us in the person of the Son, grabbing us in the power of the Holy Spirit, bringing us back, recognizing the Son, entering into a relationship with the Son, and thereby rendering us compatible with the Father. Ephesians 2.18 I put down there as an example text. There Paul says, For through him, Jesus Christ, we all have access to the Father in one spirit. It's God coming down to us. One of the reasons why the doctrine of the Trinity becomes so confusing to people is that they try to picture... Okay, here. They try to picture... I want to get rid of that because what I'm going to say will appear like it just contradicted that, but just ignore that, okay? They try to picture the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit side by side. You might call this a, is this horizontal here? Or is that vertical? That's horizontal, okay. But I think that there are a million texts which tell us that we can't do that. John 14, 9, and 10 being one of them. If you look at me, you see the Father. The whole idea about Jesus Christ being the one place where God is pictureable precludes this sort of picture of God, which really comes to mean tritheism and that God is a committee. Rather, I wish I had a three-dimensional drawing here. Oh, this is getting bizarre. It's not that God is horizontal. God is vertical. The Father, who no one could see at any time, God is vertical. This class is stranger than you ever thought it was. He comes to us in the person of Jesus Christ, and then he grabs us in the power of the Holy Spirit to recognize who Jesus Christ is and thereby render us compatible to the Father. Or picture it. Is this getting anywhere? I don't think so. Okay, this is the infinitude of God. Now, out from the infinitude comes the Son. Okay, picture me as the Son. I'm the Son of God. I'm revealing the Father, which isn't right now very complimentary, but picture this. God in his infinitude. Jesus Christ reveals everything there is to reveal about God, and now the Holy Spirit, God Almighty, existing in a third way, gives you the capacity to recognize that I am the revelation of God. God, Father, coming to us in the Son, grabbing us in the Holy Spirit and bringing us back to Him. It's not a God, God, God, but rather God one way, God the second way, God the third way. And the whole thing centers on the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is God coming to us, and Jesus Christ is us going to God. The doctrine of the Trinity is really a way of fleshing out who Jesus is. Can you say amen, somebody? Okay, you were mocking my drawing. Okay, one third thing about the doctrine of the Trinity. Oh, sorry. I couldn't see it. See, you people on the tape, you're missing all these wonderful drawings of mine. But such it is. I hope you're getting the gist of it even though you don't see what I'm drawing. In all likelihood, you're probably understanding it a lot better because you're not seeing my drawings. Can you send some words for a copy of the drawing? Yeah, that's what I should do. I should... Okay. The third thing that's significant is this. The doctrine of the Trinity says, in Scripture, you not only have that God, the idea that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, as though that began at a certain point in time. There's enough in Scripture to tell us that God always exists like this. So, for example, Jesus Christ, when he's here on earth, he talks about preexisting with the Father. John 17, 5, Father, glorify me with the glory which I had with you before the world began. He talks about himself as eternal in John 8, 58. Before Abraham was, I am. He talks about having come down from the Father. It's very clear that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, didn't just begin to exist when he was born in Bethlehem. He began to exist as a man in Bethlehem, but the word is eternal. John 1 tells us that. In the beginning was the word. So there always was the Father, God existing in one way, the Son, God existing in another way, and the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, Jesus says, will send the Holy Spirit down from heaven, assuming that the Holy Spirit always was up there. You see, he doesn't say, hey, we're going to create a Holy Spirit. No, the Holy Spirit always exists. So God eternally exists like this. And here's what's significant about that. That may seem like a kind of trivial metaphysical truth. Oh, so God always has this internal relationality. But as a matter of fact, I think it's very significant because it tells us that God is personal and loving within himself. The Bible says that God is love. Now, you can't be love without loving. And to love, there has to be in some way, now, don't picture this, because the minute you picture it, you're going to go wrong. But in some way, God has internal sociality. He's social within himself. There's something like love going on within God's own self. An analogy might be something like this. When I'm alone, I can talk to myself, I relate to myself, I argue with myself. God doesn't do that, though. But a person who loves himself, they're happy to be alone. They're content. They're full. They don't need other people always to be filling up vacuums in their life. There's a fullness there. God is eternally full within himself. He's loving and personal within himself. Contrast that now with a non-Trinitarian view of God. A view, you know, there are various groups like the Jehovah Witnesses or the United Pentecostal Church, which are very, you know, they want to stress that God is in no sense internally a multiplicity. In no sense is there a threeness in God. Well, to them, if God, that means God throughout eternity, never related to another. There's never a thou to relate to. This is a solitary individual existing in the eternal blackness of space. And an individual like that could never love. Unless there's something like an I and a thou, there cannot be any kind of loving reciprocity. Reciprocal. There is a word reciprocity, I think. I was making it up. Reciprocity within the Godhead. Oh, I love these fancy words. The phenomenological reciprocity of God's existential dilemma. Are you impressed? But there can be no I-thou-ness. God can't be full and loving within himself. At least there's no way of ever conceptualizing that. It's a solitary God who just exists in the expansive space. With the doctrine of the Trinity, though, God is internally full within himself, which means this. If God decides to have another, that is to say to create a world, he does it not because he needs the world, but out of grace. He doesn't create the world because he needs us. He creates the world because he wants us. He doesn't create it out of a deficiency. He creates it out of an abundance. In a real healthy relationship, in a marriage relationship, you would have a child, not because the mother longs to fill a hole in her life, or the father wants to have a great football player. The kid isn't there to meet the parent's needs. Unfortunately, very frequently kids are born for that purpose. But in a healthy relationship, the child would be born so that the love between the parents could be expressed more fully. The love overflows in giving way to a child. I think that's the way the creation was intended. The love between the parents. I don't know if you've taken biology or not, but that's kind of what produces the child. And so even biologically, it's a natural outgrowth of the love that two people have for one another. So also with God. He creates the world as an expression of his fullness. Not to get full. In order to express what he has. It's a matter of sheer grace. It's a matter of sheer grace. It's an extra in God's life. That doesn't mean that you're not important. Any more than in a healthy relationship, the child's not important. But it does mean that your job isn't to make God full. And that's a real freeing thing. Your job isn't to make God happy. God's happy. He's also very sad. how to put those things together is a tough thing. But in terms of his own identity, he's very secure. I've talked with him many times. He's very psychologically sound. It's a matter of grace. Your existence is a sharing of God. He's sharing with you something. Here, have some existence. And let's share and love together. It's an expression. It's an overflow. It doesn't. I think only a triune view of God, A God that has within himself internal relationality. Only that view of God can say that consistently. He doesn't need the world to be loving. He's already loving. But if there never existed anyone outside of God until he created the world, then he couldn't possibly, his nature couldn't be loving. He would need the world to love in order to be loving. But with the Trinity, he's loving within himself. Questions? I can't believe we only have five minutes left. Yes. Well, I asked God about that one time, and he said, no, no. No, there is no proof. No, we have no idea. C.S. Lewis said, the chickens in the coop only need to know that the farmer cares for them. They don't need to know if there's other coops or something like that. Forgive me, C.S. Lewis. I just butchered C.S. Lewis. But something like that, we only know about our own stuff here. But I don't feel any need. Some people say, well, with all these billions of stars, and we know that there are many planets connected with each star, it would be superfluous if God didn't have life on other planets. It seems to me that God is into fluff. He's showing off. If he only created what was necessary, we would never know what he's capable of. To me, it glorifies God more for him to just spin out these billions of stars and then choose just one little minuscule one that's so insignificant to fall in love with. I think it doesn't make us feel, it shouldn't make us feel less important, but more important. It shows off the love of God. You know, the less significant we seem, the greater his love appears when he loves us. So I personally think that all, I don't know, but I bet all this stars and stuff is extra. He's always doing extra stuff. You know, I mean, why on the day of Pentecost? Did he need a rushing miter wind? He was showing off. The Northern Lights, what's he doing there? Why are there so many brands of insects in the world? Brands of insects. Go to the street shopping, get brands of insects. We don't need all those, but he's in the fluff. All the beauty, the peacock. He doesn't need all those colors, I don't suppose. Maybe there's a biological reason. But one of the things that the evolutionists have never been able to explain sufficiently is why there's all these extras, you know, with humans and others. There's just a lot of this. So I think God just likes to display. Thank you.
