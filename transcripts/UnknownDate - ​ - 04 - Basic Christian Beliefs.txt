So I want to, I pause just for you tape people. I hope you appreciate this. If you appreciate me as a person, call me at my office at Bethel. Thank you. I probably get a call at four in the morning sometime in my home. God's eternal. He's eternally the same, which means in the middle of your life where everything is changing, you're getting old, you're decaying. Isn't that a wonderful thought? You're on your way down. If you're over 20, you're on your way down. Nothing is permanent. It's true. I love running ultra marathons. I love doing that. I love running long distances. Now the doctor tells me I've got to quit because my knees are getting too screwed up. And then he says, after all, you are 34 years old. I'm not. I'm a kid and I can do whatever I want. My buddy says so. It's a hard thing to accept. Your knees aren't permanent. Your tendons aren't permanent. Nothing is permanent. Everything. All we are, as the song says. I know you're saying, please don't sing again, please. But Kansas says, dust in the wind. All we are is dust in the wind. I close my eyes only for a moment, and the moment's gone. Dust in the wind. Well, everything is dust in the wind except God, who alone has immortality. He's been forever the same. Your friends change. They like you today. They don't like you tomorrow. Your parents change. They never did love you, so when they don't love you, there's no lust. But everything changes except for God. And then God, as a gift, gives to those who believe in him that same immortality, that same kind of life that will never change, that will never end. You have eternal life. If you're a believer, you have eternal life. You have it. It's yours right now. You're in the beginning of eternal life. It's not something that just waits for you. John says we have eternal life right now. Never going to die. The body will die. My tenants may give up, but I'm going to live forever. So God is eternally the same. Now, a theologian's squabble, that's what employs us, so you should at least know what the squabble is. There's different ways of thinking about eternity. Some see God's eternity as being timeless. Timeless, which means he doesn't experience any time. In fact, this has been the standard view throughout church history. Let me just kind of give it to you here. Here's a way of thinking about it. I hate this cord. I'm all tangled up. so God's like God's like this I don't know yellow chalk this is all I need this is an eyeball and God hey people they're laughing at my drawing that you can't see I don't know why I made a bloodshot but and here's time in this view God sees all of time as being the same he sees it all in one instant he's above time so he sees Abraham sacrificing or going to sacrifice his son the same time he sees Jesus on the cross, the same time he sees me teaching this class. It's one momentary blick for God. It's like a snapshot. And he sees all the time in one moment. That's been the standard view throughout church history. I think that comes right out of Aristotle. Aristotle had that view of God. But I don't find that in the Bible at all, that God is above time. It seems to me to be too detached, as though God weren't involved in the temporal process. The other way of viewing eternity is simply that God always has been. He's in time. He experiences a before and after. In the first view, he doesn't experience a before and after. Everything is simultaneous. In the second view, and this is a view which has been around here and there throughout church history, but it's becoming more popular today. The second view just says, no, for God to be eternal, that just means he's always been. But he does experience a before and after. He's with us in time. He goes through your ups and he goes through your downs. He experiences change with you, but he's eternal. He never erodes. There's a lot of reasons why people have held God to be timeless. The main one was that they thought whatever changes is imperfect. Whatever changes is imperfect. And therefore, since God is perfect, he can't ever change, which means he can't ever experience a before and an after. To experience a before and after is to experience a change. One moment to the next moment is a change. and in the second view god is unchanging in terms of his character but not in terms of his experience he experiences each day new just like we do but his character never changes those are kind of two views uh of god's eternity the only thing i think that's at stake here is that it can be and i in the middle ages they had this a lot the idea that god's timeless makes god seem i think too far out there. He's not a part of what we're going through. He's sort of in this comfortable heaven looking down on us and doesn't go through any of the ups and downs that we go through. And that doesn't seem to me to be the biblical God. The biblical God, at least the way I read the Bible, is a God who is with us moment by moment. He asks us questions. He dialogues with us. He speaks. We answer. He responds. There's a give and take with God that I think presupposes that God is with us. He's shimmying along time with us. Dialoguing. He's not kind of up here in this, you know, timeless view. Okay, let's talk about omnipresence. Omnipresence simply means God is everywhere. I told you this was an introductory class in theology, and it is. Of course, God's everywhere. Well, he's omnipresent. Omni means all, present means what you know it means. omnipresent. So wherever you go, God is there. The main significance about that belief is not that kind of an interesting fact, that you could go to the moon and God would still be there, though he would. But it's not just an interesting fact. I think that the force of that, when Jesus says, you know, lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world, he's not just saying, that's how big I am. He's saying, that's how caring I am. And so to say God is everywhere is really a statement about God's care, about his, There's no place you can go that God's not going to be there. The psalmist says, even if I make my bed in Hades, which is the lowest thing he could think of, Hades, the grave or hell, God's going to be there. And I'm sure you've, well, maybe you haven't, but if you, you're blessed if you haven't, but probably you have experienced hell, a time in your life where you just feel like you're going through hell and you say, where is God? You know, you just don't feel God. He doesn't seem to be there. The biblical witness is that he's there. Even if you don't feel him, he's there. His promise is that he's there. And even if you're going through hell itself, he's there. He's everywhere. If at any point you have questions or comments, feel free to interject them, okay? Let's talk about omnipotence. What does omnipotence mean? Close, that's omniscience. All-powerful. Potent means power. impotent means powerless omnipotence means all power omni all potent power God is all powerful the basic significance of this is not just to say wow he's got a giant muscle sort of an Arnold Schwarzenegger God look at me I'm very strong God is very strong but he's not just about showing off his strength power means God's all powerfulness has this effect on us, I think, that in the same way that there's nothing we're going through that God's not going to be there, there's nothing we're going through that God can't do something about. That God can't do something about. You can trust Him. And sometimes that's hard to do. But His power means He's there. There's nothing that's going to happen in the world or nothing that's going to happen to you that's going to be outside of His control. The world is not a chaotic mess that's being governed by chance. God's in control, at least in this sense, that whatever's going on, it didn't take him by surprise, and he's not up in heaven wringing his hands, worrying what he's going to do. He's got it under control. It's okay. And he's powerful enough to bring good out of it. Yes? There's nothing God can do anything about. What that kind of takes for me is all the catastrophes in the hell that I've been through, my anger at God. I mean, if God is unorthodox, God could live. There's nothing he can't do anything about. Why did somebody make that? Good. Oh, what's your name? Joe. Joe just made a wonderful point there. Okay, it's a very good one. This is a very good point. And I can't tell you how much I resonate what you're saying. If God is in all control, which we have to flesh out what that means, But if there's nothing that he can't do something about, then why do you go through the hell you're going through? Why do kids get hit by cars? Why doesn't he do something then? If he can do something, why doesn't he do something? That's opening up a Pandora's box if ever there was one. Correct me, if I get sidetracked, bring me back to this, because that's one issue I don't want to sidestep. But I do want to bring out, it raises this issue. there's been two ways of understanding God's omnipotence and I know that this can seem kind of academic stuff but I think it has a lot of practical value so I'm always emphasizing the practical end of it though I hope you get some of the academic stuff along the way there's two ways of understanding God's omnipotence there's the Calvinistic way and the Arminian way I want you to leave this class tonight saying I know what Calvinism is, and I know what Arminianism is. Calvinism is this belief. John Calvin was a reformer. He came just after the time of Luther. Actually, their lives overlap a little bit. And Calvin believed this. If God is all-powerful, that means that there's nothing that happens that he didn't ordain. To be all-powerful means you're all-controlling. So nothing happens outside of God's will. Now, it may be, and nothing ultimately happens outside of God's will. Even evil is somehow ordained by God. Evil plays a role in God's providence. He doesn't like evil in and of itself, but he likes it in terms of what it will ultimately do. Okay, so everything is going to contribute to the good of the whole. Everything fits into the plot of God. In the same way that if I was writing a play, I might put in some evil characters there that I think are really yucky, but they make the story better for being there. In some way, they contribute to the overall plot. If I take them out of the script and tell someone, look at this character, they'll say, oh, yuck, what a terrible, yucky character. But if you put them back into the plot, you see how he fits into the overall scheme of things, and the story is better for him having been there. so also Calvin believes that everything that happens is written ultimately by God. Everything is predestined. That's the key word there, predestined. That's Calvin's belief. Not all Christians agree with Calvin. In fact, today probably the majority don't. The other school of thought, which the majority today tend towards, is Arminianism. It comes from a man named Arminius. Actually, these beliefs are much older than Calvin or Arminius, but they're the ones who have sort of made this issue popular today, so that's why we're talking about them. Arminius lived in the 17th century, and he said, No way. Calvin can't be correct. God doesn't ordain evil. For God to be omnipotent means that he's in all control, given his decision to have free creatures. that's a big provisio there God wants free creatures which means to some degree he surrenders his control he still keeps enough power in his back pocket to run the whole ship and nothing is going to be utterly out of his control but not everything that happens is going to be his will there are now a multitude of wills in the universe human wills and angelic wills. And they can do damage. They can't destroy God's overall plan, but they can cause a lot of pain. And if God's going to have a world in which there is that freedom, he has to let them, to some degree, have room to move. So for Arminius, God's also writing a script. He's writing a play. But he doesn't put in good characters and put in evil characters. He just puts in characters and he lets them write out some of the script on their own. God creates authors, as it were. He has the overall book. He knows what the overall book's going to look like, but he puts in characters to decide where individually they're going to fit in. And he weaves together all those different characters. Do you understand what Arminius' belief is and how it differs from Calvin's? Nod your head if you're getting the distinction. For Arminius now, and I'll just tell you that I side with Arminius, but that doesn't mean you have to, but you should know where I'm coming from. For Arminius, to say that there's nothing that God can't do something about means this. If someone does you evil, while God maybe had to give them the right to do evil, or else take away their free will, which God is normally not willing to do, if a person uses that free will to do evil on you, It's their fault for doing it, not God's. Blame them, get mad at them, get ticked off at them, hate the devil who ultimately leaves behind the whole thing, but don't get mad at God. But God is still powerful enough and wise enough to bring good out of it. He's that smart that no catastrophe has to be ultimately catastrophic. That he can bring good out of it. A good way to show the difference between Calvin and Arminius is to center on one verse. Romans 8 is a 28. All things work together for the better for those who love the Lord. Okay, there's two ways of looking at that verse. Calvin looks at it and says, look it, that means everything that happens to you is God's doing and it's for the better. Your kid got hit by a car, you getting raped. It's all for the better. You just got to be patient. All things work together for the better, for those who love the Lord. For Arminius, that verse is translated different, and both these translations are possible. Arminius understands it to be this. In all things, God is working together for the better, for those who love the Lord. Not that all things, God works all things together for the better, for those who love the Lord, as though God ordained it, but no matter what happens to you, God's going to be working together for the better. In other words, whatever catastrophe happens to you, if you turn to the Lord and surrender to the Lord, God can bring good out of that. He didn't necessarily will the thing to happen to you, but given that it happened to you, He can bring good out of it. I'll tell you a little testimony here. That maybe will make the point a little more tangible. Last year, not last year, it was this year, but it was back in late March, early April. I had a tremendous amount of things going on in my life, spiritually. I was pastoring in this church, and God was doing some incredible things in this church. And I was doing some seminars, and God was doing some incredible things in these seminars. And it was just really kind of, it was just awesome to see God doing this stuff. I came under incredible attack from the enemy in the most overt way I've ever experienced. My family came under attack. It was bizarre how intense this attack was. My oldest daughter is a young lady who has, from childhood, she's still a child, she's only 10, but she's been spiritually gifted. She has an ability to see past the physical and see spiritual stuff. She's always had this ability. There's always been weird things that have surrounded her. I think it's a gift. I'm coming to recognize it as a gift. It used to freak me out. but now I see it as a gift but she was especially an object of attack to the point where and this is going to sound really weird to a lot of you off the wall to a lot of you I don't even know if you're going to accept this but I'm going to give it to you anyways to the point where she was seeing demonic stuff in her room and feeling demonic attacks on her I was seeing demonic stuff in her room it was just the most overt stuff I can imagine it was really nightmarish and we were both having bizarre dreams terrorizing stuff and the point what the objective of the enemy was was to intimidate me and my wife so that I back off from what I was doing and it almost worked because I wouldn't I didn't want to leave the home leave my wife alone for a weekend when I went out and did something I this was happening right around the time that that the singles were having the retreat up north and I did that retreat the first morning of that retreat on Saturday morning we were singing some songs and praising god and in the middle of that i this thing with my daughter had just happened the uh that wednesday and i had you know in the middle of a catastrophe you have to sort of toughen up you can't let yourself feel emotions you got to be in control and that's what i was doing but when i got away to this weekend retreat which i almost didn't go to because of this stuff uh all the emotions caught up to me and i was just absolutely destroyed in emotionally and physically. It was really cleansing. We're singing this song, The Battle Belongs to the Lord. And as we were singing this, I was just worshiping the Lord, and I saw the Lord come to me. This is how I relate to him. I pictured him in my mind. He just came to me. And he went over to my daughter, who was really being terrorized by these demons. It was like a kid who woke up from a nightmare. Or did you ever see kids having night terrors? This was like a night terror, but she never went to sleep. She just saw the stuff. And I was afraid of losing her. I thought she might go crazy. I didn't know what was going on. And I felt totally out of control, which was a new kind of feeling for me because I always felt like I was in control. You know, I got a bag of tricks. I know how to raise kids. All of a sudden, I felt totally out of control. The Lord, to complicate that, that was an Achilles heel for me because my issue has always been the abandonment of kids. I've had the most trouble trusting God when I've seen kids suffer. Because I ask, where are you, God? Why don't you do something about that? My faith turns into noodles. When I read a story or see some kid being abused or whatever, I just, it kills me. And a lot of that has to do with my own abandonment issues. Because as a kid, I felt forsaken. And so I project my own hurt onto these other kids, and I empathize with them so strongly. Jacob Witterling, he's been an obsession of mine. Can't get him out of my mind. I do all these charity raisers because I can feel what a kid must feel like. I can't, but I can sort of feel what he must feel like. And I wonder, where is God? In the midst of this then, Jesus came to me. And he said, Greg, you're going to have to trust me in this. You're going to have to trust me. And we're singing this song now and stuff. The battle belongs to the Lord. And it becomes a decision. Does it belong to the Lord or does it belong to me? And so Jesus and I have this debate in the middle of this song. And I'm just gushing with pain here. And I said, Jesus, how can I trust you? I don't see that you were there for me as a kid. And I don't see you there for a lot of these other kids. And how do I know you're going to be there for my kid? How can I entrust her to you? And the Lord says, I can bring good out of this, Greg. I feel your pain, I understand, but I can handle this. I'm big enough. And I argued with him some more. I said, but how can I trust you? You know, I don't see you there. I don't sense that you were there Wednesday night when she was going through this. My daughter at one point kind of came out of this trauma she was going through. She grabbed my hand. She said, Dad, can you help me? Why don't you help me? Another point she came in here. I was saying, Jesus loves you. Jesus loves you. And at one point she said, then why doesn't he stop what's going on? Now where is that voice coming from? And I just hit right where it hurts, right on my Achilles heel. And I'm getting a picture of all this going on while Jesus is talking to me saying, I can handle this, Greg. I can handle this. finally while i'm still unsettled he goes over to my daughter in in in i i think this is what the bible means when you talk to the lord in the spirit this is in the spirit and i'm seeing the lord do this he goes over to my daughter who's screaming and full of terror and he hugs her and he comforts her and he just kind of starts kind of petting her hair and she starts calming down she gets really kind of tranquil and there's peace in the room and the demonic stuff's gone and he and he's got this kind of smile on his face and my doll looks really serene and he says Greg you're gonna have to trust me on this one and I still say but how can I be sure and he said and he had a smile on his face kind of a joking smile but a tender one and he goes you've got no choice it was it was right I had no choice that Jesus got a sense of humor he goes Greg you've got anything he goes you've got no choice. He was right. But the thing is that he won my love. He won my trust by what he did. He didn't give me an answer. I don't have an answer to all of it. It has something to do with free will. Okay? Demonic beings have free will and they can terrorize kids. It's not fair, but they can do it. Rapists do the same thing and that's not fair, but they can do it. They've got free will. Free will means that unfair crap goes on in the universe. He didn't give me an answer, But he won the trust by what he did, by what he showed me. And there was a real healing that took place in me. So here's this terrible demonic situation. Jesus comes into it, wins my surrender. And from that surrender, I was healed from a hurt in my life in a way that I'd never been healed. More than an intellectual answer could ever heal me, this healed me. Some of my own childhood stuff was healed through seeing Jesus do this. Some of my trust for the Lord was healed. The other thing is that it performed an incredible healing on my daughter. My daughter has grown right after that. The battle didn't end there, but for the most part it did. Kind of had the house cleansed and stuff. And from that point, my daughter has had a joy about her that she's never had up to that point, a trust in Jesus that she never had up to that point. She's come to understand herself as being gifted, though she's kind of freaked out about that. But, you know, she sees herself as being special in Jesus' eyes. And the other thing was that on this retreat, were some of you there? You were there? Well, you know what a mess I was when I got up to talk. That was, in human terms, I was an absolute, I blew my nose about 45 times in the microphone. I never couldn't. These big snotty ones, too. I was so wiped out. But God ministered at that retreat in some incredible ways at a time when I felt utterly incapacitated. I felt so weak and so dizzy and dull and lifeless in the flesh. And God just did some incredible things in people's lives. And I still am hearing about that, calls and stuff. And that really taught me something about what it is to walk in the Spirit and not walk in the flesh. Because I didn't realize how much I had been relying on the flesh. So what God does is he wiped out my flesh so I had no choice. They're paying me to get up and talk, and I say, I can't. Well, you've got no choice. You've got to do it. And then he says, watch what I can do, Greg. If you just get out of the way, watch what I can do. And that taught me something about ministry, what it is to walk in the Spirit and not rely on your own learning or what have you. There are an incredible number of great things that happened out of that terrible incident. In all things, God was working together for the better. I don't think God turned those demons loose on my daughter. He didn't say, sick them. But given the fact that we're being terrorized, God says, I see a great opportunity here, and he's powerful enough and wise enough to bring good out of it. It's almost as though, in fact, it is better that I had gone through that than that I hadn't gone through that. Now, how God does that is, I don't know. He can take an event that is terrible and actually make it better for having happened. So it looks like the whole thing was planned all along. He's just that smart. Well, give me some questions or issues that you have. Yeah. I think a lot of people use the natural disasters as evidence that there isn't a caring God. There might be a God without caring God. How do you resolve that? How do you address that issue? Yeah. Those are really good. My dad asks that all the time. What about natural disasters? And the answer is very complex, if there is an answer at all. My response to the person is this. You have to explain to me all the good stuff in the world, as well as the evil. Granted, there's evil, but where do we get good from? Can time and chance produce beings? If there is no God, can time and chance produce beings that are loving and rational and moral? Doesn't the fact that we are rational and loving and moral mean that the source from which we came is rational, loving and moral, you've got to explain the rationality and the morality and the lovingness of the world before you attempt to explain the evil, or at least you have to explain that as well. So that's a problem for them that they have to face, and I think that's an overwhelming problem. With regard to the evil, there's a lot of different ways of nuancing that. A lot of it can just be, I think, accident and whatever. I'd say over half of natural disasters, earthquakes can't be prevented, but people dying from earthquakes could, and most starvation could be prevented if people weren't so greedy, and if there wasn't politics and stuff tied up with that. So the earth does some weird things like shifting plates and tornadoes and hurricanes, but I bet we could prevent most of the bloodshed from it if we were more altruistic, if we were more the creatures that God intended us to be. So a lot of natural evil, if not most natural evil, comes down to be actually another version of moral evil but the other thing i'd say is this the world the bible tells us is under siege we are under attack we've been under attack for thousands and thousands of years in fact we're held into a stronghold first first john 5 19 says that that the whole world is under the control of the evil one that's why it's called the principality and power of the air there's there's a super free will involved here that's not god's and that is satan's and he holds this planet like this and what god is doing is delivering this planet but i but at least i think in one way or another all the evil that goes on the world natural or moral is in one way or another a sign that we're victims of warfare there's a battle being raged and we're in the center of it and in this battle that's way beyond what i can imagine evil things happen uh and satan loves destruction he loves death he loves all of that and so i wouldn't put it past him to to the degree that he's able bring about earthquakes or whatever. Just like there's a rapist who gets in his mind, I want to rape somebody, and they rape somebody. They have a free will. God gave them that. They're not a robot. They choose to do it, and they do it. And God can only prevent that by making them a robot. So also, Satan is raping the planet Earth. And without going into the whole issue, I think that all the deformations in childbirth, all the screwed up things that go on in existence, people being born with all sorts of physical deformities and spiritual deformities and emotional deformities, we're all victims of war. or bombs going off all over the place. We just can't see it. And it ultimately has to do with that. If God were the only will in the universe, we'd still be in paradise. But he's not. He created us so that we could love him, which means he created us free, which means we're going to end up there, but we're going to end up the long route. And not everyone's going to end up there. Good question. Okay, well, that took a little longer than I had anticipated, but it's a good issue. God's omniscient this is what is meant by God's all-knowing he's all-knowing omniscient omni all knowledge omniscient the significance of this is very similar to the significance of omnipotence God knows you and that's not a threatening, a lot of times I don't know how you were raised but I was raised with the idea that God is always looking at you so better be good kind of thing god's the eye in the sky looking at you he can read your mind um and uh yeah there's a song about that somewhere on the line uh you know so you know it's better shape up and he's the big dysfunctional father in the sky is going to spank you when you screw up that i i don't see anywhere in the bible where where god's knowledge is is used as a beating club like i i know what's going on there you know i see you kind of santa claus he knows you when you're sleeping he knows you when you're awake. He doesn't know you when you're sleeping. He knows when you're sleeping. He knows when you're awake. I remember trying, you know, this is terrible. Santa Claus knows if you're still awake and he's not going to come until you go to sleep. And if you don't ever go to sleep, he's not going to come. Well, now I got to try hard to go to sleep. This is great. So, you know, as a little kid, you're trying hard to go to sleep, which means you're not going to go to sleep because you're trying so hard. It's kind of the double bind you get in the Christian message too. You know, you better love me or I'm going to send you to hell. Okay, I'll tell you. And the more you try to love that kind of God, the less you can. It's kind of a double bind. Well, that's not how omniscience is used. The omniscience is a thing of compassion. I know what you're going through. I know your sufferings. The Lord says that to Israel all the time. I know your plight. He knows what's going on there. He knows it not just theoretically. He knows it experientially. One of the most comforting things about the Christian belief system is this. I can know that whatever suffering I go through, Jesus has experienced that. Hebrews 4 says we have a high priest. We don't have a high priest who can't be touched with our sufferings because he in all respects was made just like we are. The one that we worship is also the one that has sided with us. And he knows what we're going through, not just kind of intellectually, he knows it experientially. He suffers when you suffer. That's why he said to Saul, Acts 9, when Saul's on the road to Damascus, he's persecuting the Christians. The Lord comes down knocks him off the horse and says so why do you persecute me taco said i'm i i have no problems with you it's the church i'm against but but for the lord to persecute the church was to persecute him he sides with you that's why it's so important to go back to this previous issue when you you know when people go through suffering we're inclined to blame god and it's so important i mean there's a time when you're ticked off where you just want to shoot at anything and god can handle it so go ahead and get mad at god if that's what you need to do but sometime along the line land on both feet on the ground where you understand that god's not your adversary he he's your compatriot he's on your side he's your best friend the trouble is when we go through suffering a lot of times we make our best friend our enemy we want to blame him when he's the very one that can get us through this whole thing deep inside i was angry at god for what was going on with my daughter i went when he's when she said why doesn't jesus do something i i was like right good point where why don't you but he was the one who was comforting my daughter who wanted to be there and wanted to bring good out of it and so stay friends with god stay in talking terms at least and he'll catch you through the tough times yeah it has something to do with free will yeah in a world that is sieged by uh by spiritual warfare there's going to be suffering if if you know jesus in the garden of gifts yeah I know there have been times in my life, but he has written on the wall, and he has part of the Red Sea. I could use a little more concrete direction. Yeah. I have an answer for that. Hang on. We'll check this puck. No, it's not there. Where's that answer? So we have an answer for, what's your name again? Joe. Joe. Well, you know, it comes down sort of this. I'm so eloquent on these answers. but you know what i just want why is faith necessary you know why does god make one of us to believe in him why does this kind of come down from the sky and say i'm the one and uh you know prove it to everybody you know uh and and so everyone would just fall down and worship him and there wouldn't be any guesswork here no faith involved why we need faith i think the answer is that that uh faith produces the kind of loving relationship that god wants it's i i think it has something to do like like this you know if you fall in love with somebody and you're thinking about getting married to them, you go through a courtship process first. You're courting. And that's when you find out about each other. And that's where trust develops. People who go out with a person one night and then go to Las Vegas and get married make a big mistake. Because love doesn't mature in that kind of environment. Love has to grow. And it has to be fostered. And it has to go through pain sometimes. And I think the faith relationship is the relationship that is appropriate for creatures at our level in order to grow in love with God, to really get to know God, and to grow and become the kind of creatures that he created us to be. And there's something beautiful about it. At least sometimes you can see that. There's something beautiful about the faith relationship. If he came down to the sky like a giant Arnold Schwarzenegger and said, you know, worship me, then people would be worshiping God, but they wouldn't be loving God. I mean, people with ungodly hearts would be doing it just for all the wrong reasons. As it turns out, people still do that. But at least in this case, God can put it in a person's heart to have faith and a loving relationship, and that relationship can develop in a way that it couldn't if he just came down out of the sky and made it perfectly obvious for everyone. Why doesn't it knock harder in troubled times I think has something to do with that. He was there in that bedroom while my daughter was going through that stuff, but I wasn't in a position to hear. He could have probably spoke louder there, but now that I'm through it, I can look back on it and kind of see why he didn't. I wouldn't have been healed if he had bulldozed me over at that point. I had to grow through what I grew through in order to learn what I learned. The other thing is that if God bulldozed us over whenever we needed it, that wouldn't preserve our free will. The relationship has to be based on faith. It has to be based on choice. And that means God's never going to be as obvious as he might be. In heaven it will be obvious, but now it always involves choice. It's always a decision. Like a marriage. It's always a decision, and it takes faith. And so I think it has something to do with that. Again, it goes back to the free will thing. In short, I haven't got a clue! No. Does that kind of address your issue too? No, it doesn't? Well, maybe that's the farther I can go. All powerful, all knowing, all present, and yet he's not going to bulldoze over people. He doesn't want robots. He wants decision makers who choose. And so he'll leave you enough slack to choose. I mean, for some people, well, whether it's for you, you said, I mean, it goes back to when you're a kid. I mean, how can you dress down to some of the healthy ones? You know, there's no intellectual answer I can give you except this. And this isn't an intellectual answer, but it would be this. Let Jesus come to you and win. Win that from you. I can't win it from you, but he can. However bad it was for you, he can show himself off to be so beautiful and loving that even when you don't have an intellectual answer, he wins your heart. And so you can lay that question aside. It has something to do with free will, but that probably doesn't cut the mustard if the stuff's really painful. But he can, you know, at this point I'd shift gears and say, sit down with some nice music and picture Jesus and let him come to you and let him win your love. Let him win your trust. Let him take you back to the time when you were a kid and redo that stuff. And maybe you weren't loved back then, but he can love you. And let him begin to heal you by healing your memories of you as a child. Let him show off his beauty. and you'll be able to at least rest with the paradoxes of it until you get up there and see things clearer. It's all foggy now. We're in the middle of spiritual warfare. Nothing is clear, but Jesus can come to us clearly and show us how beautiful he is, and that can kind of settle the dust in the meantime. There's one issue about omniscience. I just want to state it and then kind of move on, but it's this. Everyone agrees, all Christians agree, that God is omniscient. He knows all things. Whatever there is to know, God knows. Not all agree about what there is to know. The issue is not about whether God's omniscient. The issue is about what there is for God to be omniscient about. Some Christians believe, some theologians believe, though this is a minority here, but it's worth thinking about, that the future doesn't exist yet. That if God is going a long time with us, the future is nonexistent. at least insofar as it's open for people to make decisions, so God does not know it as existent. He knows whatever exists as it exists. He knows whatever doesn't exist because it doesn't exist. So if the future doesn't exist yet, it's no fault of God if he doesn't know it. So some believe that God faces the future with a certain amount of indefiniteness. He knows what he's going to do. He knows whatever he's predestined to happen. He knows the general outline of the story. He knows the future insofar as it's a natural outcome of the present, but insofar as there are left open questions of free decision, that is an open story. He'll never get caught off guard because he knows every possibility, but that doesn't mean he knows with certainty everything that's going to happen. And there are some biblical passages, actually there are biblical passages that go either way. There are some passages which tell us that God knows the future, at least in certain respects, perfectly. That's where you get prophecy from. So certainly he knows a great deal about the future. And some interpret those to mean that God knows the future totally. Others say no. That just implies that God knows a great deal about the future, whatever he's going to do. But it still leaves room open for free decisions. So that's the issue there. Why don't you just chew on that for a while, unless something really grates you and you want to ask it now. Okay, let's move on. Oh, finally, there's three other things to be said, and then we're going to end. God is loving. God is loving what are you going to say about this when the Bible says God is loving it means it because a lot of times what you associate with loving people said I love you didn't mean it when God loves he loves unconditionally the ultimate act of love is to give worth to another isn't it to give worth to another I love you when I love you not because of who you are I love you to make you something that you're not. I give worth to you. I ascribe worth to you by saying, you're valuable to me. True love is unconditional love. There's no strings attached. God is the ultimate unconditional lover. God loves without strings. He's the worth giver. He doesn't love on the basis of worth. He loves to give worth. That's what true love is. I don't love you because I love you in order to create worth. love is that unilateral movement there god is is the worth giver the ultimate act of love is to create you i mean how much you know we love each other to kind of add on to what a person already is god creates you so if you ever wonder does god love me ask yourself this tough question do i exist and would i exist if god didn't create me the answer is no and the fact that god creates you, it shows he's giving worth. He loves you. It's an act of love to create. So he brings into being. We have a little mini example of that when we have kids. Love creates. We beget children. We're sort of secondary means. That's kind of it. And you love this baby because you created it. You gave it worth. You gave it existence. Secondarily, God is the ultimate author there. But you have a little taste of what it is for God to give love. His love brings forth existence. He creates in us our physical existence. And then when we're saved, he creates in us new creatures. Salvation is another act of unilateral worth giving. He loves you. He didn't create you because you were something, because you didn't exist. He just created you because he wanted to create you. So also was salvation. He didn't save you because of something he saw in you. In that case, he'd be finding worth, not giving it. But he's loving. He doesn't find worth. He just gives it. So he looks at you in your fallen condition, and he gives you worth. He gives you eternal life. He says, I love you anyways. And he pays whatever price it takes to make you the kind of creature he wants you to be, namely the cross. The two ways you know God loves you is this. He created you and he died for you. What else could he do when you think about it? God's ultimately loving and we're out of time. Cindy, will you please remind me where we ended next week? We have to talk about God's justice. We need to talk about God's graciousness. How does grace fit in with His love and justice? And then we need to talk, oh, for a minute or two about the Trinity and solve all the problems in that thing. And that will get us caught up to where we should have been tonight. I told you that we're going to be kind of going behind, so don't worry about that. As you go throughout the week and think about these things, write down questions you might have, okay? Because you have really good questions, and I like those questions. And usually you learn a lot more by asking questions than just by somebody out here kind of bombarding truth on you. So feel free to ask a question. Is this a short one because I want to keep people? That sounds like trouble to me. If it's too long, I'll just dismiss everyone and we can talk. Is the Trinity and Christian doesn't believe in the Son of God's power? That's not a short question. If you have a razor blade to your arm, I'll talk about it. But if you can wait until next week. How about if you raise that next week? My answer would be yes and no. I don't love theologians. We always can. Yes and no. When in doubt, say yes and no. Or sort of. Thank you.
