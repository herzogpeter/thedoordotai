Two weeks ago, we did something that I can't, quite frankly, I can't remember ever having done it before. Because of a snowstorm, we canceled church. We had church Saturday night, and I even warned the people on Saturday night because the storm was coming and we didn't know what to expect, that the possibility existed that the sermon I was preaching that night I would preach again. I did that last night. It was very weird. Oddly, there was a lot more people there Saturday night than there was two weeks ago. It was a very weird decision to make. I remember the night before the storm, that Saturday before Sunday, I was out with my wife. We have a four-wheel drive truck type of thing. And around 10.30 at night, I was out with Bonnie. And if you have a four-wheel drive, you kind of feel invincible. It's like, why you have a four-wheel drive? This is why. So I was looking for snow dress, and we were blasting into him, and the snow was flying over. It was really kind of fun. And so we just needed to wait a little while longer. So Bonnie went to bed at 12.30 in the morning. I went out again by myself and got about to the end of my street and going, I don't think anybody's going to come and help me at 1230 in the morning. And I was kind of bottoming out. So I pulled around as quickly as I could get back into my garage. And at that time, there were eight more inches being predicted. So I said, I was thinking, this is a no-brainer. We're not having church tomorrow. This is not going to happen. So I go to sleep, and I wake up, and birds are chirping. I walk out. The paper got delivered. I'm going, what? I spent the rest of the day second-guessing that thing. But we did what we did. And here we are. One thing, so I'm preaching this sermon again. I've rewritten it twice since then. I second-guessed a lot of things that week. In fact, I told the people last night, I think most of the people who had heard it maybe weren't there, but some came back and heard it a second time, hoping I would get it right. And we'll see about that. But we really took a financial hit. as you can imagine, on that. And those of you who consider Open Door your home, we just encourage you to help us out, kind of step up to the plate and give generously, as you give so often in so many different arenas. We're not going to take a special offering or anything like that, but there will be offering plates at the door as you leave, and just over the next couple of weeks, we need to make up for that. Let's pray as we move to the ministry now of the Word. Father, I thank you for the work of your Spirit among us already, the context of worship, Lord, even the work of your Spirit among us in the commissioning of Nina and the praying for her family and how important that is to us as your people, to have people like her among us giving oversight and wisdom to your Holy Church. As we move now into the Word, I pray the continued work, freedom, power, authority that only comes by the working of your Spirit through the Word, we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. This morning as we re-engage with this series of sermons that we've been calling the way of the rabbi where we're coming to know Jesus as our rabbi, I want to visit one more time a pattern that we had begun to notice actually a couple of weeks ago in the life and ministry of Jesus where people, upon first seeing what Jesus did and hearing what Jesus said would be amazed at what he did and said, Matthew 7, Mark chapter 1, Luke chapter 20, because he acted and spoke as one having authority, not like the other teachers of the law that they were accustomed to hearing. And he also had power such that even demons obeyed his words, so people initially would follow him, often in large numbers. Matthew 4, early on in the story, it says that great multitudes were following him from Decapolis in Jerusalem and even beyond the Jordan, only to eventually, and sometimes quite abruptly, and this is the pattern we noticed, fall away, to withdraw from him after initially being amazed by him. It says in John chapter 6, not walking with him anymore. And so for the last couple of weeks, we've been wondering why. What explains this pattern of initial interest and then not so much? Well, over the last couple of weeks, we've identified a few reasons. But the one I want to examine today has to do with the way Jesus said his kingdom would come. It has to do with the strategy, he said, would release all this power of the kingdom of God that he evidently was manifesting. Now, keep this in mind historically, contextually, something that we've been trying to make clear for several weeks as we kind of lay this foundation for understanding Jesus as a rabbi, that most first century Torah-observant Jews in Jesus' day had what we've been referring to as a kingdom of God expectation, where one day they believed God's kingdom would break through into human history. And when God's kingdom would break through into earth, Everything that was wrong would be made right, which explains, at least in part, some of the initial interest in Jesus. Maybe he's the one, especially when he moved with such power and authority, maybe he's the one who knows the way that the kingdom would come. But it was precisely his way, his strategy for bringing the kingdom of God to earth that gave some of the people who initially were interested in him pause. For my kingdom, said Jesus, in a variety of ways, will not come, will not be made manifest by muscling up, by becoming bigger, bolder, louder, stronger, richer than the kingdoms of this world. Indeed, its reality and its power will not be made manifest in the world through what we have called here at Open Door in the past, a power over strategy. It will be made manifest when we adopt a power under strategy. Not by grasping will this kingdom be experienced by individuals or by nations, but by releasing, not by ascending, but by descending. Not by winning, but by losing your life will you find it. For I came, said Jesus, not to be served, which is the position of power and why you want power, so people take care of you. I came to serve. And not only to give my life away, but to show people how that they can gain their life by giving their life. And the fact is that many, upon hearing that, said in effect, you know Jesus, I was really with you on this kingdom of God thing, especially when you're giving free food and healing all these people and demonstrating all this power. I was really with you on all that until you started talking like this. And many withdrew from him, not walking with him anymore, at least in parts, because he that way of giving your life to find your life, of power under, not power over, will never work. Not in the real world. I mean, if we adopt that way of bringing the kingdom, of making what's wrong in the world right, how will we ever win? It'll never work. Now, this message concerning the way the kingdom comes, this is not a new message here at Open Door. Indeed, I've preached it a number of times in a variety of ways. Actually, last spring, this exact time last year, just prior to Easter, a few weeks before Easter, you may remember if you were here, I did a mini-series of sorts called Love Wends and then followed that by a series that brought us right into Easter called Dying to Live. but the first time I can ever recall really finding words for this, because this is the kind of thing you try to talk to and you try to get at, and as a speaker, I sometimes feel like I know what I'm trying to say. I'm not sure I'm really saying it well so people can get it. But the first time I really felt like I connected, and I found words for it. It was about actually four years ago, the context of a message where actually I was articulating our vision as a church. The second point of our vision being this. that we wanted to become the kind of people. It was our vision. I wasn't even sure we were this kind of people yet, but we wanted to become the kind of people who were having a kingdom of God influence in our community, city, nation, and even in the world, but that the way we wanted it to happen would not be by declaring ourselves to be the moral majority. Because there's more of us than them, we win. Because we're bigger, louder, stronger, richer, we win. No, it's not our vision. Indeed, the kind of influence we want to have in this community, city, nation, and maybe even world, the kind of influence that we actually believe can change the world is born of becoming a kind of people who are, first of all, experiencing ourselves and therefore exhibiting to others a kind of supernatural life and love, character and joy that actually would smell good to people. Paul talks about a fragrant aroma that smells a lot like God. And the reason it would smell good was because we love people, particularly the lost and the least of people, a lot like Jesus seemed to do when he invited to his table people that everyone else seemed to exclude, but to pull that off as a vision for our church, we actually have to become a different kind of people, which might explain to you all the talk around here. I don't know. I hope you notice. We talk a lot in our vision and teachings in various places, not just from the pulpit, but certainly from the pulpit, about things like transformation. Talk about it all the time. We talk about what it takes to become a different kind of person and how spiritual disciplines are involved in spiritual formation till Christ be formed in you and me. To clarify, at least part of what we mean by all of that, and to give you a picture of where all of this is coming from, we need to understand and maybe be reminded of something you already know, that there are two kinds of kingdoms. This is obvious. I just want to bring you back into this frame of reference, two kinds of kingdoms. Number one, there is the kingdom of God. Number two, there is the kingdom or the kingdoms of this world. And these two kingdoms are radically different. We live in them both. If we are kingdom people, the kingdom of this world, we live there. The kingdom of this world, we're desiring to put confidence in Jesus so we can live in the context of the kingdom of God right here and right now as well. but they are radically different, not only in nature and mission, but in method as well. And it's the methods that I want to talk about today. I'm calling this sermon Our Rabbi's Strategy for bringing the influence of God's kingdom into the kingdoms of this world. With all of that in mind, open your Bibles, if you have them, to John's Gospel, the 18th chapter. We'll be picking it up in the 33rd verse. set the context this way. Jesus is standing before Pilate, so it is his trial just hours, actually, before he will be crucified. Pilate, who is not sure what to do with Jesus, a bit suspicious of the charges being brought against him, and I think he probably had some sense that he was being set up to be the bad guy in all of this. So he asks Jesus in verse 33 to clarify, are you the king of the Jews. Jesus answers in verse 34, and he answers in classic rabbinic style as we've come to see Jesus as this master of life, this incredible rabbi. He answers Pilate's question with a question. Verse 34, are you saying this on your own initiative or did others tell you about me? Pilate, obviously tired of all of this, in 35, says, listen, your own nation and chief priests have delivered you up to me. So what have you done? Are you the king of the Jews or not? Jesus answers verse 37. You say correctly that I am a king. Indeed, for this I have been born. For this I have come into the world. But, and this is the key, my kingdom is not of this world, which, by the way, doesn't mean his kingdom isn't in the world. It is in the world. It means his kingdom isn't like the world. It isn't like the world's system. For if it were, back to verse 36, my servants, my disciples, my Talmudim would be fighting that I might not be delivered up to the Jews. In other words, if my kingdom were of this world, my disciples would be trying to win this thing, the way the kingdoms of this world try to win things like this with power over strategy by trying to be bigger, stronger, louder. Even if they weren't bigger, stronger, louder, they would be trying to be. But as it is, he clarifies, my kingdom is not of this realm. So it doesn't accomplish what it wants to accomplish that way, to which Pilate said, what? Matthew 20, another example. Disciples are in an argument, and this is actually kind of funny. If it weren't for the context and the pain that Jesus was about to face himself, which it indicates the disciples are just oblivious about most of what was going on and their own preoccupation with themselves. arguing about who would be the greatest among them, who would have power over in the kingdom of heaven. When the mother of the sons of Zebedee, James and John, go straight to Jesus with this request, verse 21, Jesus command that in your kingdom, can you see this? These two sons of mine may sit one on your right and one on your left. And hearing this, verse 24, the ten became indignant with the two brothers, I guess. And hearing that, the ten others were indignant, the two brothers said, Ma, what are you doing? Though that's not actually in the text. I do think it's what they said. Then Jesus called them to himself and said, You know, the rulers of the Gentiles, Lord, it over them. There's that word over, power over. And their great men exercise authority over them. That's how it works in the kingdom of this world. It's all about power over. That's how they get done what they get done. But it is not so among you. This is a little minor thing in verse 26. It doesn't say it's not supposed to be that way. No. No, it doesn't work that way among you. If you're serious about doing the kingdom of God and being a kingdom bringer, it doesn't work that way. It is not so among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you, in this kingdom we're interested in bringing, you shall be your servant. And whoever wishes to be first shall be your slave. And then he uses himself as the example who's going to show them what this actually looks like. For the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve. And the ultimate expression of that serving is to give his life away for many. And when they heard this, that this was how the kingdom was going to come, and not only was Jesus going to give his life away, but as a follower of this rabbi, he was going to ask you to do the same thing, many withdrew from him, not walking with him anymore. That'll never work. Matthew 26, another example. Garden of Gethsemane, the arrest of Jesus. You know the scene. Again, now it's just moments before his crucifixion. Peter, out of love for Jesus, well-intended zeal for Jesus. Please dial in to Peter's kind of the good guy in this scene. And a desire to promote the cause of Jesus pulls out a sword. The sword, which in the flow of this talk, is a symbol of power over authority. It's how you get what you want to get done in the kingdoms of this world. He pulls out a sword and swung it in defense of Jesus, cutting off the year, the high priest slave who was part of the group trying to arrest Jesus, to which Jesus said, verse 52, put away your sword. For a couple of reasons. One reason, Peter, I want you to put away the sword is in verse 53, chapter in Matthew. Here's one reason, because I have 12 legions of angels at my disposal. So, Peter, if we were going to do this power over thing, I don't know. I think I'd use the angels, not you. But we're not. I just wonder what. Maybe Jesus knew they would get it one day, but right here at the very end, they didn't. He's going to have to go all the way to Calvary. He's going to have to lay his life. He's going to have to show them how. So put away your sword. Second reason I want you to put away your sword, Peter, is in verse 52, because if you take up the sword, you will die by the sword, which means, among other things, simply this, that if you pick up a sword as your way of getting done what you want to get done, even if what you want to get done is a good thing, you will eventually find someone with a bigger sword, with a faster sword, with a sharper sword, with more swords, with a more skilled sword. you will find someone bigger, louder, stronger, richer. Because when you pick up the sword, the power over way, there just comes this escalation of louder, stronger, more connected, more powerful that just doesn't end. Bottom line in the kingdom of God, says Jesus, is the way we will fight and the way we will win will not be by picking up a sword, but by taking up a cross. It's just not going to be by cutting off our enemy's ears. In fact, the way we're going to win is by healing our enemy's ears. And I know you don't get it. It's going to be by doing good for even our enemies, by loving them enough to die for them, for it was while we were yet sinners, while we were yet sinners, enemies of God Christ died for us. And when we dial into that reality that Jesus died for us when we were still sinners separate from God, something in our heart begins to stir. We get realigned. We begin to get it, and we say, thank you, Jesus. Thank you for loving us enough to die for us, even when you were hated by us, to which Jesus says in Luke 14, I'm really glad you're grateful. It's important that you are grateful. but please, says our rabbi, don't just cheer for me. Come to church and sing songs about me. What I'd really like, what's going to change the world is if people start to follow me. Follow this way, particularly of bringing the kingdom. Indeed, whoever does not, Luke 14, 27, take up the cross as the primary way that we get things done in the kingdom of God, whoever does not take up that way, can't be my disciple, can't be my Talmudim, because you're not following my way, because this is my way. Still want to come? And many said no. The more you listen to the story, the more it becomes a non-negotiable thing with Jesus this way, because the primary way that the purposes of God are advanced in the world, that the kingdom of God is made manifest to the world, that the face of God is revealed to the world, is not by the power of the sword, but by the power of the cross. It is not by power over, but power under, by supernatural, sacrificial love, even for an enemy, for it was while we were yet sinners, enemies. Christ died for us. Indeed, beloved, this is so hardwired, This way of doing it is so hardwired into how the kingdom of God works that if you try to pull off a kingdom of God agenda, maybe a really good thing, but you use power over strategy, you use a kingdom of this world method to try and do a kingdom of God strategy, you invariably lose the unique nature, fragrance, authority, and power of the kingdom of God all together. You lose the whole thing. History is just clear on this. Many examples. Crusades come to mind immediately where the cross and the sword were fused, and on the sword was a cross, and they were doing God's work. They were doing it the kingdom of this world's way. Untold damage. A real extreme example, a couple of these, John Calvin, great theologian, great theologian, who wanted to experience a really good thing. He wanted to experience what you want to experience, and I want to experience the kingdom of God on earth. He had a dream of a utopian society, and it was going to happen in a place called Geneva, but he forgot something. What he forgot was that the kingdom of God he was trying to establish, which is a really good thing, is a power under kingdom. And because he forgot it, he decided to use power over methods to establish a kingdom, a power under kingdom. The power over methods involved forcing behaviors that were consistent with what he thought the kingdom of God should look like by use of law and fear of punishment. Church attendance in Geneva was compulsory, I guess, okay, that's fine. Adherence to certain tenets of theology was non-negotiable. Laws covered issues such as how many different dishes or foods could be served at a meal to avoid gluttony? Okay, fine. A father who christened his son, Claude, named him Claude, a name that is not found in the Old Testament, spent four days in jail, as did a woman whose hairdo reached an immoral height. Whatever. Single women who became pregnant were drowned. An adolescent who struck his parents was beheaded. Calvin's own stepson and daughter-in-law were executed for separate infractions. Hmm. That's pretty extreme. That's pretty extreme. But it's not unique. History, again, is full of this stuff. It's very interesting to note what happened to Christianity when Constantine, the Roman emperor, 400 years after Christ, where 400 years, the church had been growing in a very hostile environment with a power under message that was incredibly compelling. It was changing the world. Constantine became an emperor, became himself a Christian, supposedly. I don't know how real that was. But suddenly, Christianity was legal, became the official religion of Major League Baseball, actually, of the Roman Empire. New slogan, the church militant and triumphant. And so for the first time in history, four centuries after Christ, this power under kingdom had power over status. It had to feel great. Finally, we win. And they used their power over status to crush just about anybody who disagreed with them. And they lost it all. Why? Because whenever you try to use kingdom of this world strategies to advance the kingdom of God purposes, you lose entirely the radically unique nature of the kingdom of God altogether. But having said all that, I'm going to push this whole thing over to another place. that's maybe going to spin your head around a little bit because not all expressions of power over in the kingdom of this world is necessarily a bad thing. You're going to have to stretch your mind here a little bit because I'm going to go to another place for some balance here and I think reality. Indeed, in the right context, power over as it's functioning rightly in the kingdoms of this world is not only a good thing, it's an absolutely necessary thing. Let me explain by making some very important distinctions between the kingdom of God and the kingdoms of this world. Distinction number one. In the kingdoms of this world, behavior is controlled by use or means of law. Let me explain. In government, for instance, civic government, national government laws are designed with very clear and important intent to keep order, to prevent chaos, to protect people. And laws that protect people are good things. They are God-ordained things. Romans 13, 2 Peter 2 make that very, very clear. Power over to enforce behavior, to protect people. And the reason we need that power over thing in the kingdom of this world is because in a fallen world, people don't always do the right thing for the right reason. So we need to encourage people who won't do the right thing for the right reason to do the right thing, even if it's for the wrong reason. See, I don't really care why someone doesn't steal all my stuff and kill my family. I just care that they don't. steal all my stuff and kill my family. I'd like them to all have a good heart, but I know they don't. So I'm really grateful for power over. And so are you. See, power over in that context, when someone goes ahead and steals my stuff or kills my family, we're going to use power over on that guy or that woman. And we're going to put him in jail. So power over in that context, it's not only good, it's necessary. But here's the deal about power over. Even when it's at its best, it is still limited. Why? Well, you've probably already dialed into it. Because those laws, good as and necessary as they are, those laws do not have the power to change a person's heart. Indeed, they don't even have a lot of power to change a person's behavior. Because even with the threat of power over, people still steal and kill all the time. So those laws don't prevent that. I mean, the fact that there's a law against stealing, does that make you feel safe? No. I mean, you still like your doors, right? Why? Because even at its best, this power over thing is limited. It's necessary, and it's good, God-ordained, but it's limited because it can't change the heart, which is precisely where the kingdom of God does its work. But the problem is this. These changes of heart can't be forced with power over. You can't do it. It doesn't work. I mean, all you can do is force behavior. You can't capture a heart. A heart is captured most often by a supernatural kind of love that picks up a cross, not a sword. And Jesus started it. Indeed, it's the fact that he picked up a cross that won your heart. Second distinction that I think will help you get a picture of this, what I'm trying to say this morning, is that in the kingdom of this world, the talk is about crime. In the kingdom of God, the talk is about sin, which sets up a very weird dynamic, actually, because some things can be a crime in the kingdom of this world, but not a sin in the kingdom of God, while other things can be a sin in the kingdom of God, but not a crime in the kingdoms of this world. And while I've kind of spun you around there, let me give you some examples that make this very clear. In Nazi Germany, for instance, it was a crime to help or hide a Jew, but it wasn't a sin. In the kingdom of God, things like lust and greed, Gossip, adultery, divorce, homosexual behavior, and gluttony are sins. They miss the mark. Hamartia is the Greek word. But they aren't crimes. Question about this crime and sin thing. And what I just said are behaviors that are sins but not crimes. Would you feel better if those behaviors I just listed were crimes? Would you feel safer? if things, for instance, like adultery and divorce, just pick those two, were against the law, would that be a good thing? Would that be a healthy thing? Would it strengthen marriage? Because it was against the law to get a divorce, so everybody would stay married. Would it prevent adultery? Would it strengthen your marriage? Would it save your marriage if there was a law. Well, I think you can think that through far enough to go, no. Why? Because while in the kingdoms of this world with power over, while they can by law, they could force you to stay married, that law doesn't have the power to give you a good marriage. It doesn't move in that arena. It has no authority there at all. For that to happen, for you to have a good marriage, you would need what happens when the kingdom of God breaks through, when a heart is changed, where a life is transformed, and you become, or your spouse becomes, a different kind of person. But see, to get that requires an entirely different strategy. Not power over. Power under. But who believes that? Very few. Philip Yancey in his book, What's So Amazing About Grace, spoke of how, as a journalist, he would sometimes ask people what comes to mind when they think of evangelical Christians these days. They usually respond in political terms, says Yancey. because that's where we have recently become known and have gained influence. Yet, with all the talk of voting blocks and culture wars, all about power over, by the way, the message of God's relentless love and amazing grace tends to get lost, says Nancy. It is difficult, he says, if not impossible, to communicate the message of God's love and amazing grace from the corridors of power. Why? Because the kingdom of God is by definition, by essential nature, a power under kingdom whose agenda cannot be advanced with power over methods. Because as soon as you do a kingdom of God agenda with a kingdom of this world method, you lose the unique nature, fragrance, authority, and power of the kingdom of God altogether. The purposes of God are not advanced. The kingdom of God will not be made manifest. The face of God will not be revealed, but you might win. Now, with all of that said, let me get in some trouble. As most of you know, one of the political hot buttons of our day is that just about everybody is weighing in on in one way or another is the issue of gay rights and particularly gay marriage laws, for and against. Emotions around this issue run very, very high. Opinions are strong and often polarizing. And since fools rush in where wise men never go, here I go. Two things on this. Now, I've spoken on this before, but it's been a very long time, and I think it fits here, and it's kind of time. Two things on this. Number one, since we live in a particular version of the kingdom of this world called a democracy that asks for our opinion, here's the word, here's the word, Give it. In other words, vote. Number two, my opinion is this. And actually, as I give this, this is my opinion, but it's not just mine, and I'm glad about that. It would be hard to do this any other way. It's where we are as a church. And where we are as a church around this is this. The homosexual behavior in general, the gay marriage in particular, misses the mark. It is hamartia, sin. But so is adultery and divorce and lust and greed and gossip and gluttony, sin. They all miss the mark badly. Indeed, and this is weird to think on, is to reflect on all of these things and how they've affected the church. In my 30 years of pastoral ministry, 26 here and 4 in a church before I came here, I have seen far more actual damage done to individuals and to the church by sins of gossip and greed, adultery, divorce and lust and homosexuality. And that isn't to minimize homosexual behavior in any way. But it's just weird. We're just so huge about that. Partly I don't know entirely. It's not our sin. We like our sins. We're familiar with them. Further, I, we, just don't believe that laws for or against any of these things. I'm not just talking about homosexuality. I'm talking about any of these things. That laws for or against any of those things have the power to protect us from those things, to change those things, transform those things, which is why as a church we want to fight battles like this in a different way, on a different field, using a different strategy, one that would actually give some evidence of a supernatural life, of a supernatural love, character, and joy, and that we would find ways to show that supernatural life and love to those that we might sometimes see as our enemy because it was while we were yet sinners. Christ did that for us and if he hadn't we'd have no hope at all there's a fascinating scene familiar to us all in the gospels actually it's in John chapter 8 that helps me kind of contextualize this a bit where Jesus is protecting and that's the appropriate word here for what he's doing with this woman a woman who's taken in adultery. Again, it's a scene that I don't even need to read the text because all of you, I'm sure, are familiar with this. And he's trying to protect her from some very righteous people who wanted to stone her, had picked up stones and felt very righteous in their throwing stones at this woman wanting to kill her for her sin. And as I think of that scene, and you can recreate it in your own mind as well, a fascinating question, I think, and a very revealing question, question, I think, is this, that you can ask yourself, that I would ask myself, with which person or with which group in that scene do you most identify? Think about that. There's people throwing stones about, very angry at this woman. Do you identify with them? Are you a stone thrower? Most of us, you know, if you grew up in Sunday school, you know they're the bad guys, so very few of us are going, yeah, that was me. Okay, you'd have to think on this a little further. Are you a stone thrower? Or do you identify a little bit more with the person about to be stoned? I would guess there's some stone throwers here. I would guess there's some people here who know very well what it feels like to be the person who's having the stone thrown at them. Or do you in any way identify with the rabbi who's saying, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you, right? You know what? I'm going to protect this woman. By the way, one of the things that's just interesting, As he's protecting this woman, his protection of her is not a condoning of adultery. He's saying, by the way, don't stone her because adultery is just fine with me. He's not saying that. In fact, he says, you know, there's a whole different way for you to live. Go and live a different way. Go and live a different way. But he protects her, not condoning what she's done. He protects her. He cares for her enough to put himself at risk for her. And I think that's the rabbi's way. what's yours interesting the way Jesus got these people to change their minds about stoning her was to get them to reflect on their own sin remember that which is something you don't want to do if you want to throw stones don't look at yourself in fact people who are very busy throwing stones generally don't try to get them to consider the log in their own eye by saying you can throw stones if you want But just let the first one who starts be the one who is absolutely without sin. So if the log has been taken out of your eye, then go ahead and throw stones at this woman. Which, again, puts me in touch with what I think is a very strange irony around this issue and our involvement in it as evangelicals that among the most vocal and active groups against gay rights and gay marriage in America are evangelical Christians, which is who we kind of are. because we care. And I'm not being sarcastic here at all. We care about and are willing to fight for the sanctity of marriage, which is a very good thing. But the irony is this, that evangelical Christians have the highest rate of divorce of any single people group in all of America, which makes me think that maybe, I don't know, but maybe, now I am being sarcastic, that maybe the best way to fight for the sanctity of marriage is to go and have a good one yourself. But not many are going to buy on for that. You know why? Because that would require a transformation. You would have to become a different kind of person. It's so much easier to pick up a stone, to make a law that would protect us from them. I sometimes wonder, who's going to protect them from us? it's all about winning it's just all about winning for so many people anyway last distinction quickly is this kingdoms of this world are by definition tribal national and therefore marked by conflict on every side in the kingdoms of this world It's always about my group, and my group is naturally the right group, the best group, and that mentality is always accompanied by an almost universal demonizing of people from a different group, the other group, be it our nationality, our country, church, denomination, or political party. Our group is the best group. Our group is the godly group, and this is where it gets a little scary. Our group is the going to heaven for sure group. We think they might be, but we're not sure. I grew up in an evangelical culture, and my home wasn't necessarily like this, but there were times early that it was a change. This grace kind of blew through my home. But I grew up in an evangelical culture that couldn't conceive of a Catholic, for instance, being a real Christian. Only Baptists were real Christians, and even then it was only certain kinds of Baptists. You know what I'm talking about. Bigger, I grew up in an evangelical culture that couldn't conceive of a Christian being a Democrat. That was a big one. Because Democrats are, well, you know. But see, what really messes you up and messed me up was when I actually began to meet some people, become friends with people who also grew up in Christian homes and they couldn't conceive of a Christian being a Republican. Because Republicans are, well, you know. The kingdom of God, on the other hand, is not tribal but universal. By that I mean this, that God doesn't have a favorite group. Sorry. He doesn't like Democrats more than Republicans, Catholics more than Baptists. He doesn't like white people more than Asians, Hispanics, or blacks. He doesn't like college-educated people more than street people, wealthy more than poor, Hindus more than Muslims, for God so loved the world that he gave everything he had, and he is not willing that any should perish, but some are perishing. So what should we do? I don't know. I don't know. How about we go to them and woo them and win them? How would we do that? I don't know how about we yell at them no wait how about wait wait we care about them how about we love them how about we make friends with them how about we invite them to our table that preach is good but that'll never work I know but it's what the rabbi did it was the rabbi's way what's yours? I love that quote by Sheldon Van Auken from his book Severe Mercy where he says that the strongest argument I've found yet for Christianity is Christians their love most of all their joy as well their certainty of things to come It's just such a sweet-smelling fragrance. But the strongest argument I've found against Christianity is also Christians, when they're self-righteous and smog and complacent consecration, when they are narrow and small, judgmental and petty, lacking love, and Christianity just dies a thousand deaths. And all of that, beloved, is at least part of why our church's vision says it this way, that our highest priority is to become the kind of people who are experiencing the love and amazing grace of God and who from that experiential knowing of his love and grace are learning to give that love and grace away indiscriminately to people who don't deserve it any more than we do. And that that's the kind of influence we want to have, a kingdom of God influence that can actually be experienced if you put down the sword, take up the cross. Fact is, however, few do. For many, upon hearing this, will maybe even withdraw from us as a church. They certainly did from Jesus. We're not walking with him anymore. May that not be said of us. And so we pray, thy kingdom come. Let's pray as we close. Would you stand with me as we close? Lord, the picture that's in my mind right now is that picture of you protecting the woman taking an adultery. I think some good work for us would be, where are we in the picture? Father, help us as we've just begun this journey with you as our rabbi and learning what it means to follow your way. Just be very attentive. Just be very attentive. Pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
