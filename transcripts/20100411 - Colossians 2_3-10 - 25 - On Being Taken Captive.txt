So I will serve you, but I'll let your sail back. In bondage to you, Lord, my heart's come alive. If it means that soon my name fades like the ending of a song, And let it be, for I was dead until you came along Oh, I'd gladly bear these chains If it means that I might see one day the whole world One day the whole world Would be set free We would be set free Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh I'm sitting down here listening to him sing that song three times, and I hope we never take for granted the gifts of the people, not just Joel, but just so many people in this church who give the gifts they've got for free to add to the life of our fellowship, our community. It's a good thing. Let's praise. We go to the ministry of the word. Father, my desire, my request is this, that you would have easy access. first of all to our minds quite frankly that we would be fully engaged give us an empowerment to really to think to deal well with the text today but also easy access to our hearts as well that we would be a people eager to obey eager to follow you and your way of living loving and I I ask this in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, open your Bibles, if you have them, to the book of Colossians, the second chapter, picking our study up in Colossians, in the third verse, where for the last several weeks, with the obvious exception of the break we took for Palm Sunday and Easter, Steve and I have been dealing with this section in the book of Colossians, these first few verses, where the Apostle Paul is declaring Jesus to be the one in whom, chapter 2, verse 3, has hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge about life and how to live it and about what the good life really is. And the reason, quite frankly, we've spent so much time on this section, actually between the two of us, between Steve and I, we've been in this little section here for a little over a month, was the same reason that Paul did, who says in Colossians 2, verse 4, that the reason I'm saying all this to you is so that no one may delude you with persuasive arguments to the contrary. Because the fact is this, beloved, that there are a lot of ideas out there relative to life and to what is the good life, many of which speak to a way of life that seems right unto a man. Said Steve, in a variety of ways, a few weeks ago, as he was quoting the writer of Proverbs, There is a way of life that seems right unto people, to a man, but the end of that way is a way that leads not to life, but it leads to death. And so Paul warns, adding his voice, as it were, to the voice of the wisdom writer in Proverbs, beginning in verse 8. Move up to verse 8 now. Here's the warning. I want you to be careful. He says it specifically this way. See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, the wisdom of the world, if you will, and not according to Christ. If you bounce back up to verse seven, I know this is kind of out of order. I just read you verse eight. Now verse seven, you actually provide some context. And what I hear in this verse is the kind of frustration someone has on behalf of someone that they love. Listen, you guys, having been rooted in and now having been built up in him, that is in Christ, and having been established in your faith, just as you were instructed and were overflowing with gratitude. Remember that? Remember that when you first came into the knowledge and the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, how grateful you were, overflowing with gratitude and how free you felt given all of that, that you've been rooted in that. See to it, verse 8, that no one takes you captive. Again, don't be deluded, don't be deceived. by false and inadequate sources of wisdom and knowledge about life and how to live it and what the good life really is, because there really is a way of life that seems right unto a man, but the end thereof leads not to life, but leads to death. And while there are many examples and manifestations of false and inadequate sources of wisdom and knowledge about life and how to live it, Very few are more seductive and powerful and deceptive than what we believe about and how we relate to money. Indeed, given the reality of the recent economic crisis that all of us in one way or another have been affected by, we've all been affected by this crisis, a crisis that many consider to be the worst since the Great Depression, very few things are more present to us than the power of money, to seduce and deceive and enslave and generate fear and anxiety on one hand, and at the same time it's generating fear and anxiety. It provides this promise to us of things that everything will be okay if you just have enough of this. But as it turns out, and this is what the economic crisis actually reveals to us, among other things, as it turns out the tradition of men and the elementary principles of the world relative to money have turned out to be a false and inadequate source of wisdom and knowledge about life and how to do life and what is the good life because all of it collapsed. And when it did, we're actually able to see some things that we couldn't see when everything was flush. And all of that is why for the next several weeks, we're going to talk about money. And by the way, By the next several weeks, what I actually mean is months. I don't know how long this is going to go. You kind of know how it is here. We kind of break into something like this, and it really is how it works. We kind of bust into something. We really feel like we need to talk about this, and we're just going to let this go as long as it needs to go. And we're going to come at this thing from a number of different directions, including this one, first of all. And this is very important. I'm sure I'm going to visit this one again. It feels very, very important to say this. And that is, first thing, to acknowledge right out of the box that in many ways, many of us, maybe all of us, have already been, in a variety of ways, taken captive through the philosophy and empty deception of what the world calls wisdom relative to money. Indeed, as I was thinking about this early in the week and anticipating not only this message, but whatever it is that's going to follow this message with Steve's preaching and my preaching, and I'm really sure that I'm speaking for Steve in this arena, for me to preach this, for us to preach this with the kind of freedom and boldness that I think we have to have around this issue. I cannot do it. Anita can conceive from a lofty perch as if I see this thing from my elevated position as being a problem for you and not for me, as if I've not been taken captive and I've not been deceived. Yes, I have been taken captive and also been deceived in ways I don't even know. And we all have in ways we don't even know. What do you mean we don't know? You've been deceived. That's the nature of deception. When you are deceived, you don't know you're deceived. So here's my hope here, is that we might all actually enter into this with that same kind of spirit. a willingness to go, God, show us the ways we have been deceived and taken captive and aren't aware of it even right now, because we have hearts to obey and to follow, and it's my desire that we do that and see ourselves as maybe not just individually, but as a community, feeling a little responsible for each other, to be in this thing together, in a kind of Egypt, if you will, Egypt being a symbol of God's people being in a place of slavery. And as it relates to economics, our own financial situation, some of us are more enslaved than others, but let's just say all of us are to some level deceived by and captivated by these kinds of things. But here's the vision that together as a community of faith, we might begin to leave that place. Some of you around your finances, particularly because of the economic crisis, you were hanging by a thread, and then the crisis comes and the thread is broken and there is an incredible amount of fear around your finances. Some of you, I don't want to open your mail because it's just going to be another bill. On top of that is shame. And you know what? There just needs to be bucket loads of grace because we've got to crawl out of this hole and we've got to recognize the ways we've been deceived and been made captive and walk out of this thing together. Ready? Let's go. Second thing I want to acknowledge kind of as a baseline here, something we're going to build on and kind of build as groundwork. it's this, that money isn't evil in and of itself and neither is wealth. The Bible says the love of money is at the root of all sorts of evil, but money itself is entirely neutral and as such can be used for good or for evil. You know this is true. It can be used to bless or to curse, to build up or to tear down. So money isn't evil and neither is wealth. But it is dangerous. It is dangerous and we need wisdom around this kind of thing. And some, noting the danger of money and wealth, though it isn't evil in and of itself, some, 1 Timothy 6, 10, Paul says, by longing for it, have actually wandered away from the faith and pierce themselves with many a pang. And it's at least part of why Paul says to Timothy in 1 Timothy 6, 17, to instruct those who are rich in this present world to feel real bad about that. No, no, to not be arrogant or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches. But I'm God who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy. So hear me, it's not wrong to enjoy your wealth. Just kind of get that settled. We'll return to that if we have to, but mammon is a seductive force that we have identified here at Open Door in the past. We've talked about this before in the past, mammon being a spiritual force that Jesus mentions in among other places, places like Matthew 6 where he says, you cannot serve God and mammon. Some of your Bibles translate mammon as money. We've taught this around here long enough to understand that mammon actually isn't money. Mammon is actually a spirit. It's a spiritual force behind money. Money itself can be used for good or for evil. When mammon gets attached to money, however, it has a job. And mammon's primary job relative to money is to get you and me to believe that money is not just a resource, but that it's a source of life and joy and peace and security. And if you believe that, that money really is a source of life, you will pursue it as if it has the power to give you life. Not just pursue it, you will grasp it and hoard it and serve it. You will maybe even steal it if it's a source of life. I have to have it. You'll certainly worship it. ultimately becoming a slave to it, having been taken captive. Now we're back to the text, Colossians 2, verse 8. Having been taken captive by the empty deception of the traditional thinking, if you will, of men and the elementary principles of the world, empowered by a spiritual force in the world called mammon. And all of that ultimately manifests itself as nothing more and nothing less than idolatry. It's idolatry. Indeed, Richard Foster in his book, Money, Sex, and Power, says this, that when Jesus declares in Matthew 6 that you cannot serve God and mammon, he is personifying mammon as a rival God. He is making it unmistakably clear that when mammon is involved, money is no longer a neutral medium of exchange because mammon is a spirit that has power. Power to inspire and then to demand great devotion and high levels of sacrifice, like gods often do. But whose ultimate aim is to dominate and devour and even to kill. Kill? Sounds kind of extreme. Until the stock market crashes and people literally die. A couple weeks ago, I read a book by a guy named Timothy Keller entitled The Counterfeit Gods. It's a book I highly recommend. You might want to tap into it even when we're in this series. Subtitled The Empty Promises of Money, Sex, and Power. And he opened it with a series of stories that he found on a website. The website is called thecopycateffect.com. And I dialed into that. And here's the good news. If I can find this, so can you. Yeah. Thecopycateffect.com. And what it was about was about how after the economic crisis in the middle of 2008, there followed a tragic string of suicides among formerly wealthy and well-connected individuals. The acting chief financial officer of Freddie Mac, which is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, hanged himself in his basement. Chief executive of Sheldon Good, a leading U.S. real estate auction firm, shot himself in the head behind the wheel of his Red Jaguar. Which is kind of ironic. French money manager who lost $1.4 billion of his client's money in a Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme, slit his wrists and died there in his Madison Avenue office. And when a Bear Stearns executive learned that he would not be hired by J.P. Morgan Chase, which had bought his collapse firm, He took a drug overdose and leapt from the 29th floor of his office building. And a friend who knew that guy, of that guy, said that Bear Stearns thing just broke his spirit. Keller, to that, then said this. There is a difference between sorrow and despair. So sorrow is pain for which there are resources of, there are sources of consolation. Sorrow comes from losing one thing, one good thing among others, so that if you do experience a career reversal, you will feel sorrow, great sorrow. But you can find comfort in other things, like friends you hold dear, and the love of your family. Despair, however, is inconsolable, because it comes from losing what was to you the ultimate, whoa, thing. And when you lose what has become for you the ultimate source of life, and meaning and hope. There are no alternative sources to turn to, so it breaks your spirit. Because mammon is a seductive force whose primary job it is to get you and me to believe that money is not just a resource to be enjoyed, but a source of life, joy, and peace, and security. it's called idolatry and as I tell these stories it reminds me of the haunting words of the prophet Isaiah just some context here Isaiah is kind of frustrated and he's dealing with the people of God and he's continually calling the people of God he's not calling the world he's calling God's people to find life in the only source of life that is reliable come and get your life from God but they constantly would nod their heads and maybe say amen in the synagogue, but then go and get life from other things, from other sources of life. So in frustration, it's almost like he says in Isaiah 57, 13, fine, but here's the deal. When you cry out in your day of calamity, let your collection of idols deliver you. But they can't deliver you because they are by nature false gods, false sources of life, which is why eventually, it says in Isaiah 57, 13, the wind will carry all of them up and a breath will take them all away. And when that happens, people will jump out of 29 story buildings because mammon doesn't want to just enslave you. It wants to kill you if it can. What about idolatry? Because idolatry, even just the word itself, kind of conjures up images for people like us of primitive people, of people who worship rocks and sticks and bowing down to statues, which is really kind of weird. Fact is, though, all through the Old Testament and New Testament, there are vivid descriptions of those very things, people who would bow down to statues and rocks and sticks and things like that. But particularly, it got a little more sophisticated in Paul's day when he was writing to the Colossians. In this ancient Greco-Roman world, every city, including Colossae, worshipped its favorite deities. And they would name them, and they would build shrines around their images for worship when Paul went to Athens. For instance, in Acts 17, verse 16, it says that his spirit was provoked within him. He was just agitated. The kind of provocation that kind of keeps you up at night. I don't know what to do about this because he found this city full of idols. And if you try to picture what was that like and what was he talking about, We picture, I do anyway, these ancient temples and shrines and statues that people apparently were bowing down to, which all sounds very bizarre to us. And it is true, they were like that. The Parthenon of Athena in Athens overshadowed everything. It was the biggest structure there, but there was also Aphrodite, not only in Athens, but this goddess would have been known in Colossae as well. Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty. There was Eris, the god of war. Artemis, the goddess of fertility and wealth. Hephaestus, the god of craftsmanship. And all of that, to us, sounds strange. Very primitive, obviously pagan. We would spot that. But Keller suggests, and I agree, that these ancient cultures are not that different from our own. It might present itself a little differently. The fact, however, is this. Every culture in every age, including ours, is dominated by its own set of idols. Each has its priesthoods, its totems, its rituals. Each one has its shrines and its temples, whether office towers or spas or gyms, studios or stadiums. And sacrifices must be made. It's just incredible. In order to procure the blessings of what? The good life. And ward off disaster. Think with me. So what are the gods? In our day of beauty, what are the gods of beauty, of power, money, achievements, if they aren't the same things that have assumed mythic proportions? Anything that assumes mythic proportions in our individual lives and in our culture. Bring it a little closer to home. See, here's the deal. We may not ever, and we won't ever, physically kneel before the statue of Aphrodite. How bizarre. How bizarre. But countless young women today are driven into depression and eating disorders by an obsessive concern over their body, how they look. What's that about? You see, when I put it in that perspective, now all of a sudden Paul's words in Acts 16 about his spirit being provoked when he sees idols everywhere takes on a whole new meaning to me because the reason God's people were always being called from idols wasn't because it was not the long bony finger, I just don't like you to have any fun. These things will kill you. Last night after the talk, I met with a woman who was affected by this connection of Aphrodite and idolatry to an eating disorder and she talked about her daughter and she said, my daughter, lovely gal, has been rooted and built up in the faith. She knows Jesus and has loved her since a little child but growing up in Southern California, you just get caught up. You just caught up in the stuff and before we almost lost her to an eating disorder and she's been delivered but this is fighting for people's lives here. See we may not actually burn incense to Artemis How bizarre But when money and career are raised to cosmic proportions We perform a kind of child sacrifice Neglecting family and community to achieve a higher place in business And gain more wealth and prestige We're willing to sacrifice a lot Where's the line? Where's the line? Where's the line? That's the fight. David Brooks, in a recent article for the New York Times, recent couple years, March 14, 2008, was reflecting on this Eliot Spitzer guy. I remember him, the governor of New York at the time, who destroyed his career and I think his marriage with his involvement in a high-priced prostitution ring. David Brooks noted this, kind of reflecting on him and others like him, quoting here, how our culture has produced a class of very high achievers with what he called rank-link imbalances. Now, I wanted that word on the screen so you could see it. He kind of made up this word, kind of a disease that he's identified called rank-link imbalances. And what it means is these people have social skills for vertical relationships that improve their rank with mentors and bosses, but they have no skill for genuine bonding and horizontal relationships with spouses or friends or family. So with this rank-link imbalance, they have a lot of skill for vertical relationships, and basically how that looks in more common language. I become very skilled in relationships with people, but I'm always using people. My relationship with you would be entirely predicated on how I could use you to help me advance. And there is in that a kind of wisdom. See, some people would go, well, of course, that's just how the game is played. Well, there's your wisdom right there. for example then Brooks goes on he says this countless presidential candidates say they're running on behalf of their families even though their entire lives are spent on the campaign trail away from their families and and you know those dirty rotten guys politicians all of them actually when I read that little thing I actually thought of people like me pastors like me, who in the name of serving God are actually driven by a need to succeed. But they're serving God, so who's going to confront that? And they end up with all the same kind of junk. The idolatry takes all these different forms, but it has always the same results. And as the years go by, says Brooks, they come to the sickening realization that their grandeur was not near enough to feed their soul and they are alone. Alienated from their children and their spouses, they seek to heal the hurt, to medicate the pain, variety of ways, often having affairs. Then comes the breakdown of the family and it happens over and over and over and over again with a monotonous kind of regularity. Bottom line, they had sacrificed everything to the God of success in this case, but it wasn't enough. Final quote, I want this on the screen so you can see it. In ancient days, the deities were bloodthirsty and hard to appease, they still are. And all of that is why Paul says what he says. All of a sudden, these words take kind of a much more familiar and contemporary ring. Paul says what he says in Colossians 2, verse 8, when he says, see to it, you guys, that no one takes you captive. I'm fighting for your life here through the empty deception of human wisdom, which is the tradition of men and the elementary principles of the world rather than Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge about life and how to live it and what is the good life. I mean, for goodness sake, that's my paraphrase of verse 7, having been rooted in and built up in him, established in the faith. Don't be deluded. don't be deceived by false and inadequate sources of wisdom and knowledge about life and how to live it about what the good life really is because there really is a way of life that seems right unto a man but the path thereof leads not to life but to death and i am trying to save you says paul in colossians chapter 2 but the real problem with any deception is that we don't know that it's happening when it's happening. We don't know that it's already happened when it's already happened. That is the fundamental nature of a deception. It's quite so dangerous. And having been deceived, what we need at that point is something to wake us up, something to help us see. Because if we don't see it, I mean, you could have a great heart, a real eagerness even to obey and to follow Jesus, But if you don't see the issue, you will never do anything about it. And quite possibly, even with a really good heart, quite possibly live as a slave your whole life long and not even know it. I mean, just think of the people in Egypt. I wonder if at any point they got used to it. It's just the way life is. Just don't even think about it more or the ways in which we're enslaved and need to be set free and walk out of this thing together. So in the time we have left this morning, I want to try to illustrate that a bit so that maybe we can begin to see some of the ways that we've been deceived and taken captive by money, more specifically even by mammon, whose job it is, like any false god, not only to enslave you, but even to kill you if it can. And to do that, I want to give you some history, some economic history, being the expert of economic history as I am. Truth is, I'm indebted to my good friend Greg Boyd, who I recently heard run through what I'm about to run through with you in a series of sermons he was doing on kingdom economics, and he began with this fact, that the Western world didn't always operate on what we know today as being capitalism. Indeed, for well over a thousand years, the economic system of the West, and I'm talking Western Europe here, was that of feudalism, a thing called feudalism. In that system, most peasants who made up 98% of the population would spend their lives working the land, and the land was called a manor. The owner of the land was called a feudal lord. He was often a prince or a king. Here's how it worked. The peasants would work the land for the owner of the land, the prince or the king, and then would give to this feudal lord, prince or king, a good portion of its yield, a very large portion of its yield, because it was his land. But there was a deal in this, and he got something for it. In exchange for that, they would get to live on the land for generations, actually. They would have a place to live and raise their family, and they also got the protection from the king. Now, a system like that is obviously ripe for corruption. If the king, for instance, is greedy or selfish, he can make life absolutely miserable for the peasants. But if the king is good, and there were good kings, he could actually make the life for the peasants good, at least not bad. And even sometimes there were kings and feudal lords who saw as wise, and it was, to have a distribution of the wealth and really share with them and bring their lifestyle to a better place. But in either case, good king, bad king, the peasants were stuck. There was no concept of upward mobility. This is the way it has been. This is the way it will always be. Indeed, most peasants were born and lived and died in the same plot of land. And there are some upsides to that. One would be you had a sense of stability. You had some roots for generations. Your family worked this land. Downside, no control at all. There were wars in those days, obviously. And if the king, the feudal lord who gave you protection, lost a battle, you would be out. If the king was selfish, you would be out. So people in the system would find their motivation, their sense of significance, not by looking to the future, because it's going to get better, you know, and we're just going to keep on hanging in it because it's going to get better. They would find their sense of significance by looking to the past and take comfort in the fact that my great-grandfather and my grandfather and my father and my sons and my daughters and my sons and daughters, sons and daughters will live on this land and work this place. Now, that system was pretty much in place till the Renaissance, 13th, 14th centuries, When for a variety of reasons, things began to change. Some of the things that made the change were good and some of them were bad because a lot of what created the change was revolution where the peasants would go, I'm going to kill you, and they would kill the king and everything would be better then. But as this change began to happen, people began to desire things they'd never thought of desiring before, like a better life now. So they moved off their land and people were suddenly able to purchase their own land, often learn a trade, become their own boss, earn their own money, which is all a very good thing. But at the beginning in particular, but it still is now, how do you start? If you've been a peasant, you've never owned a thing. How do you start? Where do you get money? Where do you get the capital to start your own thing? Well, one of the ways it happened, and this just started real small, obviously, at the beginning, was wealthy people who had the money would loan the money to the peasants to start out. And they would charge him interest on this loan. And at that level, it's a great deal. It is absolutely a win-win proposition. The peasant has an opportunity to build a life that they never dreamt about. The wealthy person has a chance to help somebody else, which feels really good, but also to make money off their money, which is a really good thing. It's fine. Indeed, this was, and again, I'm giving you really a quick buzz over here. It's kind of the advent of capitalism. Called that because it produces capital. It produces wealth. and it's a great system. Lots of upside. Because built into it, I think you know, is incentive to work hard. I mean, a peasant working someone else's land might work hard, but his incentive is, he won't kill me, so I'll work hard. It doesn't last real long. It's not a great motivator, but now, if I can really improve my life and improve my family's life, you've got incentive now built into that to work hard, ingenuity, creativity, inventiveness, resourcefulness, Because all of that gets rewarded in this kind of system, not part of the feudal system. So the first time people, this word was never, you know, in their minds, upward mobility, that I could change it for my future and for my family. That was not even on the radar screen for anybody. But all of this, even good stuff around this, raises questions. And these are questions we need to ask as kingdom people. Questions like this. How as kingdom people, do we live in a capitalistic system? How do we do that? And here's another question. What are the unique ways that mammon would manifest itself in capitalism? Let's just say capitalism is great. But if we're going to be kingdom people, we need to be very wise about ways in which mammon would manifest itself in capitalism. If we were living in socialism or communism, pick an ism, okay? You might go, it's really good, it's really bad. I don't care. Here's the question. As kingdom people, in whatever ism you are living in, Here's what we have to grapple with. How do kingdom people live in that system? And to answer that question, I've got to be wise to the ways mammon, if I was living in socialism, how does mammon manifest itself in that system? How does it manifest itself in communism? How does this manifest itself in capitalism? I need to know. This is our work around this. Interesting. To get at that a little bit. The word credit actually comes from a Latin word to believe or to trust. And what you're trusting in when you enter into credit is actually two things. First of all, you're trusting the person you're dealing with. If you're loaning the money, you're trusting that they're going to pay you back. If you're borrowing the money, you're trusting that the person loaning you the money is not going to charge an exorbitant interest rate and kind of rip you off that way. But the other thing you're trusting in, and this is the big one, You are trusting in the future that it's going to get better and better and better be. And so because you trust in the future, you put confidence in the future, you realize that I can't afford it now, but I will afford it later on. So I borrow now, believing, because I have trust in the future, that I will have it then. And at certain levels, that's a great thing. Because it can create a better future. I mean, these peasants couldn't have ever bought land unless someone believed in them, trusted in them, and they all trusted in the future that they would be able to pay it back. So it creates a better future, and it also creates a better now, because they actually have their own land now. And again, when it all works well, and people don't get greedy, and people don't get dishonest, it can be a win-win situation. But now fast forward it just a bit. The Industrial Revolution pumped all sorts of life into this thing. but it wasn't actually until the turn of the century, the 20th century that this thing just exploded. Greg called it capitalism on steroids which kind of sounds like Greg. And then there were two things that kind of really had a profound effect in this thing just, this capitalism thing just taking root. First was this, an unprecedented economic boom after the Second World War and that economic boom that was stimulated by a number of things I don't have time to go into now created, among other things, confidence in what? The future, right? Which is good, it's good. The things will get better and better. So I will borrow now, believing that I'll have it then. Win-win situation. But it created little things. Again, how does mammon manifest itself? It created whole new definitions of wisdom relative to money. like it used to be, you'd have to ask this question, can I afford it? Which meant, can I pay for it? Now you don't even ask that question. It's more, this is the question. I don't ask if I can pay for it. I ask if I can afford the monthly what? Payments. Which I'm not even saying is evil or bad. I'm saying that's new. It's created a whole new kind of what passes for really wise choices. Second thing that really affected this economic, this boom of capitalism was the advent of TV. It's evil. No, no. Along with TV came, among other things, advertising. Designed, as you know, to convince us to consume things we don't need, to buy things we can't afford. And it was all quite intentional. Designed to create a society of consumers because the entire economy now is built on and dependent on this perpetual cycle of consumption. We have to keep doing that. Indeed, some months ago, we talked about this in the context of the Sermon on the Mount, the very specific strategy that was kind of unveiled in the 1950s of number one, what was called planned obsolescence. Remember this? And the second thing, the second strategy to get this machine of our economy really humming was called perceived obsolescence. Now, planned obsolescence, I think you know what that is. It has to do with actually intentionally designing goods and services or designing products that were designed to kind of wear out pretty quickly so that you would have to buy a new one. And in the continual cycle of buying more, the machine grows and continues to pick up steam. But after that, it was like we would like to really ramp this up even more to get this machine going even stronger. And so they entered into, and this is very intentional, what was called perceived obsolescence. And this is where the advertising thing comes in, designed to get people to buy new stuff when the old stuff was just fine. And on the front end, who would do that? we will just kind of breed discontent we will convince you that you're just not okay unless you have this and you have an old one but now you need a new one or it's out of date or it's the wrong color, it's the wrong style and on and on and on and we're so very used to all of this until lines however are entirely blurred and this is how deception happens this is how we get deceived and don't know we've been deceived because the lines get entirely blind entirely blurred between wants and needs. Literally can't tell the difference. And we just have to have it, and we have to have it when? Now. So we borrow now, believing we'll have it then, believing the future will get better and better and better, all of which has led to an entirely new version of wisdom around money. but it's a wisdom according to the tradition of men according to the elementary principles of the world and not Christ one simple example max out your credit card what do you do? I'm all worried oh man I don't know how to pay this thing off it's really scary they're starting to write these threatening letters how do I pay off my credit card? I know I know this is brilliant I'll get another credit card and pay off the first credit card with the second credit card but when I pay off that first credit card my credit rating actually went up So with my second credit card, I got more to put on the card, and I did. And now I'm all worried again, because I don't know how in the world to pay off this second credit card, because it's all maxed out, and I have no else to do another third credit card. And this might sound insane to you, but people do this. And the truth is, you can do that for a while. And you're maybe in your mind thinking, oh, what stupid person, our whole country has done this. But here's the problem. Eventually, it catches up with you. And eventually, that cycle I just described to you did catch up with us. It's called the economic crisis of 2008, a crisis that with all the trouble it has caused and the fear that it has generated and anxiety among all of us, even in this room, might be bringing with it an incredible opportunity for the people of God. for us in this room to think about how we've been living, to stop and think about how we've been deceived and taken captive, become slaves by what's been passing for the wisdom of men and the elementary principles of the world rather than Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge about life and how to do life and what is the good life. And we all say and have been saying for over a month, amen. But money? Jesus and money? Fact is, Jesus talked about money more than he talked about any other single thing, more than heaven or hell, more than love or forgiveness, more than anger and pride, lust and salvation. Jesus talked about drachmas and shekels and talents and gold. So we're going to talk about it too. And we're picking it up right there next week. But let me close with this. Kind of looping back to what I said at the very beginning. Let's start with this. Let's just acknowledge together. We've all been deceived. And in a variety of ways. lesser and greater degrees, we've all been taken captive. And a deception is in ways we don't even know. And I know for a fact, partly because of the economic crisis, that has affected us all. Some of you have lost jobs. Some of you are in financial holes. You are scared to death about it. You don't know how to get out of it. I know that some of you, you hate opening your mail because of what it's saying to you every time you have to do it. And in a variety of ways we are in Egypt. And here's the word, open door. It's time to walk out of Egypt. But we want to do it together. Let's do it together. If some of you are doing really well, you're not above this. Let's be in this thing together and walk out of this Egypt together into a good and spacious land where we can be free from this thing and do it together. Amen? Amen. Let's stand and close in prayer. Father I pray that you would be the God of this journey for us and we've talked about these things before and even often but there is a new kind of urgency because we're all smelling this thing and the deception of it and the slavery of it and I pray for us I pray that you would even stir up gifts among us there are people who have great wisdom around this and I pray that you would call them out and help us and others are in deep holes and have no hope at all. And I pray in the name of Jesus, you would just be beginning to use us as a community, not just these sermons, but us as a community in relationship with one another to help each other out of our Egypt, whatever that thing might be, so we can live in a good and spacious land, so we can breathe again and sleep at night. Holy Spirit, come. Thy kingdom come to this, we pray. And all God's people said, amen. God bless you as you leave. you
