Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. So God, here we are, and thank God here you are. No matter where we have come from leading into today, whether our lives are a complete wreck or whether we're doing okay, the truth is we all need you. And we need to meet you and we need to hear from you. So Holy Spirit, come. Father in heaven, please speak. Amen. Well, we are still in the book of Colossians, chapter 3, verse 16. So open your Bibles if you have them. You can use your iPads or Kindles or iPhones or Droids or whatever you have that have a Bible on them. Please feel free to do that. Colossians 3.16, I'm going to read this verse to you. We've been in it for approximately, I don't know, Dave, eight weeks maybe. Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through songs, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. And two weeks ago, Dave started talking about the Holy Spirit, and he sort of jumped to the parallel passage that Paul wrote in Ephesians 5, in which we basically read the same things. And I don't know if that meant just Paul loved what he wrote in Colossians so much that he felt like, man, the Ephesians need to hear this too. I want to mix it around a little bit so it doesn't look exactly the same. But these are good thoughts, so why waste them. We're going to do it again. So Ephesians 5, 18 and 19, this is the way he says it. Don't get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery or dissipation, which is in Dave's translation that you've read the last couple weeks. Instead, be filled with the Spirit. That's how he says to the Ephesians, let the word of Christ dwell in you richly. Same concept. Speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. And that just makes you, like, what would it look like to speak to one another with songs from the Spirit? That's interesting. That's an interesting question. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord. And so Dave, for the last two weeks, has talked about the character and nature of the Holy Spirit, and in particular, the gifts that the Holy Spirit brings. And last week, Dave talked about the Holy Spirit as someone, that person you know, that shows up to the party always bringing something. You know that person, right? It doesn't matter if you ask them to bring something, they're bringing a thing full of meatballs, and they put it right in your your kitchen. And they think, well, everyone can use meatballs. You need meatballs. Here we go. I'm coming. I'm bringing gifts. That's what I do. And that's what the Holy Spirit does. The Holy Spirit comes bringing gifts for the church so that they can carry out the works of God in the world. That's the purpose of the gifts, to encourage us, to give us the power to do what only, what we can only do through the power of God. And so what I want to talk about this morning is what does it look like to be filled with the Holy Spirit in terms of listening to the whispers of God's voice in your life? Does God still speak to you and me in 2011? Does God still whisper? And so I would pose that to you. Can you remember a time where maybe you felt the nudge from God to do something or the voice of God encouraging you or maybe even correcting you or telling you you need to go back to that person and apologize or saying, you are my beloved daughter. I love you with an everlasting love. And maybe you don't have a lot of language for that. Maybe for you it's like, no, there was just this time where I just knew I had to do something. And so I did it, and something crazy happened. You didn't even know that you got a word from God, but you did. Oh, that's what that is. I remember a time about 10 years ago, and Mary and I were sitting in a hotel room. It was late at night. We were in California. I was interviewing for a job at this big church that I thought was just the place for me. And we were thinking about going there, and we were very excited, or at least I was very excited. and the interviews that day had gone well. There was about 75 of them, as I remember. And so we turned out the light after talking for a while and I'm sure talking for a while meant I talked for a while about how excited I was. And after a little few moments of silence, I heard Mary crying. You know, we lived in Minnesota and we're thinking about moving to California and she's from Minnesota, lived there her whole life. And so my first thought was, great. She's going to screw this whole thing up. I'm not kidding. That's exactly what I thought. But then in that moment, and during that time, I had been reading some books about what it meant to be a man and what it meant to be a man in these books was to follow your dreams and to go for it and make a big impact in the world. So I thought, this is what I'm doing. And in that moment, I felt God whisper to me this word, and I'll never forget it. Steve, if you want to be a real man, you will turn on the light and talk to your wife right now. Because I love this woman very much. And that was my reaction right there. See, when you don't work from a script, that's the kind of thing you can do. No, anyway, I really did fight for a second of saying, oh, no, really, come on, what? And then I just thought, no, no, no, no, no, no. This I'm doing. And so I turned on the light and we talked. And you know, we didn't end up going to that church, but that was a significant moment for our marriage that had nothing to do with a job promotion. Something happened in our marriage at that moment. So does God speak? Does God speak to you? I remember another time, this was just a few months ago, I was working on a talk to give here. It was a Thursday morning, I remember it. And all of a sudden, boom, this couple came into my mind. And the word was, you need to go ask for forgiveness because you were extremely arrogant to them. And in that moment, it wasn't, I didn't fight. I was like, yep, you're right. Absolutely. You are absolutely right. And when I get prompts like that, you have to act right away. And so I did. I emailed right away. Because if you wait 24 hours, you know what happens in 24 hours? I don't really need to call. It wasn't really God. God doesn't speak like that. And they were kind of mean to me too anyway, you know, and all that stuff. And so, you know, we set up a meeting, and it was sweet. It was a sweet time where I could just say, listen, would you forgive me? And they were like, absolutely. And it was really cool. So, I want to tell you a story found in Acts chapter 9. very familiar story the first half of it anyway the second half is not so familiar so i'll tell the first half a little more quickly acts chapter 9 starting in verse 1 story of saul who turns into paul but we pick up the story when we read meanwhile saul was breathing out murderous threats against the lord's disciples which if you're the lord's disciples that's awesome right awesome breathing out murderous threats killing many people killed stephen okay so you're you're a little afraid at this point. And Saul went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogue in Damascus so that if he found anyone there who belonged to the way, which was a little group of Jesus followers, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. But as Saul neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him, and he fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? Like, you know, that happens to us every day, right? Well, he hit the ground, but he had a question. Okay, who are you that's speaking to me? Because Saul had been working out of the frame of reference that everything he was doing was for God. He was protecting the name of God from this heretical band of followers of Jesus that were going to wreck everything. He was doing it in his own mind for God. He was defending God. Have you ever met anyone like that? Have you ever done anything like that? Well, the answer that Saul got was this. I'm Jesus, whom you are persecuting. But it doesn't end there. It's really interesting what happens next. He says, now get up and go into the city of Damascus, and there you'll be told what you must do. Now Saul, question, what is he not used to? Taking orders. So Saul, I want you to get up. He's blind at this point. he needs to be led into the city and I want you to wait and then you will be told what to do. He doesn't even say who's going to tell him. But Saul, in his first act of courageous obedience as a follower of Jesus, says yes. And the results are a church is formed which we're a part of to this day. But, the truth is that is not even the coolest part of the story. Let's read on. Acts 9, verse 10, in Damascus, there was this nobody disciple named Ananias. Now the Lord called to him in a vision and he said his name, Ananias. To which Ananias said, yes, Lord. Another translation says, here I am, Lord. Yes, Lord. Present. Listening. Antenna up. Go ahead and speak. And Ananias apparently had a rhythm of life where he, when he got a whisper from God, could recognize it and say, okay, go ahead. So the Lord told him, go to the house of Judas on Straight Street. I love this. Like, have you ever gotten anything like that? Listen, I want you to go to Costco. At Costco, you will find a woman dressed in red and wearing, you know, an overcoat. No. But, nonetheless, this happens. Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street. Straight Street. Like, there's only one street. You know, it's straight. It's anyway. And ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, which is also funny, because, like, everyone knew who Saul was. Everyone was afraid of Saul coming to Damascus. Everyone had heard that Saul was coming to Damascus to kill Christians. And so when the Lord says, ask for a man— Now, I don't know if you've heard, but a man from Tarsus named Saul. Right. I know who he is. In a vision, Saul has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight. So Jesus is telling Ananias, you're going to go and put your hands on public enemy number one, the person who hates you, the person who you hate, and you're going to pray that the Holy Spirit would fill him and restore his sight. Question. Think of public enemy number one in your mind. What if the Lord asked you to go and pray for that person, putting your hands on them so that they would be filled with the Spirit? What would your response be? You might have some but in there. Yeah, but, I mean, that's a good idea, Lord. I mean, don't get me wrong. I mean, I think that's probably a good thing, but I got—right? Well, Ananias does it too, which is so human. I love the scriptures in part because it's filled with human responses. He didn't just go, yes, I will go. He says, Lord, now, funny thing, I don't know if you've read the papers lately, but I've heard many reports about this man and all the harm that he has done to your people, of whom I am one, in Jerusalem, and now he's in Damascus. Now he's come here with authority from the chief priest to arrest all those who call on your name. And so the Lord said to Ananias, oh man, I know you're scared. No. He just said, Ananias, go. And Ananias went. When he got to the house on Straight Street, he saw Saul. He placed his hands on him. Saul was filled with the Holy Spirit. And the rest is literally history. Saul became Paul. He started the church, of which we are a part. But back up to that moment where Ananias was mowing the lawn. That's how it works, right? Type in an email. Cooking broccoli. And all of a sudden, the Lord comes and says, Ananias, go. And Ananias went. Even though you know he was thinking this, right? There's no way God is going to send me to the public enemy number one. I mean, that's not how God works. Have you ever said that? That's not how God works. Just, if you ever find yourself thinking that, that's just a good check right there. Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Here's the deal. Here's what we can learn from the story of Saul and Ananias. God really does speak. God speaks to God's church. And people listen and respond, and it's usually small. Little things. Yeah, I'll go to that person and say I'm sorry. And then, as a result of people simply responding to the whispers of God, big things happen. That God does, not you. All I do is respond. That's my role. Respond. Just respond. Listen and respond. Now, the problem is, we've all met this person, right? Hey, God told me, and it's just filled with bravado, and it's Saul heading down to Damascus. The agenda, God told me to stamp all you guys out. God told me to kill this group of people. That's happened countless times in Christian history. God told me, and then it's all, it just feels wrong when you hear that. Have you ever experienced something like that where God told me, and then, whoa, you're just backing up, and it's like you're getting beat up. But my fear is because we've experienced that so many times, the temptation is then to say, well, let's not get too worked up about trying to hear from God because it's crazy, and we're just going to get to that crazy place, and we can't trust it. And we've all been there. We've all heard it. We've all heard the crazy people. So let's just not even go there. And if we don't go there, my fear is that we will never, never be empowered to do what God wants us to do in the world. And we won't hear what we need to hear. Amen? So let's hold that intention. Yeah, some people who say, God told me, it's not God. It really isn't. but that doesn't mean that God doesn't speak. So how does God speak? Let's get really practical. I think in my experience and my reading of the scriptures, there's kind of three broad categories and I know there's more but these are three of the broad categories. Sometimes God gives whispers of direction, something that God wants you to do. Sometimes God gives whispers of correction, hey, you were wrong. When the prophet Nathan confronted David about Bathsheba, that was a word from God of correction. Sometimes and many times, they're whispers of encouragement. And so in my studying this week, I got to Thursday afternoon and I was freaking out a little bit because there wasn't really any material other than this idea of I think God speaks. And so I wrote an email to the Open Door members. It's through your door. And if you're a member of Open Door, I can email you or anyway. So I emailed this email saying, if you've ever gotten a prompting from God, and if you've done something about it, or even didn't do something about it, could you email me back and tell me? And so, you know, when I sent, when I clicked send, I was kind of freaked out because I'm like, oh man, like, what if no one responds? That would be a big tragedy because I would lose hope in the church completely. But even worse, what if only crazy people respond, you know? Yeah, I've heard from God, Steve. You're a terrible preacher, and I wish you would leave. God told me, you know. Okay, that would be great. Well, within 24 hours, I got about 100 emails back. And I mean, I read every one of them. And they were all the most amazing stories, little and big, of God moving in the hearts of God's people here at Open Door. It was unbelievable. So I want to read a couple to you, if that's all right. Is that all right? Yes. Okay. So this one is kind of the most bizarre one, but I love it. It's what I would call a whisper of direction. So he writes this, A still voice spoke to me once and told me that a family was in need of food, and I didn't have any money, and all I had was enough— all I had enough gas for was to get me to work that week to and from. So I prayed, asking God what to do, since I didn't have the money and really didn't have the gas even to drive out to this family's home. And again, the still voice spoke, and this time it told me to take the food in my kitchen and take it to the family. I thought, well, maybe God wanted me to fast. Love that. And if I didn't have enough gas for work, I guess I'd be walking for a few days to work until I got paid. So I packed up all the food in my house, about three bags of groceries, and I saw this guy this morning, and I was like, you really did this? Can you imagine packing up all the food in your house? Three bags of groceries headed to the family's home that God told me about. When I got there, I found the family had two young kids and no food in the house. When I brought the groceries in, they were amazed as to what had happened. We prayed and rejoiced as the moving of God and answered their prayers, but God wasn't finished. During this time, God also spoke to a member in the church I was attending, and when I got home, they were waiting for me with a couple of bags of groceries and a $20 bill, so I had gas money for the week, he said. You know, it's like, what? That doesn't happen. No, that doesn't happen, right? Here's another little direction. It was Sunday afternoon when I heard this nagging, when I felt this nagging feeling that I should call my friend. I brushed it off because we had just talked at length following church. I took a nap, and after waking up, I still had this nagging feeling that I needed to call her, So I did. And she answered the phone with, funny you should call. She was just leaving the ER. She had an oil fire in her apartment that afternoon and had burned both of her hands. She was comforted with concern, and I was comforted to know that I wasn't crazy. You know, that's cool. Okay, a couple notes of encouragement. This is from one of my friends. I love this one. And she writes this. Okay, I have a silly little Holy Spirit story, which are my favorite. Growing up on the farm, I listened daily to cows mooing, horses neighing, and our dogs barking. By far the most memorable sound came when the farm was quiet and I could hear the cooing of a mourning dove. I didn't realize how much that sound calmed me until moving to the city where that sound came few and far between. So listen, in my busy little neighborhood, I have been befriended by a pair of mourning doves. There have been many times when I am overwhelmed by mothering duties, lack of sleep, lack of adult companionship, or frustration with all of the above, and I'll step outside my house and there are those two little birds and they're cooing at me. They drown out every other noise. They're always perched on any one of my neighbor's houses where they can plainly see me and I can plainly see them. And so we give each other a little knowing nod and I start to relax and settle and whisper to myself, Holy Spirit, come. No kidding. Small, but pretty big for me. Pretty cool. Another word of encouragement. My husband and I had recently separated and we were having lots of issues with our 12-year-old daughter. And I came to Open Door because I had heard that Open Door was for Christians who couldn't really get their act together. Yes! That needs to be on our website. Open Door for Christians who can't get their act together. Well, I was really struggling with my faith, my life, my purpose, etc., etc., so Open Door sounded like a good fit to me. And as I sat there in the dark, pouring out my heart to God, I not only felt God's presence, but heard God tenderly say, tenderly and lovingly, her name, you can trust me. And she writes, that was what I needed. I didn't need to hear everything was going to be fine. I didn't need to hear, but, because that would have felt false. No, you can trust me. I want to read one story of correction. I wish I had time to read all these because they were all amazing, but this one might be one of those ouch ones for you. It is for me. One of my encounters with the Holy Spirit lately was one of conviction. I was convicted of an email I sent to someone zinging them with sarcasm, reacting to their email where I felt unjustly blamed again by them. Immediately after pressing the send button, I had emailers remorse. Ever had that? No, I didn't think so. Which only got worse for the next two days. I tried to justify my retort by rereading it a few times in my sent box. I've never done that. To see if, that it really wasn't that bad, but the Holy Spirit wouldn't let up, and my spirit felt more and more agitated and heavy with what I had written, until finally I wept with the realization of the sin that was embedded deep within me. So strong was the conviction that I literally felt sick to my stomach, and so remorseful over my poor reflection of the Christ who I claimed dwelled in me. I then felt led to call this person and apologize, and only until I did, did the horrible feelings of sorrow and remorse ease. So anyone need to make a phone call this afternoon? Seriously. Anyone need to kind of scan their consciousness? Oh man. Yeah, I did that. Did that yesterday. Last one I'll read is this woman that she wrote a bunch of really amazing stories, but she goes, she ends it, Okay, I know this is really long, but something just occurred to me as I was going to sign off. One of the things that I've been hearing from God over and over again for many months now as I pray through the sanctuary, which is so sweet, she prays through the sanctuary for you. So amazing. God raised us up as a body, she prays. If we only knew the power we collectively wield. Individually, we can do your work, but collectively, we are a power that can have serious impact in your kingdom. So God, wake us up to this reality. Church of the Open Door is a mighty power for the kingdom of God. She writes, really, when I pray this, there's some serious passion around this. So, how do you hear from God? How do you raise your antenna so that when God speaks, you can hear it? I don't think there's a lot of formula for it. I think the first thing and most important thing is you've got to want it. Then you've got to be willing to do something about it. But I think this could be helpful for us to look at. How can I hear God? Well, you can whisper a prayer every morning saying, God, speak to me. I'm listening. God, speak to me. I'm listening. You can start every day before your feet hit the ground with that prayer. And then you wait and you listen. And in my experience, most of the time it's really little. It's stuff like, Steve, you fold the laundry before you leave the house. Yeah. Steve, take it easy when you're driving. Steve, go back to that person and apologize. Steve, go back to that person and ask them how they experienced you in that meeting when you got a little passionate. It's little things. And then if you're confused, ask for help. Ask someone. Say, this is what I think I'm hearing from God, but I don't know if it's from God. Ask for help. That's what the body of Christ is for. And then once you kind of feel like it might be, receive it and or do it. Make a decision that you will do it, that you will move, that you will go to the house on straight street. even though you're confused and filled with fear so many times. And it's not like this happens to me all the time. That sounded weird. But when I get these promptings, it's usually accompanied by, I can't do that. They would think I'm crazy. And then, but when you do it, you need to leave the results to God. Your responsibility is simply to respond. Leave the results to God. God is up to something that only God knows. our job is simply to be responsive to God's voice in our lives and to raise the antenna so that we can create some space to hear God's voice. If we had time to hear each of you, you would all have stories where this has happened to you. Maybe you didn't even know it was God. That was God? That's how God works? Yes. You can probably hear God a lot better than you think. The still, small voice, the whisper of God. Verses that have helped me as I've tried to cultivate and ear to hear God is this, Psalm 32a. It's just a good remembering. God does instruct me. I will instruct you and I will teach you in the way that you should go, Steve. I will counsel you with my loving eye on you. And that's just a great reminder to me. This is what God does. This is who God is. God counsels me. God teaches me. God reminds me. And the word teach is this Hebrew word called yara, Which literally means it's like rain falling. It means rain. And when rain falls and hits you right on the head, you're like, wow, that's the picture. That I will give you messages that you know it's me. And so another verse, Isaiah 30, 21. I love this one. Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you saying, this is the way, walk in it. Which means to me, when I am making mistakes, turning to the left or turning to the right, when I'm screwing up and not following in the way, God will whisper to me, hey, Steve, this way. I'm not going to leave you. When I make a mistake, my life is not over. There's a voice right behind me going, no, no, no, no, just this is the way. Isn't that comforting? As we do this experiment of trying to hear from God. Well, here's what I want to challenge you to do. Us as a church, as many of you that would say yes, Would you say yes to every day for the next 30 days praying that prayer, God speak, I'm listening? Would you say yes to that invitation? Just pray that prayer. Maybe it's once a day, maybe it's 100 times a day. God speak, I'm listening. And then you raise your antenna and wait for God to speak. And then you receive it. It might be a word of encouragement. I remember one time I was going through such a hard time, and I got this word from God. It was four statements, and it was, Steve, I am in this. I will shepherd this. I am with you. Do not fear. Didn't tell me everything was going to be fine. Didn't tell me it wasn't going to be hard. It just, it was the word of encouragement that the Lord was in. So I wrote it down. Well, so if anyone's in that, we've created a little tool that will help encourage each other. And the tool is, we're going to create a Twitter account called OD Whispers. And every day for the next 30 days, if you follow this Twitter account, OD Whispers, you're going to get just thoughts and scriptures and quotes and encouragements from other people who are also trying to hear from God. And so if you, now I know about 10% of you are on Twitter. So if you're not on Twitter, you need to ask your nine-year-old son to teach you how to get on Twitter. If you don't have a nine-year-old son, here's how you do it. You just go to twitter.com, you select a username and password, and then you follow OD Whispers. And if you're still like, I don't know if I can do it. You don't need a smartphone. You can do it right on your computer. I'm going to teach you how to do it right now in the next 30 seconds, okay? Is that cool? Okay. So here we are. We're going to go. You can see my last service is already up there. So twitter.com takes us to this screen. You're going to sign up here. Dave Johnson, because he's not on Twitter, but we're going to get him on Twitter. There's his email, so the rest of you can email him today. That's great. And then password, kind of a big deal. Sign up. okay so we got the name dave johnson the email that's cool you gotta they're gonna email you a confirmation then you have to click on it uh the password's okay i would have said it's awesome it's brilliant but then you know dave johnson 34 that's kind of weird so what about like rabbi dj is that already taken no way okay rabbi dj od oh that one's good okay so and then you would just click on create my account, and then you would follow OD Whispers. Does that make sense, gang? All right. So you don't have to do that. And please don't, like if you're having problems with Twitter, don't call me tomorrow morning and say, oh my gosh, I'm having problems with Twitter. You know, again, nine-year-old. I mean, talk to your nine-year-old son, or talk to someone else, or talk to Twitter. If you can't remember the name OD Whispers, I'd be happy to, you know, tell you that. But Okay, does that sound fun? It's going to be a fun experiment where we try to listen to God again. Yes, cool. Again. And we will find other ways to just share with the body of Christ what's happening as we listen. We'd love to hear from you. We'd love for this to be an experiment with our whole church. So as we move to the table, here's what I want to leave you with. We're going to move to the table. Some of you feeling like, oh, I really want to hear from God. And so I just, we are over time, but I need to tell you this last story because it's sick. And by sick, I mean awesome. Do you remember last year, I told you this story that I was in a communion service and there was this group of three people sitting here praying. And I got a picture of a waterfall. And then I got a word connected to it, Waterfall of Grace. Does anyone remember me telling you this story? And so I went up to this poor three people and I just said, I'm sorry for interrupting your prayer time. I feel so stupid saying this and doing this. I am an idiot. I am sorry. But I feel like maybe the Lord gave me a picture. It's a waterfall. It's a waterfall of grace for you. I just feel like that might be a word from God for you. I don't know that it is, but there you go. And I'm like backing up and feeling dumb. Well, several weeks later, I got some more information that this woman was in grave danger. Her life was in danger. She had, through a series of events, kind of taken a very bad turn. And so a bunch of us were praying for her. And some of you remember that our whole church prayed for her. I mean, during one of the services, I invited all of us to pray for her. And then I heard a few things here and there, but I hadn't heard about it for a long time until last night after me preaching this message. This woman walks up to me. She'd been down in Florida for a long time. She walks up to me and she goes, Steve. She was carrying her Bible. The word for me that God gave me through you, the waterfall of grace, saved my life. I wasn't ready to hear it then, but it came at the right time. I have it all written down. I was miraculously healed from the thing that had my life in danger. God is so amazing. I'm following God now. My husband became a Christian because of this whole crazy story. And I just wanted to tell you, Steve, the whispers of God are real. And when I heard that, I mean, you guys, I was like, I literally went like this. And then I hugged her, you know, because I was like, okay, that's awkward to just do this. But then I stepped back and I just said, I'm just kind of in shock, you know. I mean, I don't, wow. And what it made me do is, okay, Lord, here I am, you know. Lord, I don't, or whatever it is you want me to do. however silly it sounds, I will do. I will do. Thank you.
