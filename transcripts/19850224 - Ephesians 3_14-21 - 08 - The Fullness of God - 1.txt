Open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, the third chapter, in the 14th verse in our continuing study in this very important book, and in this very important text, Ephesians chapter 3, verse 14. Paul is stopping in this series of instruction, and he's praying that God would enable his people to do the things that they need to do to be obedient. And he It says in verse 14, For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, I pray, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner man, in order that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, and in order that you, being rooted and grounded in love, you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, in order that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God. Now to him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we could ask or think, according to the power that's at work within us, to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus, to all generations, forever and ever. Amen. Let's pray. Lord, I'm feeling really inadequate this morning. to deal with this text in a way that would convey the truth with all the power that is here. And Father, maybe part of the weakness I'm feeling is because I know that this needs to be applied to me. Open our hearts to your truth this morning, that we may do the things you call us to do. Amen. this is our second week in this very crucial text i told you last week and shared a little bit of my heart with you concerning the importance of this i believe that there is no point in going on to chapter four unless this is not only understood but applied chapter three verses 14 through 21 we called it the ignition of the believer this is where it all gets turned on this is where we begin to turn on the power that we've been describing in the first two three chapters we talked about the fact and in an effort to to illustrate the importance of this text and in an effort to illustrate the power that is here we kind of backed off and likened this passage to a car now i know that sounds cheap and it sounds contrived and it sounds kind of goofy but it really works fairly well you see i could know everything about a car i could know how to take it apart and put it back together i could know just exactly how the engine runs but it does me absolutely no good unless I sit down, put the key in the ignition, and turn it on. On the other hand, I could be a total ignoramus concerning cars, but if I'm doing the things that are required to turn that thing on, it's going to do the things I need it to do. It's going to take me to places I need to have it taken. And we talked about the fact that chapters one through three is as if we were talking about the power plant of this car, the power plant, the energy system, the engine. We studied in those chapters who we are in Christ, what we have in Christ, all of the riches that are ours as believers, the power that is ours as believers. And in chapters four through six, something we haven't gotten into yet, we talked about the fact that that's like a road map for the believer. Okay, you understand who you are, you understand what you have, you understand your spiritual engine. Now, here's where I want you to take that vehicle. Here's how I want you to behave. But the problem is, and we all realize that this is imminently possible and maybe this is the struggle i shared with you as i was praying for me it is imminently possible for us to be believers it is possible for me to stand before you and teach you the truth and still never never never apply it never turn on the ignition that makes these things real and we can know all about the riches of his grace and we can know all about the resources we have and we can know all about the race that's going to be run we can know the route that we have to take But if that key, by an act of my will, isn't turned on, I'm never going to experience Ephesians chapter 3, verse 20, exceeding abundantly beyond everything I could ask or think. Chapter 4, the race has begun. The race has begun. Chapters 1 through 3, we've been talking about the engine. In chapter 3, 14 through 21, it's as if we've come to the place where the man says, ladies and gentlemen, start your engines. here we go Paul says I bow my knee I bow my knee and I pray to the Father that the believer would turn the power that he has on I pray that he would begin to use the resources that he has and the resources we have are abundant we are rich as believers we know that we've studied that chapter 1 chapter 1 verse 7 talks about the riches of his grace verse 11 talks about the inheritance that are the riches of the believer chapter 2 verse 8 talks about the fact that God is rich. The believer is rich. Chapter 2, verse 7. Christ is rich. Chapter 3, verse 8. The unfathomable riches of his grace. We are rich. We know that. In fact, Paul knows that so well and realizes that this richness, this power that the believer has in his possession is so hard to understand that his ability is short. He can't convey that. And so he backs off in chapter 1, verse 18, and prays that God the Father, through the Holy Spirit, would enlighten believers as to what they have because with the mortal mind we can't understand so he backs off and prays that they would understand what they have and now in chapter three verses 14 through 21 he backs off and prays that they might use the resources that they have again so what if we know them if we're not using them they're of little value they're of no value for this reason because of the resources they have because of the richness that is theirs the richness that is ours verse 22 because we are the habitation of god because he dwells within us and all the power that is his is ours i want you and i want me to begin to turn on that power so that verse 20 exceeding abundance will be the result let's look at the text first thing we need to notice is that this is a progression that leads to chapter 20 we don't just jump into chapter 20 and expect exceeding abundance to be part of our lifestyle there is a progression here one truth is built on another truth and that's built on another truth and that is built on another truth you see something happens it starts in verse 16 and when that happens then something else happens and when that happens then something else happens and all of those things progress to verse 20 you see verse 20 is the result of these things happening, these things taking place. The sequence, the ultimate end being verse 20, has five basic steps, and I'm going to give you them very quickly. We're going to be discussing them over the next couple of weeks. I've told you a few weeks ago, and I think I'm reminding you every week, that I don't preach little triads, one, two, three, save, sanctify, and surrender to whatever. We have five-point sermons, but they last five weeks, so you've got hang in here with me the five basic steps involved in leading to verse 20 is this it starts with strengthening the inner man we're going to talk about today it leads to it leads to the indwelling of christ it that leads to incomprehensible love and that leads to infinite fullness and that is followed all of those working together is followed by internal power verse 20. but today we have to begin at the beginning you see if we're going to get turned on and if we're going to really use the the power that Christ has already given to us and lives within us, we must begin with the concept of strengthening the inner man. Verse 16, this is where we're going to focus and I'm going to read it again. His prayer was that he would grant to us, according to the riches of his grace, of his glory, that we would be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inner man. Now, the first question we have to talk about and we have to get squared away right off the bat is, what are we talking about when we talk about the inner man? Now, we don't have to get real deep about this. We don't have to get real theological about this. It's really very simple. It simply means this. The inner man is the real you. The inner man is the inside you. The inner man is the part of you that feels and thinks. It is the spirit and the soul of you. Maybe the best way to understand the inner man and how the inner man operates is by contrasting the inner man to the outer man. The inner man and the outer man. The outer man is this thing you see. the outer man you got up this morning and immediately you had to face the outer man for some of you that was quite a trauma i can just believe that as i look out here for some of you that was a real trauma you got up this morning and immediately you faced the outer man and you washed the outer man and you brushed the outer man and you cleaned the outer man's teeth and then you clothed the outer man and then you went downstairs or into the kitchen and you began to feed the inner man and that's all wonderful if you don't eat you're not going to be strong I encourage you to feed the outer man. It's important. Some of you this morning, we have some real lunatics in our church. Some of you this morning, before you came to church, you exercised the outer man. Some of you were running miles this morning. Crazy people. But, and all that's good. You have to do that. You want to do that. You prepared the outer man. You groom it. You wash it. You clean it. You exercise it. You feed it. And having done all those things, having prepared the outer man, you come here. And one of the things we attempt to do here is we attempt to minister to the inner man, the real you, the spirit and soul of you. And Paul says if you want to have a full life, if you want to have an abundant life, if you want to bring glory to God in your life, that's where you need to be focusing. The inner man, you see, is the real you. We have in our country an obsession with the outer man. I don't know, big revelation from Pastor Dave this morning. We have an obsession with the outer man. We look to Madison Avenue, we look to television and everyone else to tell us what the outer man is supposed to look like, how the outer man is supposed to dress, the right kind of makeup, the right kind of toothpaste is absolutely essential. I'll never have any success with interpersonal relationships unless I have the right toothpaste. You know that. Everybody knows that. The right jeans, designer jeans. You know, nothing is going to come between me and them. The right haircut. We're really into body beautiful. We lift weights and so we jog and we lift the weights and we join the health club and all these wonderful things and they're good. I'm not putting any of that down. Exercise, it's important. I do it. But I think this obsession with the outer man needs to be balanced with the facts. Please, I want you to know just exactly the way I said that. I think this obsession with the outer man needs to be balanced with the facts, underlying facts. You see, the facts are these. The outer man is dying day by day. The outer man is decaying day by day. Now, I can prolong it, and I'm going to try. I'm going to do everything I can to keep this outer man in pretty decent shape so it can go a long way. I don't want to go anywhere. I don't want to be sick or anything like that. I can try to prolong it. I can work on it to make it look better and all those things, but the facts are these. The outer man is dying day by day. There isn't anything I can do about it. No matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, You can go to Sweden and have these little facelifts and have these little things that, you know, I saw something on TV not long ago where they were having the fountain of youth. They discovered it or something. Wonderful. Eventually you're fighting a losing battle. There we go. The outer man is dying. Paul says bodily exercise profiteth little. He doesn't say bodily exercise doesn't profit at all. He says bodily exercise profiteth little. Why? Because the outer man is dying day by day. And there's nothing you can do about it. And that is why the Apostle Paul says, where I want to focus my attention and where I want to focus my discipline in terms of building something up that's going to last is on the inner man. The inner man is the real you. And that's where the believer focuses the priority of his life, developing a strong inner man. I can continue this contrast between the outer man and the inner man by looking at 2 Corinthians 4, verse 16. Again, we see the contrast. Paul is in a situation in this chapter where the circumstances in his life are lousy. In fact, that's the first thing he says in this text. He says, I feel lousy. I feel depressed. I feel crushed. I feel perplexed. I'm confused. I don't know which direction to go. I feel forsaken. I don't have any friends. I'm preaching the truth, and people are leaving me. But, verse 16, we faint not. How in the world could he do that? The outer man was being attacked. The outer man was being forsaken. There were no friends. There was no support. But we faint not. Why? Because, verse 16, though the outer man is decaying day by day, the inner man is being, continually being, renewed day by day. What a picture that is. You see, I may be getting it on the outside, but Jesus is giving it on the inside, and that's what it means to be strengthened with power by his spirit in the inner man. Again, the picture we get, it's incredible. It's one we don't connect with, but when we hear it, we know it's true. The picture is this. The outer man, this flesh you see, is descending and there's nothing I can do about it. But the joy of being a believer is that at the same time this fleshly body is decaying day by day, I have, because of the resources within me, the potential to be increasing every day. The outer man descends, the inner man ascends. The inner man accelerates. The older the body gets, the more the body declines. I can verify that. All you've got to do is come and watch us play softball. You see some of these older guys out there, the punches are hanging a little bit more, and they're going a little bit slower, and they used to be fast, but they're not anymore. The outer man is decaying. But the beauty of this is that the believer, the older he gets, because of the life of Christ living within him, he has the potential to get stronger every day, to grow every day. What a strange paradox. Spoke to you last week about Lillian Daniels, that dear saint. We're still praying for her. But there is a beautiful example of one whose body is decaying. It's just, it's terrible. It's pain. It looks like death. But her inner man every day is being renewed. And I guarantee that the deepest desire of her inner man right now is to leave that decaying body and take one more step and be with the Father and fulfill all of the dreams of that inner man. The outer man is decaying. The inner man is growing stronger every day. But the problem is this. If, as believers, we have all the resources within us and the power of God and the power of the Spirit and the power of Christ living within us, but we are not focusing on strengthening the inner man, if that is not one of our priorities, the resource is not going to be there when the going gets tough. You're going to find out when the going gets tough that you've got a weak inner man and you've been spending all your time strengthening the outer man. But we've got a weak inner man. I find it a real heartache as a pastor. And it's a real frustration as a pastor. And it's something that I have to face in my own life. But it's something that you do too. This, by the way, is all about me and him and you and the Lord and not anything else. The real heartache is this, is dealing with believers who are in distress. who even though they have the life of Christ within them have not been focusing at all on walking with the Spirit and strengthening the inner man and when the trouble comes the resource isn't there because their inner man is strong is weak he is talking to believers here folks he's not talking to people who don't know Christ he's talking to people who have the resource but their inner man is weak and we maybe have gone to church all our lives but the inner man has never been focused on the fact is this that there are things that come into our lives that are not always rosy we already know the fact that because you come a believe become a believer doesn't mean that everything just becomes rosy and wonderful we know that from second corinthians 14 or second corinthians 4 where paul talks about his distress and his persecution and his being forsaken and god's solution to the distress and persecution and frustration that i go through is not a magic wand that goes over my life and says, poof, it's all gone. That is not his solution. His solution for me to handle my distress and persecution and frustration is this, that you would be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inner man so that when distress comes and when frustration comes and when all those wonderful things that are about life come into my life, I will not despair. But I can say with the Apostle Paul, we are afflicted, but we are not crushed. Why? Because while I'm getting it on the outside, Jesus has given it on the inside, and I've got a strong inner man. That's the focus for the believer. That's the priority for the believer. Okay. Let's say we all agree. I assume we do. Everybody's going, yeah, we need a strong inner man. That's what we need. That's not the problem, you see. Every one of us heartily agree with the fact that if we're going to make it as believers, if we're going to move to that abundant life, we've got to have a strong inner man. The problem is that while we hardly agree with that in our minds, so often what I see in my life is a different truth. I don't see that strong inner man. I don't see that thing happening in my life on a practical level. Paul had that exact same problem in Romans 7. We know all about it. Verse 22, he says this, Hey, I joyfully concur with the law of God in my inner man. You know, in my heart, I look at the law of God, and I see the things he wants me to do and the way he wants me to be, and I go, Yeah, that's what I want. Those are the things I want in my life. The problem for me, he says in verse 23, is the problem is I see a different law at work in my outer man. And the war between my inner man and my outer man is just being waged all the time. And it looks like I'm losing. The things that I want to do, I don't do. And the things that I don't want to do, I end up doing. And I've got a weak inner man. That was his problem. And in chapter 8, he discovered the secret to developing a strong inner man. and that was when he discovered the Holy Spirit, and the fact that the Holy Spirit is the one who strengthens the inner man, and he plugged into that, and he got strong. But see, I'm still jumping ahead of the gun. We've got to go slower. I don't want to just give you some little pat answer. The thing we need to deal with is not, this morning, is not, do we need a strong inner man? Everybody joyfully concurs with that. Yes, we need a strong inner man. The thing we need to deal with this morning, and the question we need to answer is this. How do I become strengthened in the inner man? How do I do it? You know, we're all going, yeah, yeah, we need a strong inner man. Well, how do I do it? Let's look at the text. Verse 16, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his spirit. The way we develop a strong inner man is what? Through his spirit. By the spirit. The Holy Spirit is the one who strengthens the inner man. So the key to this is allowing the spirit in us to control us so he can work in us. Nice. Isn't that cute? Okay, got that. Allowing the Holy Spirit in us to control us so He can work in us. You got that? That's wonderful. We call it yielding to the Spirit, right? We call it allowing the Spirit to work in my life. We call it letting go and letting God. Okay, that's my sermon. Let go and let God. Allow the Spirit to work in your life. Yield to the Spirit, okay? You know, I've heard those little ditties all my life. I grew up on yielding to the Spirit. Yield to the Spirit. I said, in all my life, this is what I said. Okay. Okay, I will. In all my life, the little conversation went like this. You preachers say, be strengthened with power in the inner man. I say, how? You say, yield to the Holy Spirit. And I'd say, okay. It wasn't until somewhere in college, somewhere late in the years, that I had the guts to finally say, what do you mean? What does it mean to yield to the Spirit? how do I yield to the spirit you tell me to do it I go okay I'll try and I have no idea what that means clear it all up today please hang with me you see I don't think this is weird I don't think this is mystical I don't think this is strange and magical and somehow just some spirit comes over us and all of a sudden I'm doing all the wonderful things I'm supposed to do and it's just some sort of we get that idea I think Have you ever prayed for something in your life to be developed like discipline or some sort of stop having lust or something like that? And you hear this yield to the Spirit. So what I really believe is that yielding to the Spirit is that I'm just going to quit trying to do it. So I'll quit trying to have discipline. So I'll just go to bed and I'll wake up in the morning and the Spirit will give me discipline. Oh, no. Something didn't work. Discipline never came. You know. The key to unlocking these things, I think, are very simple and very clear. We've heard them, but we need to apply them. I think the first key to grasping this can be found in Galatians 5.16, something very simple. But I want to explain it so we understand it. Again, it's something we've heard over and over again. It says simply this, walk in the Spirit and you won't fulfill the desires of the flesh. Walk in the Spirit. There you go, another little cliche. Walk in the Spirit. But my question again is, what does that mean? How do I do that? the thing I want you to catch here is that walking in the spirit is the key word a walk it's a walk what that means is walking in the spirit is something to do with my daily conduct walking in the spirit is something that happens moment by moment by moment that's why they call it a walk you see when I walk what I do I don't know what you do but what I do is I put my left foot forward then I put my way down then I put my right foot and I go like this it's really wonderful how that works I walk it's one step at a time we have the idea that spirit control is something I do maybe in the morning. Bam. Lord, control my life. And I go. See? Right? That's what we do. Or else we think spirit control is something I do in a meeting like this. I'll give an invitation. You go, oh, that's what I need. Come forward. We pray. Bam. It happened. Listen. Spirit control has nothing to do. It's like we think it's like right guard deodorant. One shot and you're good for the whole day. It doesn't work that way. It's walking in the spirit. Step by step. Moment by moment. Consciously being aware that someone is indwelling me. I am the habitation of God. He is living in me. He is working in me. And step by step, moment by moment, it's being conscious of the Holy Spirit. But more than that, it's being obedient to the Holy Spirit within me. That's the first thing. I want you to grasp that. I want you to play with that. I want you to work with it. Walking in the Spirit, step by step, moment by moment. It's not one shot and you're good for the whole day. maybe I need to make a distinction here in case this isn't here but it just occurred to me that some of us might be confused between the difference between being filled with the spirit and the indwelling of the spirit we talked in Ephesians 1 that all of us when we become believers are sealed in the spirit the Holy Spirit comes and takes his residence in my life and now you're talking about that happening all the time there's a difference between being filled in the spirit Ephesians 5 where it says be filled with the spirit and there's a difference between that and being indwelt. There is not a believer who doesn't have the Holy Spirit inhabiting their life. This even fits in very tightly with the text we're in. You are the habitation of God. He lives within you. Now be strengthened in the inner man. Be controlled by the Spirit. Be filled with the Spirit. Be continually filled with the Spirit. Okay, that's the first thing you need to get. It's a moment-by-moment thing. It's being conscious of and obedient to the Spirit of God within you, but there's a second thing we need to grasp when these things tie together. I can't just give you that. The second thing you need to grasp is that, is this, that that walking in the spirit, that control of the spirit of my life, in my life, that control is engaged or turned on by an act of my will. Please get that. That control is engaged or turned on. Now we're talking about the ignition. This thing is engaged or turned on by an act of my will. I decide. You see, somewhere along the line, I can say yes to the Spirit's direction. I can take a step and I can see the Spirit leading me in a direction to give or not to give or to get involved or not to get involved. And I can say yes to the Spirit. I can follow Him or I can say no. And that's called quenching the Spirit. Very good term. You see, the Spirit is moving me in a direction and I push it down. I say no. I decide. And I believe. I believe because I've seen the potential in me that believers can get into a position where they have quenched the spirit so many times and so often that if the spirit began to direct in their lives they wouldn't even recognize it because they're numb to the movement and the direction that the spirit can give in the believer's life life is full of decisions the alarm goes off in the morning and i'm faced with decisions i can i can call in sick or i can tell the truth i can i go downstairs and i got a decision i was a post toasties or captain crunch which do I eat? Do I wear a blue shirt or the green shirt? Do I yield to the Spirit's control step by step or don't I? Do I lie or do I yield? Do I act petty and childish in my relationships with believers and non-believers or do I yield to the Spirit and let Him control? Do I play games or do I let the Spirit control my life? Walking in the Spirit, God's promise is you walk in the spirit day by day, moment by moment, and you will not fulfill the desires of the flesh. Galatians 5 again. Walk in the spirit and you won't fulfill the desires of the flesh. It does not say, folks, that you walk in the spirit and the desires won't be there anymore. They'll all go away. Poof! That's what we're looking for in magic formula. Poof! They're all gone. I don't have them anymore. At first those desires are going to pull very hard, but you know what? The strengthening of the inner man, what this whole thing means is this. As I walk in the spirit step by step, moment by moment and take every step one at a time every time i make a decision and engage this thing with my mind and with my heart to obey what i've done when i engage this thing to and obey the spirit to his direction what i've done is i've exercised the spiritual muscle and every time i exercise a spiritual muscle what happens when you exercise a physical muscle what it builds when you leave it alone what happens they atrophy they just die and i exercise my spiritual muscles and what happens after a while that inner man gained strength as the spirit of god is allowed in my life to do the things he wants to do but it's all engaged by an act of my will i decide which way am i going to obey or am i not so far the things i've talked about and i don't even know if i want to get into this because we're going to talk about it when we get to ephesians 5 but so far i've talked about in this governing of the spirit of god in my life things that being having the inner strength being strong enough in the inner man to be able to distinguish between right and wrong and choosing what is right, okay? When the inner man is strong, I choose what is right, okay? The problem is that the Spirit of God and walking in the Spirit is a bigger concept than that. There are times as a believer and as a mature Christian, my decisions are not just between black and white. They are between good and what's best. They are what is the Spirit of God leading me into that is good. What kinds of ministries does he want to lead me into? I had a friend, and I've got a shirt who who shared with me this morning, he's in the ministry. He's in the ministry, and he doesn't have a lot of money at all. And he was confronted with the problem of another person who was also in a ministry, and it was a camping type of ministry. And I don't understand the whole story, but you'll get the point. He needed some money to continue his ministry. And this minister who was talking to this other minister was sharing the need. And this guy doesn't have a lot of money, and all of a sudden the Spirit of God, because of a walk of the Spirit moment by moment, began to prompt him to do something. You know, what we do is when we're exposed to a need, we see people who are poor, we see people who are hurt, we see people who are sick, and what we do, the Spirit prompts us to pray, right? I think somewhere along the line, the Spirit is prompting us to do something. And I think those with a strong inner man, that one who is really sensitive to the Spirit, begin to do things. And so this person who had very little money looked at the other person in need and says, I am going to provide for that need. The Spirit of God, and it isn't even that, it's not him providing for the need, The Spirit of God prompted him to get involved in that need. He gave the money. He had no money. What in the world is going to supply his need? I think the beauty of the body of Christ is that as we are perceptive and as we are receptive to the Spirit of God working and moving us as we're walking in the Spirit, I respond to the Spirit's moving in me to give that money. And somewhere along the line, the Spirit of God is going to move someone else to meet my need. And the body grows and the body functions. and all of a sudden it's real supernatural. You know, this is one of the reasons, by the way, that the Word of God is so firm on leadership in the church being spirit-filled. This is absolutely why it is essential for the people on our boards who are our elders and our executive board to be people who are what? Walking in the Spirit. You know why? Because if we're not walking in the Spirit's leadership, we are never going to perceive the needs of our church. it's always going to be physical temporal things we talk about when we come up to his decision you know what the question we're going to ask how much does it cost that is an indicator of one who's walking in the spirit one who's walking in the spirit says what does the spirit want us to do what does the spirit want us to do when we're walking in the spirit we're receptive to that as he directs i say yes to the spirit i say yes we're going to go that way Why? Because that's what he wants us to do. What about money? He'll provide. That builds a strong church. Okay, we need to realize that strengthening the inner man involves walking in the spirit. Day by day, moment by moment, that work of the spirit in my life is engaged by my will. It's turned on by my will. I decide to say yes, or I decide to quench the spirit. It's engaged by an act of my will, and spiritual muscles are developed as I simply yield to and obey the promptings of his life within me. And the beautiful thing is as I obey and as I obey pretty soon, it's no big hairy thing. It's not trying at all. It really isn't some big thing like that. It's just yielding. It's giving the control to him. And after a while, it just becomes a part of my lifestyle. And the easiest thing in the world for me to do is respond to the spirit who's moving me this way and moving me that way. And what a thrill it is when a church functions like that. Oh, my goodness. It looks a lot like the church. The muscles are built and the inner man is strong. But there's one more crucial dimension to strengthening the inner man. Extremely important that we get this. We have been talking about a dimension of the inner man that we could call exercising the inner man. Okay, it has to do with the spirit's direction. It has to do with walking in the spirit. It has to do with building spiritual muscles by obedience. But there's something else that that inner man needs, just like the outer man does. He needs to be fed. That inner man needs to be fed. How do we do that? Ephesians 5.18 says, be filled with the Spirit. A parallel passage to that is found in Colossians 3.16. It says this, let the word of Christ dwell in you richly. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly. David said, thy words have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee. By feeding the inner man what i'm simply meaning is filling our minds with the word of god very simple filling our minds with the word of god and this is another area that you've heard a million times now he's going to yell at us because we're not supposed to get in the bible we need to feed the inner man i want you to note something very important before i even go on and elaborate on this anymore it's extremely important that both of these things the exercise of the inner man which builds spiritual muscles and the feeding of the inner man are intertwined they can never be separated, ever. Let me explain. If someone is just reading the Word and doesn't exercise his will to apply what he's reading, it's absolutely useless. What you're going to have is a fat Christian, okay? Quite frankly, he takes it in, he takes it in, he takes it in, he takes it in, he understands, he knows, he could stand, I could, you know, the pastor could be just that way. I understand, I know better than you, I know because I'm in it all the time, so I'll just tell you the truth. Problem is, James 1.25 says, you are not blessed. There is no blessing in reading the word. The blessing comes when we, what? Do the word. When it's applied by an act of my will, the food becomes effective. Try the other thing by itself, so they're both together, but try the other thing by itself. Try to live the life. Try to be strong in the man and exercise the will without drinking in the word i guarantee you try to live the life without drinking in the word you're going to run out of gas that's what's going to happen because for one thing if you don't know what the word is telling us to do that's how the spirit talks to us this is how the spirit instructs us tells us which direction to go i know very clearly which direction to go because the spirit of god is telling me through his word and if we're not drinking that in all the time, then I'm going to run out of gas and I'm going to burn out. The question is this, how often do we feed the inner man? When's the last time, how often do we take a drink of the Spirit through His Word? See, the problem for a lot of us is that the only time we drink in the Word is on Sunday. Think about that, you know. That's a hard one to say because I remember times in my life when that was exactly the case and so I know that that's the case for some of you. The only time we're drinking in the Word is on Sunday. Imagine just for a moment treating the outer man that way, okay? And let's make it the best possible circumstances we can think of. The outer man gets one meal a day. It's a doozy. It's great. Mashed potatoes, gravy, lots of gravy, roast beef. It's tender. All you can eat. All the salad you want. Salad bar is open. You can go there. All you want. Dessert, all the appetizers. Everything is there. Gorge yourself. You'll be filled to overflowing. In fact, you'll be so full and it'll be so good that maybe Monday morning you won't want to eat because you're just so moved still. But I guarantee if you're anything like me, Sunday afternoon I'm still going to be hungry. I'm going to want to go and have some more. And if we're only getting one meal a day for the outer man, I guarantee somewhere along the line that outer man is going to get weak. That's not real healthy to do that, especially if you're living that way. But that's just exactly how so many of us treat the inner man. We go to church and what we're going to church for basically is to get our weekly fix and we hope the music is great and we hope the pastor's cooking because boy I'll tell you I'm all dried out and if I don't get something Sunday I'm just gonna die and you know what happens this is what happens too you know where I get all these examples it's like no nobody's coming to me and telling me this is how it is this is what I do so often I'll go to church and it's not great it's not powerful it doesn't move me and I leave picked off I go this music stunk Let's not be naive. Let's not think that we can live like that, give it one meal a week, and have a strong inner man. There's no way. There's no way. Our church, you come to our church, I love it. But you know what? It doesn't matter how great our church is. It doesn't matter how sensitive we are, how successful the ministry is. We cannot strengthen anyone's inner man. There's no way. We cannot give an abundant life to anybody. The reason we call this whole thing a personal relationship with Christ is because it's a personal relationship with Christ. Because it's between me and him somewhere. It's not between me and you. I can't look to you to strengthen me. We have fellowship and there is building in all those things. I think you know I'm talking about something else. That personal relationship with Christ. Somewhere along the line, I decide to walk in the Spirit, to feed that inner man or not. The problem with us, a lot of us, is that some of us, we can't deal with that. You see, if I'm sputtering as a Christian, and if I'm an eight-cylinder Christian and it's all there and I'm only running on six cylinders and the only one that's keeping me going is that one and I'm kind of going like that, the easiest thing in the world for me to do is not look at myself and say, what's gone wrong here? The easiest thing in the world for me to do is look out here and say, gee, it's you. It's your fault. You know, well, my line is this, okay? I'll just give you my line. My line is this. If I, as the pastor, am sputtering and falling apart and my spiritual life is really weak, what I'll do is I'll go, it's the congregation's fault. They don't respond to me. They're not getting in there. Nothing's happening. It's all your fault. It has nothing to do with me and him. That's my line. You know what your line is? Because I've used this line so I can see it. Your line is, it's the pastor's fault. He isn't feeding us. He just says, so how in the world can you expect me to have a strong inner man? How do you expect me to grow as a Christian if I'm not getting fed, you know? And somewhere along the line, I decide, don't I? I decide how much that inner man is going to drink in. And if it's only Sunday morning, I guarantee you're not getting enough. And you're going to be frustrated, and you're going to be angry at our church, and you're going to be angry with our music, and you're going to be angry with our pastor because you're not going to get enough. I'm not growing as a Christian it's the church's fault they're not meeting my needs there's nothing going on for my group my age group has nothing how do you expect me to be spiritual if nothing's going on for my group I can spend my whole life blaming my circumstances blaming my congregation blaming my pastor blaming my mom and dad my mom and dad are hypocrites how would you expect me to have a relationship with christ on and on and on playing my church bringing my mother blaming my father for my spiritual stutters but somewhere along the line i decide who's going to control my life somewhere we have to see that it's a relationship between him and me and if my life is falling apart if i am perplexed and if i am destroyed and if i am beaten down and if things are not going at all my way while the outer man can be decaying, something about this can strengthen the inner man. And I can be getting it on the outside, but I can be growing on the inside and it has nothing to do with you. It has nothing to do with me. For me, I'm responsible between him and me to strengthen that inner man, to be making sure it's drinking in the Word, to be obedient. And I can't blame you. And you can't blame me. And we can't blame each other. It's between me and him. And then, with that kind of strength, we come together as a body and we function. That's the church. Paul saw that and that's why he could say my circumstances are lousy I'm afflicted I'm persecuted I'm forsaken but I'm not losing heart why? because I focus all my attention on the inner man and all those things can be falling apart but I'm growing day by day I'm getting it on the outside but Christ is giving it on the inside and that's why Paul prayed for other believers his deepest desire for them was that what? they would be strengthened with power by his spirit where? in the inner man let me just finish this by getting right to the point the fact is this we're not going to get to ephesians chapter 3 verse 20 exceeding abundantly beyond all that we could ask or think until we're living in verse 16 until we are focusing on strengthening with power through his spirit being strengthened with power through his spirit in the inner man to drink in the word to be conscious of his presence in my life to be aware of the directions that he's giving and then by an act of my will engaging my will to yield to that spirit to obey that spirit exercises our spiritual muscles and we grow and although the outer man grew one day older that inner man grew one day stronger and so as we are strengthened by his might in the inner man we're ready to take the next step and that's next week let's pray you know something just as your heads are bowed and eyes are closed some of us need to deal with this right now we can know all the truth we can know the race we can know all the things but somewhere along the line the will has to be engaged to begin to move in the direction and do the things God's called us to do. To say yes to the directions the Spirit of God is leading us. And I'm going to ask you to do two things. If you're not ready, don't do it. But again, with everybody's eyes closed, I'm going to ask you to do two things. If you're ready to do it, then do it with me, and it's in the form of a covenant, a promise. It's not one to me, it's one to the Lord. The first one is this, that you would, with the Apostle Paul, echo to the Lord. Lord Jesus, my deepest prayer for me is that I would be strengthened with power in the inner man. And Spirit of God, would you begin to direct me and control me toward the point where that inner man is being built up and strengthened. If you're ready to do that, I want you to covenant with God to do that and with me because I'm going to do that. And the second thing I want you to do is this. I want you to think of somebody you love. I want you to think about somebody you really care about. Maybe it's your husband. Maybe it's your wife. Kids, you may not register with this, but some of you may have a mom or a dad who are believers and they've known the Lord for years and they've never seen this. Maybe it'll be them. I want you to covenant that you'll pray for somebody else. Like Paul prayed for believers that he loved, that they would be strengthened with power by his spirit in the inner man. If you're ready to do that, I want you to do it. And you know, I have this tremendous urge to give an invitation to ask you to come. So I'm going to do it. If you're ready to make that kind of decision, you know something? We're a family, aren't we? We talked about that. We're a team, and I want us to all feel like we're a team. But more than that, we're a body. And I'll tell you something. if this body is going to function, we've got to all be pulling in the same direction. And we've all got to be emphasizing the same things, and this church is going nowhere unless the inner man is strengthened. And I don't think there is any need to come forward with this kind of commitment, but I'm going to extend an invitation for those of you who feel a need to be with me or to be with some other believers and seal this thing so that you can begin to make a whole new change in your life. you
