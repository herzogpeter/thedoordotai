Open your Bibles with me to the book of Matthew, chapter 18, and we're picking up our continuing study in Matthew in verse 15 today. I think in your bulletin, if you don't have a Bible, by the way, you can follow on the front of your bulletin is the text we're dealing with. It goes through verse 21 in the bulletin. We're not going to get any further today than verse 17. I think most of you who've been with us for any period of time are aware of the fact that we find ourselves in the middle of a relatively large section of Scripture as we come to this passage. The section goes all the way back to 16, chapter 16, and going through chapter 20. It is a section where Jesus has withdrawn, to some extent, from his ministry to the multitude. And he is focusing his entire ministry and discipleship on the disciples. His death is imminent, and he wants to be doing things and giving information and teaching kingdom truths to prepare his disciples for their ministry that is going to take place when he leaves. In chapter 18, this preparation has taken the form of a confrontation. The confrontation, as you know, was precipitated by a question in verse 1 when the disciples came wondering who was the greatest in the kingdom. How are we doing at our performance as it relates to all of these religious kingdom things. And thus far, in these last few weeks, as we've spent in chapter 18, we've heard Jesus confront them basically with this. Disciples, if you really want to enter into the kingdom, and if you want to enter into, not only just get into the kingdom, but if you want to move in the realities of the kingdom and have an effective ministry in the kingdom, you're going to have to change your perspective of who you are. You're going to have to change this attitude that you are super-duper performers looking for your rank, wondering who's doing the best and carrying all this stuff out in the power of your strong personality and physical capacity. You're going to have to start seeing yourselves as little children. You entered the kingdom that way saying this, my only hope for salvation is you. Dependent, helpless children for salvation. You need to know that if you're going to function in the kingdom with ministry, you're going to have to function with that same perspective. Not how am I doing, how's my performance, but absolute dependence on the Spirit of God for anything of value that's going to happen. Disciples, the confrontation was you need to see yourselves as children who are dependent. A couple of weeks ago, we got introduced to another concept where Jesus said you not only need to see yourselves as children who are dependent, but you also need to begin to see yourselves as sheep who are prone to wander. And if you aren't aware of the fact that you have this propensity in you to look away from your source and get distracted and wander away, you're going to be a very dangerous person because you're going to get lost and not even know it. You need to know that you're a child who is dependent. You need to know that you're like a sheep who wanders. And the promise from the Spirit in that text we dealt with from verse 11 to 14 was that even when you wander, you need to know that my priority is to find my lost little ones. I came to save those who are lost. And in this context, remember, that is not speaking of the unredeemed lost. That is what he's speaking of when he uses this same parable in Luke. But here it is the redeemed who've wandered away. And they are like the one sheep who of the 99 has gone astray, and I'm going to get them. I promise you that. But today, as we come to verse 15, the metaphor of a child and of sheep continues. But the application is going to shift. and the shifting of it is going to sound a little odd at first, kind of like a paradox, almost a contradiction. Because as we come to this passage, what Jesus is saying is this. Not only are you sheep, not only are you children who are dependent, and not only are you sheep who have a tendency to wander, but at the same time you are also shepherds who need to be seeking. Now the contradiction is kind of obvious when I say it that way. How can you be a wandering sheep and a seeking shepherd at the same time? I don't know. The fact is, think about your life. The fact is, every one of you from time to time get your eyes off and start getting your life from something else and you begin to wander. The fact is that you same people who wander are also in positions, sometimes on the very same day, from minute to minute, being brought back into line and getting your focus back on God, and at the same time in relationship with other people, bringing other people back. Whether it sounds like a contradiction or not, or whether the metaphors always connect, the fact is, you're children and you're dependent. You're sheep and you wander, but you also need to know that you are shepherds, every one of you who need to be about the business of bringing back the wandering. With that in view, let's look at the text. If your brother sins, go and reprove him in private. Meaning, here, I want you to be the shepherd. In verses 11 to 12, they were the lost sheep. Remember that? Now in verse 15, these guys he's speaking to are the shepherds. Go and get this one who's wandered off, and if he listens to you, you've won your brother. If he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every fact may be confirmed. And if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church, or get the whole body of believers to go after this lost little one and bring them back. And if he still refuses to listen even to the church to come back, Let them be to you as a Gentile and a tax gatherer. I want to say right now that it is very important that the full thought of our study is going to go through verse 20. And we're going to just explore that next week, but I'm going to stop here for today as we dig here tonight. Today. Let's pray as we begin. I thank you, God, for the time of worship we've had, the sense of your spirit moving among us and your people here whose hearts raised to you and adoring you and reflecting on the fact that you are powerful and glorious. Right now, as we open your precious word, we ask that the power of your spirit be released among us, not only for understanding, but God, that you would supernaturally create the kind of balance of discipline that this text is revealing, that we would be about the business of going after each other and bringing each other back into relationship and into healthy perspectives. Pray your spirit to be at work in this time. In Jesus' name, amen. This text, Matthew 18, verse 15 through 20, is a text that is commonly known as the church discipline passage. It is a text that while many of us have heard it, and many of us have tried to apply it, if you've been around a church at all, you've heard it and tried to apply it. The problem is that for many of us, it still remains misunderstood. And it still remains, in many instances, misapplied. It is a text that not only is misapplied and misunderstood very often, but it is one that generates a real degree of anxiety and fear. There are reasons for that. One of the reasons that a text on discipline is going to generate some anxiety is because all discipline, even discipline that is handled appropriately and gently and lovingly, is not a fun thing. I'm not even talking necessarily about discipline here that would mean corporal punishment. Discipline in general, by itself, is not fun. Hebrews chapter 12, verse 11 says, All discipline for the moment does not seem joyful but sorrowful, but afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness. It yields something. Again, we have this perspective of discipline being a punishment. Think of it even in a broader context. It still isn't very much fun if you're an athlete and you want to play a sport and you want to get ready for the sport. What are you going to do? You're going to discipline your body and you're going to work out. I don't know many athletes who thoroughly, and some do, but they don't, I mean, I don't like throwing up. It's not that much fun. You work and you work and you get sick and you beat your body. That part is not fun, but you do it. It's necessary. It's important because there is a payoff. One of the reasons there's some level of anxiety when you talk about discipline is it's never fun. There's another reason why discipline, and speaking of it, stirs up anxiety and fear, and that is that sometimes discipline has been administered to you or to me in a way that wasn't healthy, it wasn't nurturing, it didn't yield a righteous result because it was abusive discipline. It was a destructive thing. In a healthy context, in the context of family and friends and in the context of the church, where discipline is being administered in a healthy, balanced way, what it does is it creates a sense of safety, not fear. It creates a sense of security, not anxiety. It creates an atmosphere in a family where discipline is being administered in a healthy, loving, gentle, consistent way. It creates an atmosphere where little children can grow and flourish and move to maturity. And there is joy in that, and that is exactly how it is in a church when discipline is being administered appropriately. But when it is being used to abuse, to control, it destroys safety in a family and in a church, it destroys a sense of security, and it promotes fear and hostility. I don't think you probably have to think real long of some sort of example, possibly in your own life, where Matthew 18 was used on you not to pull you back from a straying that you were involved in and a gentle pulling back, but rather used as a club to manipulate your life because somebody else had a different agenda for you. And the issue in your life was not sin. It was their agenda, and they were imposing it on you using Matthew 18. Real big stuff. Real scary, very manipulative. It's abusive sometimes. So we come to this, and some of you have a lot of baggage relative to negative experiences attending this. On the other hand, discipline can be costly, and that's another reason why we kind of back away from this. When I speak of discipline's costliness, I'm not speaking so much of being in the position of receiving the discipline and being abused by it. Now I'm considering the position I'm in when I need to bring a discipline. I see something that needs to be confronted. I know that I've got something going on with a friend that I need to say out loud, and I've been hiding it, and I've been avoiding it and ignoring it. You see, if I were to confront him or her, they might not like me, they might abandon me, they might attack me, and instead of then being a peacemaker, bringing the truth to the issue, I become a peacekeeper and appeaser and not giving the truth, and I avoid the issues, do it in the name. a lot of churches, a lot of pastors that I have spoken with have shared with me in certain moments where they've said, you know, Dave, if I really did apply the principles of Matthew 18, of going to a brother and bringing him back and just saying out loud the thing that we see, I'd have to confront George over here. I hope there's no Georges here. That's just kind of a pretend name there. George over there, I'd have to confront him and see the real problem is he's a big giver. He gives a lot of money, and so we're going to just back off that. Sometimes discipline is costly, and so these kinds of texts are things we want to avoid. The fact is this, that healthy, balanced, ongoing discipline in the ecclesia, in the community of the redeemed, is among the most vital aspects for effective, substantial, long-term ministry. and I chose those words very carefully, effective, substantial, long-term ministry. If what God is doing here, even among us right now, is going to be effective, if it is going to have substance, if it is going to go the long haul, I guarantee you this, it is going to necessitate balanced discipline in the body. Question is this, what is balanced discipline? What is balanced, ongoing, healthy discipline? What does it look like? Where does it get applied? How do we do it? Who does it? Who gets it? Who gets the discipline applied to them? What do you do if a discipline or someone has brought a correction to you and you feel like the correction isn't appropriate, like they're bringing a false accusation? What do you do then? All of these questions and more are going to be dealt with here over the next two weeks. right here on this stage. We're not going to get through all of them today. In fact, we're not going to get much further than verse 15 today. But we are going to handle three questions, three issues relative to Matthew 18 discipline, and then do some clarification. The three questions we're going to get to are the issues are, first of all, the when of discipline. When do you bring a discipline? When is it appropriate? The second thing is the who of discipline. Who is it that's supposed to do the disciplining and the bringing back? And then the why of discipline, or what's the purpose of bringing people back? All of those things in verse 15. Let's do the why first, or the when. When do you do a discipline? Verse 15, just at the beginning. And if your brother sins. Stop right there. What sets it in motion? What sets it in motion is if your brother sins. Now, a lot of you have got impressions about what that means. I need to be very careful and do some very specific teaching on this word sin. There is a kind of sin that would be treated differently than Matthew 18 is going to treat it. The Greek word for sin here is hamartia. What that literally means is simply this, to miss something, to miss the mark. It means to be in error. It means to go astray. It means to make a departure. Now, if you were here last week, some bells are going off because you know what it sounds like? It sounds like exactly the kind of person we were talking about last week when or two weeks ago, when we spoke of the sheep that leaves the flock. He does not leave the flock going, I hate this flock. I don't like God anymore. I don't like my mom and dad. I'm leaving. It is not a picture of a child who is in angry rebellion and saying, I want to leave home and find my life somewhere else. It is not the prodigal son motif to sin when you have a brother sinning. It is the picture of the sheep or the little child who looks at the floating butterfly and really loves the father and really loves the flock, but they got distracted and they looked away and they started going over here. And it's the picture of Galatians 6 when they were running well, but they looked away and now they've fallen. And they could have fallen very possibly into some very serious things. This sheep might have wandered off and gotten on a cliff and he's really about to die. I'm not saying that the wandering away means and the fact that it isn't rebellion doesn't mean the sin is serious. The sin could be very serious, but the intention was not rebellion. They weren't trying to get away from God. They wandered. And the picture is very much that of the lost child we spoke of last week. And last week again, the lost child was who? They were the disciples themselves who were getting their life from God, but all of a sudden it was getting from their performance now. Who's the greatest? And Jesus had to bring them back. He had to bring them back. He had to confront them with a discipline that said, you need to become dependent again. That was the discipline. He brought them back. you need to have that in your mind it's very important that we apply these principles to the right person not angry, I'm going to stay here and do what I want and I don't care what you say that's not who we're bringing this kind of discipline to a different kind of discipline is going to be applied to that person this is the wandering one, the wounded one who goes out there and goes, how did I get out here? how did my marriage get in such a mess? I hate this, how did I get involved in this affair? I violated my marriage and I'm broken and I hate this and I want to come home, but I don't know how. When your brother stumbles and they're doing real bad, go get him. That's the when, when they go astray. When they go astray. By the way, one of the things you need to get here, the when you go astray. There are degrees of going astray. I don't know if this works for you, but I get pictures. When I get pictures, I can understand it. and still all these theological concepts, Greek words, aren't they great? Pictures work. Cows in a field, you know? I was with my kids this last week and we got a movie, John Wayne movie, The Cowboys. It was great. It's the movie, it's an old one. It's the one where all of his guys are gone and so he gets a bunch of 12-year-old boys to take 1,000 cattle 400 miles across the worst territory you ever saw. Anyway. Okay, anyway, with this text, the picture in my mind wasn't sheep or little kids, and it's okay because Jesus was just picking whatever he got to. So I got cows now, steers. And as they're moving along, I see the picture of the body of Christ, and here we are, a bunch of steers this time, steers, whatever they are, I don't know, cows. And we're walking along, and we're mooing, you know, and every once in a while, one of these cows, they just kind of move just a couple steps. They get away a little bit, and that's not a big deal. They didn't wander far. They just got their eyes, if I'm making it spiritual, off a little bit, and they just get nudged back and they're just kind of back and then they kind of go like this and then they're back like this and you know these little guys these little 12 year old boys who they just bring the horse up and he's back in the fold it's no big deal it's just the course of life get a picture of church discipline happening that way in the course of life we're just kind of moving along together and in the course of a day you get your eyes off where they belong and you got a friend or a wife who kind of comes up alongside and goes hey hey hey what are you thinking and you're back in line, and you're back in line. It's all just the course of life. And then what happens sometimes is we hide a little bit better, or maybe somebody wasn't in relationship with us, and this thing that started with just a little look away, nobody bumped us back in, and so we just kept going and going and going, and all of a sudden that stupid cow is off in a thicket someplace, and if somebody doesn't go and get it now, it could die. The point is there are varying degrees of going astray. There is one element of this where the bringing back happens all the time in the course of life. Okay, when does it happen? When you go astray. Could be a big strain, could be a little step away, and you come back. Who does the discipline? Point number two. Whose responsibility is it to go and bring these ones back? If I were to stay with this picture of the cowboys, then the responsibility would be the guys on the horses, right? And the guys on the horses come along to steer and they bring them back. Now you've got to let the picture go because the metaphor doesn't work anymore. It doesn't jive with the text. Because there are no spiritual SS, Gestapo guys, who are going along making sure the herd's staying in here. Hey, go get them over there, you know. No elders who do this. Elders are involved in discipline. But I've got to make this picture wacky. You know whose job it is to bring the steer back? If I stay with the text, it's another steer. And when your brother stumbles, when your brother, who is a sheep, stumbles, You go and reprove him, and if he listens to you, you have won a brother. Who does the discipline? You do. Again, the picture is weird because you've got steers going, Get over here. I don't know. This is another little teaching thing here. Even the metaphors and the parables of Jesus, you've got to be real careful not to extend them to illogical conclusions. Keep them in the place they belong. Picture here, though, is that we are sheep who stray, but we are also shepherds who bring in the strays. We function in both roles, and we function in both roles all the time. This concept of you being the discipliners is vitally important. And I think it can hopefully change your view of Matthew 18 forever. Most of us, when we do think of church discipline, it's the way I described it just a minute ago. It's church discipline. It's big. It's heavy. There's some ecclesiastic gestapo whose job it is to search and seize and punish. It's what the elders do. If somebody did a Matthew 18, you know, yeah, we did a Matthew 18. You know, you kind of, yeah, we nailed them. You know, that means it went all the way to the elders. That is not what's going on in Matthew at all. in fact in fact there is at no time in matthew 18 anyway there are other places and i'm going to point to them later there's no time in matthew 18 where elders are even in view even when it says tell it to the church what we're doing is telling it to the to the to the assembly of the redeemed and that assembly could be a kinship group go get this guy we got to go get him and bring him back see when a brother hamartia when he begins to go astray you go to him you who know him go to him and say hey where are you going well you know i just heard you say something on the phone here and and and i can just the tone of your voice i can tell something's up what's going on those kinds of confrontations in the course of life is what matthew 18 verse 15 is about it's bringing them back it's bringing them back have you ever had anybody do that to you in the course of a conversation just give you a go, what was that, Dave? What are you thinking? And you're brought up, and you're made to think, and you go, oh, yeah, that was stupid. You know what just happened to you? You just got disciplined. You just got brought back. You started like a stupid stare looking away, and somebody went, oh, okay. Sometimes it's a gentle nudge. Sometimes it's in the course of conversation. And by the way, again, get this picture, church discipline, the elders. No. Kinship group. Bible study. Phone call. You meet a guy for breakfast. A support group you've got. Your best friend. That's where this kind of thing. And sometimes it's a gentle nudge. Again, you start thinking a little goofy, they give you a little bump back. Sometimes you're getting a little goofy and you're getting off track and they give you a little nudge and you don't pay any attention to it. Steers are pretty stupid sometimes. Cattle are. And they just keep wandering and sometimes you're walking along and they got to come up and give you a little smack upside the head, and then you go, oh, okay, now you're back. And the confrontation is a little more direct. I think you're wrong, Dave. You're going in the wrong direction, Dave. I need to say this face to face. The thing I want to give you, this happens every day, it happens all day long. You need to be disciplining all day long. You need to be disciplined all day long. Well, that sounds pretty radical. Well, let me ask you a question. How often do you go astray? How often do you lose your track? Well, I'm a straight shooter. I live on a straight line. Great. I'm not talking about going astray, going astray, and now your life is a wreck, and you're right on the brink of absolute disaster. I hope that doesn't happen very often. But the going astray, the stepping out, the getting your eyes up to focus, getting your life from something other than Jesus, how often do you think that happens? Every day. How many times a minute do you think, you know, happens often? One of the things that may dawn on you as I'm teaching it like this and you're thinking about it, you know, Dave, I'm hearing this and I'm not hearing it so much as it's our responsibility to go get each other as much as, you know, as you say it like this, it dawns on me that I do do this and I have this done to me all the time. Think of your best friend. Think of your kinship group, that person you meet for breakfast from time to time. And maybe it is that best friend and you can say anything to. Your husband, I hope. Your wife, maybe. You can say anything to them. They can say anything to you. And they love you and they confront you. And you've never thought of it this way before. But what they do is they bring you back and they bring you back and they bring you back and they bring you back. That's discipline. Healthy. If you don't have that, you're going to die. You're going to wander off and not want to, but you will. Boy, do we need each other. Don't we need each other? Another way to say Matthew 18, verse 15, discipline, would simply call it accountability. Accountability. Somebody who can be a mirror for me and show me what I'm doing, where I'm going, and give me a nudge from time to time. And if I need something more than a nudge, they can give me a kick and then whack me upside the head if that's what I need. Does that feel safe to you? It sure does to me because I don't trust me very much. You know, I know you better. I know me better than you know me and I'm an idiot. If I don't have people around me who are bumping me and nudging me and whacking me when I need that, I'm going to go astray and it won't because I want to or you but that's because I'm a sheep. So are you. We need each other desperately. That's discipline. The why of discipline. Why do we bring people back? Why do we do that? The purpose of a 15B, if you go and bring him back, if he listens to you, if this cow or this sheep or this kid listens to you and comes, you've won your brother. The reason we go get him is because we want to win them. Some of your Bibles say to gain your brother. That is a commercial term in the Greek. It means, it has to do with something from the marketplace and it refers to accumulating wealth. It means literally to win a treasure. You know one of the reasons I'm going to confront you from time to time? It's because I don't like you. It's because I think you're a jerk and it's really nice. I love it. Now see, this is how some of us have been confronted. You know, somebody will see you stumble and they love this position of superiority and they love to kind of condescend on you and it's wonderful. They bring their confrontation. You know, I just have noticed that you've been getting off lately and I just want you to know, in Christian love, of course, that you are an idiot and da-da-da-da-da. Some of us have been confronted that way and it grates on your soul. You feel like you're being raped. Some of you have been confronted like that. Let me ask you how it would feel if somebody came to you like this, and before they even brought their confrontation, they said, you know, Dave, I've been looking at you, and you know what I think about you? I think you're a treasure. But I see you walking away from Jesus here, and I see an attitude here that's hard. I see an attitude here that's rebellious. I see there's a stupid thing in here, and you are such a treasure. I just want to nudge you back. I might be a little more open to hear that kind of discipline. Why do we go to a brother or sister? Because we want to win and feel superior? Some people do. Don't ever call that discipline. That's manipulation and it's abuse. And the one who ought to get disciplined in that context is the one who's bringing the so-called discipline. Get it? The reason we're going to bring discipline and nudge people back is because we think everybody among the redeemed is a treasure. And we want you back in here where you can give who you are to us and we can be rich because of your healthy presence among us. The purpose of church discipline in Matthew 18 is to bring people back. It is to restore. The reason I want to really put a finger on this is because many of us, again, have this impression of Matthew 18 that ultimately in Matthew 18, if you go the whole route of Matthew 18, you're going to put people out. At no place in Matthew 18 is the end result of this bringing someone back, extricating them from the fellowship. It is at no place here putting someone out. Well, what do you mean, Dave? In verse 17 it says, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax gatherer. Even that is not putting them out. Let me give you the picture. Again, you've got to keep in line with what this context is saying. This is not someone who's in the fellowship saying, I don't care what you say. I'm going to stay right here and do what I want. That is not the picture. This is a brother or a sister who's begun to wander away from the fellowship. They've begun to wander away from the Lord. And we've gone out to bring them back. And then I sent two or three people to bring them back, and they just kept wandering. And then we said, church, we've got a brother or a sister who's wandering. Let's go get her. Let's go get him. And we finally came and found this person and said, come on back. We recognize you as a straying one, not a rebellious one. Come on back. And after all of that, they still go, no, I like it here. Guess what? My posture towards you is going to change. Until now, I thought you were a straying little one who was broken and wounded and bleeding, and I was wanting to bring you back. But now, with this attitude that says, I'm going to stay out here. I like it out here. I'm not putting them out. I'm letting them stay. See the difference? I'm accepting their decision to stay out there, and now my approach changes. You're no longer a little child who got lost. You're a prodigal son who said, I don't want to be there. And I didn't know that about this lost little one until we brought to confrontation. Get it? You're not putting them out. You're letting them go. So that in the letting go, they might feel the full consequences of their behavior and hopefully do come back. it says here don't put them out it says just let them be out there this is the point at which i have to stop in the sermon back off from the text and spend some time making a clarification because while in matthew 18 at 18 at no time are we dealing with an issue where you're putting someone out of the fellowship the whole picture here is going out to get a straggling sheep and bringing them back. What we need to be balanced with is that there are times when we do take someone into fellowship and remove them from it. Under what circumstances does that take place? And I'll tell you what, it is extremely important that we make a distinction between these two things because I am terribly concerned that in many of our churches what we're doing in terms of discipline is exactly opposite of what I'm just about to describe. Very often in our churches, the ones who are stumbling and straggling and wandered away, not rebelliously, but they got involved in grievous sin and now they want to come back. Most of our, many of our churches, maybe most of them, don't bring those people back. They kick them out. And the ones who need to be removed are allowed to stay. It's exactly opposite. And unless discipline is appropriate, go bring the lost ones back and kick other ones out. You're never going to have the moving of God in your church. Let me give you examples of people or influences that need to leave. 1 Corinthians 5. 1 Corinthians 5. I want to move here as quick as I can. I want you to turn to this. I don't very often have you bounce around in Scripture, but today I want you to. 1 Corinthians 5. I referred to this last week. This time I want to give you the whole thing. It is actually, the word there also is commonly reported that there is immorality among you, an immorality of such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles. And here's the sin, that someone has his father's wife. it's incest and here's your response you have become arrogant the picture here beloved is not of a wandering sheep who's stumbling in their sin they got involved in immorality and now they're going how did i get in this i hate this i want to go back but i don't know how i'm broken over my sin but i don't think i could ever go back to church they never received me that's the kind you bring back this one is arrogant i'm gonna do what i want when i want with who i want i'm arrogant and all the people were arrogant. They were not mourning over this sin. They were going, well, I don't know. Who are we to judge? I suppose, you know, we're really kind of broad-minded, I guess, aren't we? Yeah, we just include everybody. Anyway, this is not appropriate. Do you see how sometimes people stumbling in immorality are going to be brought back? In some of the most grievous sin, they're going to be brought back. Why? Because their response is, hate this. I want to get victory over this. I don't know how to break this. Help me. I got a real serious problem. But this one over here is going, I can handle this. I don't have a problem. This is great. I'm going to do what I want. That kind of person, Paul says this of him, in the name of our Lord. Verse four, when you are assembled and I with you in spirit with the power of the Lord Jesus, I have decided to deliver one like this to Satan. Whoa, this is a little different flavor than go after him, gently bring him back, deliver him over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh. What does that mean? There's a couple places where Paul says, I deliver him over to Satan. Well, it could conjure images of Paul calling on demons on that guy. I think it's more like this. I think he's saying this. We are going to, as a church body, put this person out of our fellowship and remove him from the spiritual protection of this body. Whether you know it or not when you're here when you're involved you are under the spiritual protection of the body here and we're going to remove him from that so that he can feel the full consequences of his sin we are going to deliver him over to the full consequences of his sin and by letting him stay we're all kind of pacifying him or her and think oh it's okay and you know what all that pacifying is really enabling the sin to continue they're not feeling any of the consequences for the behavior I'm turning him over cut him out and that's one of the ways by the way he's going to get restored but I need you to see something here as it relates to discipline Matthew 18 the purpose of the discipline was what? to restore to bring back 1 Corinthians 5 the purpose of the discipline at least the priority purpose of the discipline is not the restoration of the brother we want the restoration of the brother but you better know that the priority concern of one who is arrogant in their sin and staying in the body is the protection of the body. We are going to protect the body from leavening influences like this that can defile the body. Look at verse 6, your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough? Clean out that old leaven that you may be a new lump just as you are a new lump. And he starts talking about their justification. clean out the leaven because an influence like this allowed to stay you know what's going to happen? there's going to be a message sent and that is this, this doesn't matter sin doesn't matter and that sin is going to spread through your whole body before you know it that church is going to be overrun with immorality that arrogance I'm going to do what I want does not get pulled back that gets put out revelation 2 19 the same thing has happened in the church in siatira he comes jesus comes to that church and says i know of your deeds your love your perseverance your faith and your service but i have this against you you tolerate the jezebel who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads people astray even into immorality the fact of their sin and the reason god was going to bring judgment on that church was not because they were themselves teaching the immorality but that they tolerated someone who did. They tolerated someone who was teaching divisiveness. There are certain disciplines that need to be applied to the stumbling brother. What is that? We go get him. We bring him back. Bruised, bleeding, needing help, broken, hungry. We're going to pick him up and build him up and bring him back. There's another discipline that's applied to the arrogant. I'm going to do what I want and I don't care what you say. And you know what that discipline is? You're out of here. you know that sounds so hard doesn't it but I got that's what protection is that's what protection is okay that's all well and good how do you identify these kinds of things by the way there's another one I want to give you because immorality is an obvious one you know immorality is being leavened that's an obvious one you need to know that there are far more subtle leavening influences in the body that are just as damaging and maybe even more because immorality is one we would spot. These might be more dangerous because they're more subtle. Paul is just about to leave the church in Ephesus. He's been there three years. He's meeting with the elders and he gives them this warning in chapter 20 of Acts, verse 28. Be on your guard for yourselves and for all the flock among you which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with his own blood. I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. And then he clarifies, these savage wolves are not coming from the outside. They will come from among your own selves. They will come from inside the body. And they will speak perverse things to draw disciples away after them. And that's my question. Now, how do we identify who's a wolf and who isn't? How do we know who a stumbling brother is who needs restoring, so we apply that rightly, but who is a leavening influence who needs to be removed. The Word of God gives us help on that. As quickly as I can, let me give you some shots. Matthew 16, verse 6 and 12. Jesus warns the Pharisees, warns the disciples, beware the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. And in that passage in chapter 16, verse 12, they didn't understand what the leaven was until verse 12 when the disciples said they understood that he did not mean to say beware of the leaven of bread but rather the teaching of the Pharisees which was the leaven. The teaching of the Pharisees was what needed to be removed. What was their teaching? It was legalism. Remember that? External performance. Clean the outside of the cup and of the bowl but not having an internal reality of the power of the Spirit. Look good. It's up to you. Get circumcised. And if you do all that external stuff you don't even need the internal reality just policy outside of the cup that teaching of the pharisees is leaven and you cannot tolerate it don't make friends with the wolf get rid of it the galatians got leavened with legalism we talk about that all the time around here and paul's priority when he was going to these galatians who at one time in their spiritual life were walking by the spirit and experiencing the life of god not by externally following rules but by internally being dominated by the Spirit, the Judaizers came along and said, if you really want to do it right, get circumcised. Changed the whole focus of the Christian life to this external rule-keeping rather than walking by the Spirit. Paul's priority ministry in writing the book of Galatians was not the restoration of the Judaizers, though he would have desired that greatly. The ultimate priority in writing Galatians was to protect the believers from the Judaizers, Get rid of the Judaizers. In fact, chapter 5 in Galatians, verse 12, he says this, I would that those who are troubling you and telling you to get circumcised in order to prove you're spiritual would mutilate themselves. I would never say that. I'm much too nice. Why is he saying that? Because his priority concern is not the Judaizer. It's the protection of the flock. So sometimes we remove. You're going to remove arrogant immorality. You're out of here. You're going to remove legalistic teaching that is causing people to get their life not from Jesus alone, but from their religious performance. We're not going to make friends with that. You're out of here. Titus 1 says the same thing a different way. For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision. That's legalism again, external stuff. Who must be silenced. Matthew 18 is taking broken, stumbling people and bringing them back with all their bruises and wounds and healing them. And that same person who would heal a broken, bleeding person is going to come against legalism and arrogant immorality and root it right out with impunity. Beware the teaching of the Pharisees, which is legalism, and that's leaven, cut that out. Beware the leaven of the Pharisees. He says in Luke 12, verse 1, beware the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. That's not the teaching of legalism. That's the lifestyle of legalism. Looking real good on the outside, praying all the time, fasting twice a week, tithing a tenth of everything you have. All of those things are good behaviors, but none of it was born of the Spirit. Beware of that and cut it out. Don't tolerate it. Don't make friends with it. The problem is that we do. and I hope that at Open Door here we're getting better and better excuse me at not making friends with that but I think that is another example that is an example of disciplines that are wrong we push people out who need to be brought back in very often the stumbling brother is the one who gets crushed very often and the arrogant self-righteous one who ought to be the one being removed is doing the crushing on the broken stumbling one and they are the ones who need to get rooted out. Do you see that? I'm going to do it. I looked at my watch. I'm going to do it. An example, an example of where we sometimes miss the balance is in Galatians 4. You've heard it before. Some of you are new. You've never heard it. It's a key thing to the foundation class that I do. The difference between an Ishmael and an Isaac. Remember that? The issue in the Galatian church was that Paul came to them and they had lost their virility spiritually. They lost their power. And they were living under the yoke of this incredible performance bondage. And he looked at this congregation and he determined by chapter 3 this. There's two possible explanations for the impotence I see in this church right now. And there's two possible explanations for you getting sucked into legalism. One is that you're truly redeemed, but you've forgotten who you are. And so in chapter 3, he comes to them and he says, you guys need to remember, you are not slaves. You're sons. You're not under the law. You're under grace. You're not a bunch of rule keepers. You are a bunch of spirit-filled, spirit-indwelled people who can live the Christian life by the internal prompting of the Spirit. So quit living like slaves and quit living like you're under the law and start walking by the Spirit again because you used to do it. When redeemed people who have begun to live their life externally hear that kind of talk, you know what they do? They go, yeah, somebody just found me and brought me back and now I can let go of that junk and start living by the Spirit again. When externally religious people who have no internal reality hear that kind of confrontation, you know what they do? They go, because they're taking away all their external performance. and they don't have anything left. So he said one explanation is that you've forgotten who you are, but there's another explanation in Galatians chapter 4 verse 11, and that is this, that you never were really redeemed. You just established all the behaviors. Chapter 4 verse 11, he says this, I fear that perhaps I've labored over you in vain. The word labor there is not worked hard. It means I labored as in giving birth to a child. I'm afraid that you guys are spiritual abortions. then he gave an illustration of two sons Ishmael and Isaac Galatians 3 or 4 22 to the end of the chapter Ishmael was born of the flesh born of Hagar Isaac was born of the spirit and faith born of Sarah Ishmael was an illegitimate son having no claim to the inheritance Isaac was a legitimate son born of faith and was in line for all of the inheritance of the Father. In verse 24, Paul says, we are speaking allegorically here. So both of those pictures are of spiritual realities. There are people who have been genuinely born of the Spirit, of supernatural causes by their faith, not their performance. And they are the legitimate sons of God. But there are other people, and they're going to church every Sunday, who are illegitimate sons. They have not been born of faith. They have been born of their own performance. And there's a problem. One is legitimate, the other is illegitimate, but they both call Abraham their father. They both call God their father. They both call this their church. One is real and one isn't. And the problem in many churches is that we don't discern the difference between the two. And I don't think they're that hard to spot, by the way. They're hard to confront. Those who are not truly born of the Spirit are generally legalistic. They focus on externals because that's all they have. They are incapable of acting in faith because they do not have spirit eyes. They don't have spirit ears. They can talk about church politics, but they cannot talk about God. But not only are they incapable of acting in faith, they are incompatible with people who do act in faith. How do you know that? Because verse 29 says so. As at that time, he who was born according to the flesh, who is that? Ishmael persecuted him who was born according to the spirit, that is Isaac. It says this in the end of that verse, so it is now also. In the community of the redeemed, it's like a kingdom and there's wheat, Isaacs, and there's tares, Ishmaels. And Ishmaels persecute the Isaacs. They don't get along. My fear is this, that in many churches, you know how we handle that dispute? We give in to the Ishmaels. Accommodate them. They look real good. They fast twice a week. They give the tenth of all they have. They pray all the time, just like Pharisees. They have no inner reality. And we accommodate them, and we give them the upper hand, and we're intimidated by them. And in that kind of context, you know what happens to the one who wanders? They get crushed. They get kicked out, and the discipline got flipped. So what do we do with the Ishmael? What do we do with the legalists, the leaven of the Pharisees, which is their teaching, which is their lifestyle, which is captured in the concept of Ishmael, what do we do with the arrogantly immoral? We put them out. It says in verse 30, what does the scripture say? You cast out the bondwoman and her son. Getting back to the text, Matthew 18 talks about restoring people. It never in view is it putting people out. But the people we're talking about restoring are the ones who wandered away. could be grievous things. But it is an arrogant rebellion and it isn't legalistic hypocrisy that they're involved in. When do you do a Matthew 18 discipline? As soon as a brother begins to get his eyes off Jesus. You do it right now. Who does that discipline? You do. I do. We all do. The fact is every one of us stray and need to be brought back and every one of us need to be involved in bringing people back. Key thought on that is that it's a lifestyle. We're all doing it all the time. The why of discipline is to win the brother because they're a treasure. At no time does Matthew mean we put him out, but in the case of leaven, in the case of an influence in our body that is drawing people away, we're going to put him out. Hopefully they will get restored. In the case of 1 Corinthians 5, 2 Corinthians 2 indicates that person did hit the wall and was restored. and in that situation we welcome them back but when we're dealing with willful immorality legalism the leaven of legalism and legalistic lifestyles you put it out to protect the little ones as I close it's just closing with this my biggest concern as I've said all through this sermon is that very often in our churches we get the discipline opposite the little ones who've wandered off and need to be brought back are the ones who get put out and the self-righteous, legalistic, high-handed ones who need to be put out are allowed to stay and I've got news for you when that happens, the church dies I don't know what could be more important than something like balanced discipline that could possibly put the finger on why churches die. When the Ishmaels, when the leaven of the Pharisees, when the truly immoral are allowed to stay and rule, it creates a context where the battered reeds of Matthew 12 do get broken off and the smoldering wicks of Matthew 12 do get snuffed out. Remember that passage? Real quickly, Just close with this. It's speaking of Jesus and what he does. He says this, a battered reed I will not break off. I won't do that. I'm going to heal a battered reed. Remember the battered reed? It was a reed that grows up by the sea, and it's long, and it's very firm, and they would make flutes out of them, and they'd make music, and it'd be pretty music. But every once in a while, you'd throw the reed down, and it would get bruised. Every once in a while, somebody will get into a situation that'll bruise them, or it'll get moist, and it'll get a little soft spot on this reed. And what would happen with the reed is that doesn't make music anymore, and so often they'll just toss the reed. But you need to know that where appropriate, healthy discipline is being applied, and when Jesus comes and brings his kingdom, what happens with broken reeds is they don't get tossed off, they get healed. And bruised reeds begin to play music again where appropriate discipline is being played, where appropriate discipline is being administered. And smoldering wicks he will not put out. A smoldering wick is simply somebody who had the fire of God moving in him at one time, and now it got doused, and it's just smoldering. And where appropriate discipline is being applied to that person, it's simply another metaphor for bringing him back. It means the wind of the Spirit begins to blow, and instead of dousing that flame completely, you get fanned to flame. The wind of the Spirit comes, and you get fanned to flame. Where balanced biblical discipline reigns, Ishmaels get removed, Isaacs get restored, leaven gets cut out, and stumblers get brought back, battered reeds make music again, and smoldering wicks get fanned to flame. I think it's a matter of life and death in the church. We didn't have any idea how to close this. We thought all week of a song, couldn't think of a song. And so what we're going to do is just open this time up at the end for the ministry of the Spirit. How would we apply church discipline, as we've heard of it this morning, to our body today? Well, the only way I know that's consistent with Matthew 18 would be that we would ask the Spirit of God to come and bring back some who have gone astray. Ask the Spirit of God to come and begin to heal some bruised reeds and fan to flame some smoldering wicks. And just another thought, some of you are bruised because of your own sin. And you've gotten into some things that have really put a mark on your life. You need to know that where discipline is applied, you can be healed. That's discipline, bringing you back. But some of you have been bruised by someone else's sin. You've been wounded by someone else's invasion of your life. And you need to know that the shepherd is coming after you right now, and church discipline is going to be applied to you right now. Church discipline. Everybody's scared of that. Guess what? Real church discipline brings you back. It heals bruiseries. It fans the flame, smoldering wicks. Would you stand with me? I'm just going to pray. We're not going to have a song. I'm not going to have a song. I'm going to pray that the Spirit come and administer in this body right now church discipline. What is that? That bruised reeds get healed. That smoldering wicks get fans the flame. Thank you.
