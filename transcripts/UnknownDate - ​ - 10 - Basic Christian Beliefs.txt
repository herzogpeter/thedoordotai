We were talking last week about sanctification. Sanctification. I'm just going to review a little bit of this, and then we're going to move into new territory, finish up on sanctification, and then talk about the ministry of the church. And I hope I can leave a little bit of time open for questions that are still unresolved. Not that we'll resolve them, but at least we'll get a chance to air them. The sanctification, the Christian life. We discussed last week four views. Remember this? We discussed perfectionism, which is real prevalent in holiness churches, the holiness Wesleyan church, the holiness Pentecostal church. There's a strand of it in conservative Methodism. There's a strand of it in the church of the Nazarene, in the early church of the Nazarene. They're kind of getting away from that. The idea basically is that Christians can and Christians should attain perfection in this life. And there's a tendency to say that justification is based on sanctification. That is to say, God justifies you, declares you righteous, based upon how, in fact, how righteous you become, in terms of your experience. And in these schools of thought, you can lose your salvation because your sanctification doesn't make the grade. So the belief is that any kind of sin in your life, any unconfessed sin in your life, can separate you apart from God. Not just that it hinders your relationship, but it stops your relationship. It immediately puts you in danger of hell. And so there's always a need to be confessing your sins and to be living a perfectly holy life. And as I think I shared with you last week, the theology I was given when I was first a Christian was that any sin in your life immediately just shuts down God's love. And if he happens to decide to come back at that moment, you're left behind. And by any sins, they mean any sins. You're in a bowling alley. You're in any kind of a compromising place. They thought bowling alleys were compromising places. Jesus will just revoke everything that I've applied to you, and you're gone for. But it puts an incredible stress on the Christian. An incredible stress on the Christian. Because you always have to be worried about, have you confessed every sin? And you always have to be wondering about, are you doing sin now? And the only people who really succeed in these schools of thought are people who are very shallow. I've been in these schools of thought, and I've worked with a lot of ministers who are in these schools of thought. And the only people who really are good at doing this sort of stuff are people who are either so shallow they don't introspect enough to see how sinful their heart really is. They're so shallow in terms of understanding the motivations of their own heart that they really believe they are righteous. And these people are really confident here. As long as they do the external stuff, they feel they're okay. And these are the people that make good Pharisees. Or people who are so evil that they've completely lost touch with the Holy Spirit. And therefore, even though there's evil in their life and they know it, they don't feel bad about it at all. And these people can be shiny on the outside but very evil on the inside. And these are the ones who usually attain, usually get leadership in these groups because they're the only ones who are good at it. It's a scary thought. So you have the most spiritually immature or spiritually backward people being the leaders of the whole movement. And it leads for some interesting dysfunctional stuff going on. These kind of churches tend to be the most dysfunctional, the most uptight, the most neurotic, and a lot of bad stuff comes out of them. Then you have the payback time kind of sanctification. All your life you're to be paying back what Jesus did for you. After all Jesus did for you, don't you owe it to him to live a holy life? and so you're always trying to pay back what Jesus did for you. And that makes the cross into a giant credit card. The third one is the legal fiction view. And this is a fairly common Protestant view. The idea here is that God sort of pretends you're righteous even though you're not. And we say that justification means just as if you'd never sinned. And there is a truth to that. But if it means that God acts as though you had never sinned, and God acts as though you were sinless even though you're not, then it makes God into a pretender. God pretends like you're holy even though you're not. God pretends like you're righteous even though you're not. He wears Jesus' spectacles. And so it's sort of a legal fiction. For legal purposes, God will treat you as righteous even though you're not. This leads to cheap grace. cheap grace which is to say people who say well I'm off the hook God doesn't know that I'm a sinner so I can go ahead and sin your heart remains unchanged your internal life is not there but as long as you're off the hook you feel you're okay and so you get people living like the devil and not feeling bad about it they're not struggling with sin they're just living in sin and yet they feel they can have all the assurance of salvation I don't know if I told you or not but I've had several encounters with people who hold this position. The group that most institutionalizes this are the Southern Baptists. And it's not to say all Southern Baptists do this, but they have a belief in eternal security attached to a... Well, the way it works out in their system is basically that if you confess Jesus at the age of four, you can have total assurance that you're saved, and that regardless of how you live. So it's kind of cheap grace. And I met a guy who was living a horrendous lifestyle on drugs and shacking up with a number of different women. He was living with two women at the time who was perfectly convinced he was going, he was totally convinced he was going to heaven because when he was five, he went to the altar. Something's gone awry there. He wasn't struggling with sin. There wasn't anything in his heart that was regenerate saying, hey, this maybe doesn't please the Lord. And he wasn't wrestling with sin that was on him. He just was completely okay with it. And something's gone awry there. But he thought, Jesus, God doesn't know what's going on. God wears Jesus' spectacles. The fourth view, and this is the view that I want to espouse here, is a growing in grace view. And this view basically says this, that when God declares you righteous, when God declares you holy, when God declares you redeemed, you are in fact righteous, you are in fact holy, you are in fact redeemed. That when God says something, it becomes a reality. God doesn't play games, he doesn't pretend. When he says, let there be light, there is light. God's word is, as we say in theology, ontologically productive. God's word creates reality. He says it and it's there. God never has to pretend. It's reality. So God says to Mark, let there be my righteousness in him. And there is his righteousness in him. That's a for real thing. That's the truth about Mark. Let him be righteous, he's righteous. Let him be holy, he's holy. He's got a new heart. He's got a new heart. When God says it of Mark, he doesn't just pretend. He creates a new mark, a new reality, just like he creates light when he says, let there be light. And so Paul says that God said, let there be light into our dark souls, and there was light. That's the truth about Mark. Now, the difference between the recreation and the initial creation was this. When God first created Mark, when God said, let there be Mark, there was nothing to oppose that. God's word, out of nothingness came Mark. Mark was there. There was nothing to oppose it. Now, however, there's a lot to oppose it. God says the truth about who Mark is, but Mark has been living for a long time and has understood himself and identified himself in a way outside of the truth of God for a long time. And that isn't immediately annihilated. In fact, it won't be annihilated totally until Mark dies. So God's word now is true, but it's a truth that has to confront a lie. It's a light that has to confront a darkness that resists it. There's a new self here, but the old self still hangs around. So God's not pretending. What God says about Mark is really true. The problem's not with God, the problem's with Mark. Mark doesn't know it completely. He doesn't live it completely. he still struggles because his whole self-identity, his self-image, his way of relating to himself, his way of understanding himself, isn't completely transformed to who God says he is. His life process is the process of growing in the grace that God's given him, growing in the understanding of who he is in Christ. He's got a new self, a new heart, a new mind, a new orientation, but he's also got the self that was defined for him not by God, but by the world, by his parents, by his experiences, by the habits he's accrued, etc., etc. So I picture it like the doughboy here. Inside is the new self. That's the true self. God recreates you. That's the truth of who you are. But there's also what Paul calls this old self. The new mark is the mark that's led by the spirit. The old mark is the mark that's led by the flesh. And that's why the two are always warring against each other. The new self says, my total being, my self-image, my love, my orientation is defined by Jesus Christ. The old Mark says, no, the things of the world are what really is important. I live for the here and now. I'm a person, I am a physical man in a physical world. And I live for the physical. I live for the money, I live for the prestige, I live to get recognition or what have you. There's a new heart there, a new self. And so now, what was true about Mark becomes a lie. The old self is a lie. The old self is a self that defines itself as though it were not true that Jesus Christ was Lord, as though it were not true that God had made us new creatures in Christ Jesus, as though it were not true that he died on the cross for us. Living in the flesh is basically living that way. Living as though it were not true, that everything that's true about God were true. Is that right? The flesh is living as though it were not true, that everything that God says is true is true. Yeah, there's got to be a better way of saying that. But you get the point. The flesh ultimately lives as though God didn't do it. And so you've got to do it. This is the lie of Satan. This is the lie that's propagated throughout all the ages. This is the lie that comes across the boob tube of every commercial. Your life isn't found in Christ. It's found in every other thing outside of Christ. God says, your life is Christ. But the rest of you says, the old self says, no, my life is found everywhere else. And so those two principles war against each other. Those two principles war against each other. Now Romans 8.28 tells us that when you believe and when you've been regenerate, it's predestined that you will eventually be conformed to the image of Christ. It is predestined that all those who believe shall be conformed to the image of his Son. That's a settled matter. It's just a question of time. It's just a question of time. This life is the process by which that predestination becomes manifested. This whole life, the life of sanctification is the process by which the old becomes, is seen for being as dead as it really is. It's seen for being the darkness that it really is. It's seen for being the lie that it really is. And the new self becomes more and more manifested. That's the whole process of sanctification. One more thing. It's never about getting more righteous. Sanification sometimes is seen as that. Living the holy life. You get more and more righteous. You get more and more holy. You get closer and closer to God. That really is an unbiblical concept. The biblical teaching is that when we believe in Christ, everything we ever shall be before God is accomplished. You can't improve upon the righteousness of Christ. You are as holy right now, if you believe, as you ever shall be. I find it to be an awesome thought. You are as holy and as righteous right this minute. Regardless of what's going on in your life, you are as holy as you're ever going to be, as perfected before God as you're ever going to be right this minute. All eternity won't improve that. What will improve is the degree to which you express that truth. See, what's at stake here is not how holy you are. What's at stake is how much of the holiness that you are do you express. The old self says you can't express it. What we want to express is our carnal nature, etc. the new self says, no, what I really love is the things of God and the truth of who I am in Christ. That's what's going on in the process of sanctification. You had a question back there, and I kept on cutting you off. Okay, the verse seems to be wrong, doesn't it? If all things are passed away, why do they also hang on me? You've got, see, you're hitting upon a very good paradox in the New Testament. The paradox is this, and it occurs in a number of different ways. Paul sometimes says, you are saved. In fact, sometimes Paul says, you have been saved from the foundation of the world. Sometimes Paul says, you are saved. Other times Paul says, you shall be saved. There's a past, present, and future tense to these things. So also, Paul, sometimes the Bible talks about the kingdom of God having already come, and yet the Bible talks about the kingdom of God coming. The Bible talks about Satan having already been defeated, and yet it looks forward to the time when Satan shall ultimately be defeated. So also the Bible talks about old things having already passed away But Paul himself a number of times says how we have to continually put off the old and put on the new We live in a time of transition It's the already and not yet It's already been done But it hasn't yet been fully realized The truth has been proclaimed But our ears haven't totally heard it The reality has been created but we haven't totally expressed it It's here in principle, but not totally in our experience, in fact. So, it's true. In fact, Paul says in Romans 6, you are dead to sin. So, he asks, well, if I'm dead to sin, how is it that sin still has this hold on me? Well, Paul, right after saying you are dead to sin, goes on to say, therefore, consider yourselves to be dead unto sin, Romans 6, 11. The fact is, you're dead to sin. The fact is God's created you a new Christ Jesus, a new creature in Christ Jesus. The fact is that you've got a new self, a new principle of being that doesn't even like sin. That's the truth about you. Old things have passed away. But your experience is that you are so accustomed to the pattern of this world that you keep on living as though that were not true. All right? And so what needs to happen is for you to get your life to line up with the truth of who you are. So Paul says in Romans 6, 11, Consider yourselves to be dead unto sin. In other words, get your minds to line up with the truth. Quit thinking of yourselves as being underneath sin. You're above it. But you don't act like that. You don't think like that. You don't feel like that. The truth is what God says about us. The lie is what we say about ourselves. The truth is that old things are passed away. The fact of the matter is that we have to keep on putting that off because we haven't fully realized that yet. Okay? Okay, that's good. So it makes it sound like, for you people on the tape here, I'm going to recite this. The question is that it seems like then it's about us, and we should kind of be ashamed of ourselves because old things have passed away. Why do we keep on, you know, it must be about me. And so any falling in my life must be my fault, or it's about that. You know, that's a really, I think it's a pretty profound question to raise. you know the paradox is this in a sense it is our own fault I mean let's say that our sin is who else am I going to blame my sin on you know like Mark quit making me sin so in a sense sin is our own fault but here's the thing if you own that if you say this is really about me I'm a failure I'm no good that is the very thing that keeps you from understanding who you are in Christ. Man, can you turn up the music a little bit out there? We're having trouble hearing it up here on the third floor. See, the truth is that in Christ, you're loved, you're valuable, you're infinitely worthwhile, okay? And all growth comes from realizing that truth of who you are in Christ. So the thought that, gee, if I'm falling short, it must be about me because I have all the potential in the world not to be like this, so why do I keep living like this? Therefore, I must really be a bad person. That's the very thought that the enemy can use to keep you living like that. Because when he can deflate your self-image, deflate your self-love, he takes away all the genuine motivation you'd ever have to want to realize who you really are in Christ. But it's when we realize that in Christ, these things aren't true about us. That even though I keep on doing this, this is about my doing, not my being, because my being has been settled in Christ. I still act like that wasn't true. silly of me, stupid of me, someday I'm going to grow out of that and I'm going to struggle to grow out of that. But that's not about my essential identity. And the more I realize what my essential identity is, the more I separate my being from my doing, the more power I have to transform my doing. You see? The thought, I must really be a lousy person, is really saying my being is in my doing. I do bad, therefore I must really be bad. And that is the very thing, the more you think like that, the more you relate to yourself like that, the worse your situation becomes because you have no motivation. It's like the person who is trying to quit eating and they get depressed because they're overweight and the first thing they do when they're depressed is they start eating, which makes them more depressed, which makes them have less self-love to quit eating, which makes them chubbier, which makes them more down on themselves because it gives them less motivation. That's a vicious cycle. The way to reverse the whole thing is to realize that your identity, your worth, your value, your existence isn't about your doing or your looks at all. And to have a life apart from all that. We say, get a life. Well, there's a truth to that. Get a life. Get a life that's apart from what you look like and what you sound like and what you do. And you get that in Christ. And that's the true life. And when you get that, then you start to grow out of that. Okay, let's move in this. So this is what I call New Testament realism. New Testament realism. The New Testament realism is that you are really righteous. What God says about you is true. He's not pretending. He's not waiting for you to achieve it, as in perfectionism. He's not pretending. Nor is He waiting for you to pay Him back. You really are that. That's the truth of who you are. I got to... What is the deal here? Okay. If you look at the New Testament ethics, we've already covered some of this. I'm speaking in a very summarizing way here because I just want to give the essential point here. There's something profound about New Testament ethics. In the Bible you find a lot of, you ought to do this, you should do this, you shall do this. You find statements like this. But what's interesting about those statements is that if you look in the context, I'm not going to say every single time, although every single time this is presupposed, But usually it's not only presupposed, it's said explicitly that you'll find a statement of fact about you. You should live a certain way. Why? Because there's a fact about you. The way I put it here is that the ought in the Bible is based on the is. The ought is based on the is. What you ought to be is based on what you already are. In the New Testament, sanctification is based on justification. Justification gives you what you already are. Sacrification is the working out of that. And Paul, whenever he's giving oughts, like this is what Christians ought to do, this is how they ought to behave, this is what their attitude ought to be, he does it on the basis of what they already are. It's not a matter of getting a life, it's a matter of expressing a life. It's not a matter of getting holy, it's a matter of expressing holiness. So let me read to you Romans chapter 6. if this stuff really sinks in and you don't just think it theoretically but begin to apply it in your life, it has revolutionary implications. This is the passage I was talking about before, Romans 6. What shall we say? Then shall we go on sinning that grace may increase? Cheap grace. If God really sees us as, if God just sees us as being righteous, well, then we should just keep on sinning because he likes to forgive us so that grace may increase. Paul says, No way. Meginito is the Greek word. No chance of it. He says, we died to sin. Past fact. We died to sin. How can we live any longer? How can we live in it any longer? The fact is you're dead to sin. So the ought is, why do you keep on sinning? You don't need to do that. He reminds them of their self-identity, and then he instructs them about the kind of behavior that can flow from that identity. It's a matter of freedom here. He goes on. We've been buried with him, with Christ, through baptism, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead to the glory of the Father, so we also may have new life. Think about your baptism. You identified with Christ, you rose again in new life, that's what happened to you. Live like it. If we've been united with him in his death, we will certainly all see... Now, if we... Let's go on here. Okay. Now, if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, He cannot die again. Death no longer has mastery over him. The death he died, he died to sin once and for all. But the life he lives, he lives to God. And Paul has just told us that we are identified with that life. Jesus Christ, in other words, just like death no longer has bondage over Christ, but Christ now lives totally in the presence of God, so also sin. And the death it brings no longer has bondage over you. The life you live, you live to God. That's the fact. That's what God says. That's the truth about you. Forget every other voice in your life. that's what's really true about you. Then Paul says this, In the same way, count yourselves. The Greek word there means a reckon or to consider or think about. Think of yourselves to be dead into sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Okay, that's how you... Get a self-image based on the fact of who you are. And then verse 12, Therefore, now comes Paul's ethics. Therefore, based on everything he's already told us, Do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Christians ought not to obey the desires of the flesh. Why? So they can please God, so they can get right with God, so they can impress God? No! God did that for you already with justification. You shouldn't let sin reign in your life because that's what's true about you. Think of yourselves the way God sees you, and that will lead to the implication, and you'll struggle with it, but it will lead to the implication of, not letting sin reign in your mortal body. You see, sanctification, sanctification isn't about increasing bondage. We usually see it like that. Doing more oughts, doing more shoulds, doing more do's, getting holier. It's about freedom. Sanctification means freedom. I wish we could just call it freedom. First you're justified and then you're set free. You know, you are set free. God lets us out of prison and we gradually learn how to live out of prison. We're so used to being in prison, though, that we keep acting as though we were in prison. The truth is that we're out of prison. It's freedom. It's freedom. It's not, we think that, you know, boy, people in the world, they're free to sin all they want. They're not free to sin. They're bondage to sin. To be able to not do that is freedom. Huh. The New Testament mandate all comes down to this. The therefore comes down to this. Put off the old self and put on the new. Everything the Bible ever says is simply a variation of saying this one thing. Put off the old and put on the new. You've got this old carcass that's not true, that's a lie, that's dead, it's got nothing to offer you. Put it off and put on the new, which basically means let the new shine forth. Now, again, speaking in terms of reality, it's already happened. The old self is dead, the new self is new. God's word is true. Let God be true in every man a liar. if God before you is going to be against you. It is God that justifies. Okay, you're justified. But in our experience, it's an ongoing process, isn't it? Putting off the old, putting on the new. Okay? And every ought and every should is simply a matter of this. Give up your bondage and express your freedom. Give up your bondage and express your freedom. Live a holy life, which means give up your bondage and express your freedom. Realize who you are in Christ. Be liberated. hmm hmm okay and then I just put down a little of those passages later on Paul is always talking about putting on the old putting off the new alright Ephesians 4 22-25 Colossians 3-9 Romans 6-6 2 Corinthians 5-17 now here's what I want to talk about how do we do that how do you do that so we're going to get practical how do you do that you don't do it by more effort you don't do it by trying harder this isn't a matter of effort again, it would be a matter of effort if it wasn't already true about you but see, it's already true about you so it's not a matter of something you have to achieve it's not a matter of trying hard gee, I want to live a holy life so you're going to try and try and try and struggle and struggle and struggle the ultimate answer comes in this and God, help me to say this in a few words. All growth comes through resting. Resting in Christ. The key to sanctification, I really believe, is learning how to rest. Learning how to rest. Resting in Jesus. Resting in who you already are. Resting in His sufficiency. As you rest, you begin to express. The more you rest in who you already are, the more who you already are will be expressed in your life. It's not a matter of trying hard to express it, because that's your doing. It's a matter of resting in the sufficiency of what Christ has done for you. And the more you learn how to rest and be okay with that, the more you express. It's very much like our physical bodies. You get injured, right? You pull a hamstring, all right? I got tendinitis. I can't run now. It really bums me out. I can't run. doctor says no running for a long time. Maybe you should think about taking up a different sport. So, I've got to rest this thing. I can't try hard to get it fixed. I wish I could. There's a big race coming up in two weeks. I'd love to do it, but I can't do it. I can't try hard to make it better. In fact, trying hard to make my knee better by strengthening it right now makes it worse. And that's exactly how it is in the Christian life. The harder I work at it, the more injured it becomes. A tired muscle needs rest. It doesn't need more work. Tired souls need rest. They don't need more work. All the aspects of your being, the old self, all the aspects of your being that lead to sin in your life are the result of you being a victim of this warfare that's going on in this world. You've been wounded. You've been injured. You've been hammered. And so you have a hard time believing and identifying with the truth of who God says you are. You're a wounded muscle. And if you just keep on trying hard to be joyful when you're not, trying hard to, you know, appear victorious when you're not, you just get more and more injured. So Jesus said, come unto me all that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Because rest is what tired people need. And rest is what tired souls need. It works out like this. If you see it as a matter of effort to be sanctified, what you'll succeed in doing is faking it. That's the only thing you'll ever succeed in doing. The flesh can only fake it. It can only manipulate behavior. So if it's your job to make yourself sanctified, and you don't take this rest stuff seriously, you say, well, what we need to do is to, you know, and this is the message you get all over the place, in one way or another in different churches. What you need to do is to try harder. You need to be more committed. You need to read your Bible more. you need to witness more, you know you need to pray more, you need to praise more, you need to sing more. Why don' you become the church leader? Why don't we get involved in more programs? Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bam. Okay? If You do that, then You'll Be Right With God. That's the idea. All that happens is this. You've got a tired soul, a sick soul, that Leads To Behavior That Is Such That It's As Though Christ Didn't Die For You. Okay? As Though It Weren't True That You're Lovable And Valuable In And Of Yourself. You lead a life that, no matter how good it looks... it's denying the reality of who you are. Not only that, but the sickness and the things you need to be healed from, you have to go into hiding. You stuff them. You have to stuff them. Because if you're in a place that you have to look joyful, you pretend like you're not depressed. You've got to look victorious. You pretend like you're not defeated. You look wounded, or you've got to look sanctified. You've got to pretend like you don't have sin in your life. Which means you can never, ever, ever be healed of those things. The muscle that's injured gets more and more injured the more you try to fix it yourself. And that's what happens with us. The more we try to have the fruit of the Spirit, I will be peaceful, I will be patient, I will be loving, I will be kind. We end up just faking it and faking it and faking it, and all the areas of our life which need healing, which lead us to be not peaceful and unloving and all that other stuff, never get addressed. So we become sicker and sicker and sicker. Which is why I really believe that, you know, the people I worry about the most are the ones who look the best. I teach at Bethel College. You get students of all different varieties there. I don't worry about the kid who comes into my office and says, man, I am really struggling with sin. I worry about the kid in class who just has got it all down so pat, looks so good, looks so polished, is so holy, is a, you know, dorm leader and sings in chapel and all that. That's what I worry about. Because there's probably a world of pain and a world of sin that is just being swept under the rug there. What needs to happen is for us to rest. In the middle of your crap. If you can't be okay in the middle of your crap, you'll never get healed from your crap. How's that? Unless you're okay, unless you can rest with God's sufficiency in the middle of your crap, you'll never outgrow your crap. You'll dress it up and make it look pretty and make it look shiny, but you'll never get rid of it. You've got to be okay in the middle of your crap, which means being okay with your crap, which means other people are seeing it. It means God's seeing it. It's there. And being okay with that, it begins to evaporate. It's a lie anyways, right? You can become okay with your crap when you realize that you are not your crap. Crap is what you do. It's not who you are, because who you are is given to you by Christ. So you can begin to be okay with that by realizing that it's not part of your essential self-identity. And when you make that distinction, if my okayness is based on my being in Christ, then I can hang loose with my crap. I can tell you about it, I can tell God about it, and I can be very real with it myself, because I don't get life from pretending like it's not there. And that's the one thing that's healing. I grow, you grow in health when you're okay with looking sick. And that's the process. So long as you're not okay with your crap, so long as you're not okay with your sickness, until you can rest in the sufficiency of Christ in the midst of all the garbage, you'll never outgrow it. I gave you, I think, my testimony a couple weeks ago about how I had struggled when my first two years in the Christian life struggled with sexuality and trying to curb that. A 17-year-old kid who's got a certain appetite fixed from the age of 12, all of a sudden you've got to stop at cold turkey. It didn't work. Tried to do it on my own. Ended up just stuffing it. But it was only at the age of 19 when I realized, no thanks to any church, that I was saved and identified apart from all that crap, I was loved in the middle of it, that I began to get a life, a life that wasn't based on my doing. I got honest with God, told God what I thought, which was the one thing he wanted to hear. In this case, I was pretty ticked off at him. But then he responded with love. And so in the midst of my God hatred, in the midst of my church hatred, in the midst of my sin, I felt loved. For the first time in my life, I felt okay, even though I wasn't performing well. And that was the one thing that began to break the bonds of that. I began to grow out of that, seeing that, hey, I got a life. I don't need this crap. I don't need this crap. I began to see this crap. I begin to see this freedom to not give in to ungodly sexual desires is not bondage. I thought it was bondage. Oh, I don't get to do this. Now I saw it as freedom for the first time. I saw it as freedom. Because to not be able to abstain from that is really bondage. And that's what begins to help you grow out of it. You had a question? Okay, the question is, why do so many places, Christian places, buy into the behavioral stuff? That's a deep question. I think if you read the book, Spiritual Abuse, that Dave and Jeff just came out with. It just came out last week. It's all about that. The bottom line is that you get spiritual leaders who get their life from how things look, so that it's their job to make people look good. and therefore they propagate that and so Christians my job as a kid was to make my dad proud the job of Christians is to make their pastor proud or to make God proud or what have you which means that they become professional stuffers and behavior see also it's kind of nice because behavior is manipulatable I can if you get the right personality you can get people to do anything you want you have to up the ante give enough threats give enough rewards people will do anything. So you can control behavior really good, and so it's secure. You can measure it real good. This stuff in the heart, though, you can't measure. There's no way to measure this. You've got to be okay with crap. This means you've got to be okay with things looking ugly, because things are going to look ugly. When people get free, they look ugly. And you've got to be okay with that. And if you're getting life from how it looks, you'll never do this. That's when you become spiritually abusive. It becomes incestuous. resting in Christ the basic thing I mean about this and we talked about it several weeks ago is this having time this is what I find to be the pills that give me nutrition to grow having times where you spend just sitting and picturing Jesus visualizing Jesus come to you and love you and hear it from his mouth and see it in his eyes and feel it in his arms let him just pour on that love And for that moment, that half hour or that hour or whatever, just shelve all considerations, shelve all promises, shelve all concerns, and just enjoy His love. Just enjoy it. Just sit, rest, do nothing. Because that's where He defines your being apart from your doing. Put on some music, some candlelight, whatever, because that helps melt the heart, and just let Jesus love you. And make it concrete. Ask the Holy Spirit to give you a picture of it. So the more concrete it is, the more impact it has on you. Let Jesus come to you. And that resting is what I find really begins to rejuvenate the self, and that leads eventually to a different expression of behavior. Change the core, you begin to change the manifestation. Not immediately, because there's always that old self you've got to struggle with. But gradually. Yes. It will either screw you up or you'll get kicked out. Usually you get kicked out. Because all of a sudden you start, when this gets a hold of you, and you start being, your being is in what Christ gives you, you start having the freedom and the boldness to start noticing things. And you start blowing all the no-talk rules and don't-notice rules. And you start doing that, and people get very uncomfortable with it. And you start being okay with issues in your own life. And it's too indicting to everybody. You blow their cover. That's what Jesus was always doing with the Pharisees. You're blowing their cover. What's on the inside? What's on the inside? Okay. okay okay, I talked about that resting in your being will result in a different experience of your doing, and an example would be the fruit in the spirit, you know, and I can't go into this now, but the bottom line is that if you let, for example, love if you try to love, you try to become a more loving person, you grit your teeth you crank it out, you'll never become a more loving person, you'll become a good faker at loving you'll learn how to fake loving when you don't really love but your heart will never be changed and that discrepancy will result in other kind of weird stuff in your life. But if you just rest with the fact that you're not loving, right now you don't love everybody, okay, that's where you're at. That's your experience. But let Jesus come to you and begin to love you. Begin to love you. He'll begin to tell you that he's made you a new creature that does love. He loves you. Let him begin to see it, hear it, feel it. Spend that time resting in the Lord. Let him love you. As that begins to happen, you begin to love yourself. You begin to say, I really am worthwhile. I really am valuable. I really have self-esteem, etc., etc. You begin to realize who you already are in Christ. And that results in all of a sudden, you'll find yourself beginning to love different people that you never loved before. It happens. And it's not something that happens with effort. That's why it's called a fruit of the Spirit instead of a deed of the flesh. It's a natural outgrowth of who you are in Christ. Finally, the fight of faith. The fight of faith. 1 Timothy 6.12 says that we fight the fight of faith. I don't know. I just think this stuff means a lot to me. I just think this stuff hits me. I like talking about it even because it always reminds me again of what's going on. Every day you can just get caught up in the same old rap and you keep on believing the old things. It's good to remind yourself of it. As I'm reminding you of it, I'm reminding me of it. It's kind of exciting. The Christian life is a fight of faith. Sanctification is a fight of faith. It's not a fight of works. It's not about trying to crank it out. It's a matter of believing who you are. That's why it's a fight of faith. The task of the Christian life is to believe that what God says about you is the truth of what God says about you. So Romans 12.2 says, Be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Here's the problem. Mark's a new self, right? What God says about him is true. But Mark's also got a ton of lies in his life. He still believes the old way. He still acts like the old way because that's what's in his heart right now. That's the way he defines himself. What needs to happen is for his mind to begin to line up with the truth of who he is in Christ. Romans 12 says, Be no longer transformed or conformed to the pattern of this world. The pattern of what your mom said about you, what your grandma, what your dad said about you. Don't be conformed to that any longer, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. get your mind on this is the discipline of the Christian life filling your mind with the truth of who you are in Christ reminding yourself perpetually who you are in Christ what Christ has done for you 2 Corinthians 10, 4 and 5 talks about what we are to be about is the tearing down of every stronghold bringing into captivity every thought unto Jesus Christ. The implication there is that the main stronghold that the enemy has in our life has to do with our thoughts. The main stronghold the enemy has in our life has to do with our thoughts. Which is why Paul says, we tear down every stronghold. How? By bringing into captivity every thought unto Jesus Christ. If the enemy can keep you thinking like you're inferior and keep thinking like you're weak and that you're unloving and that you're unkind and that you're shameful and that you're no good and that everything that everyone ever said about you was true, the enemy keeps on getting you to think that way. Your life will be lived as though it were not true that Jesus Christ died for you. Jesus still died for you. You still love Jesus. You're still saved. But you're not going to be... The health and wholeness and joy and peace and more than conquering kind of life that Jesus came to give you will never be manifested because you keep on living as though none of that were true. And that's the stronghold that the enemy has on you. See? And so what needs to happen is for us, under the inspiration of the Spirit, to bring into captivity those thoughts. I hear all these voices about me. Greg, you're bad. Greg, you're this. I bring those into captivity into Jesus Christ. What does Jesus say about me? Mom, bug off. Dad, get lost. Mother superior, jump in the lake. What does Jesus say about me? Now, I got about 30 years of tapes to erase there, so this is no easy task. The one hand is the easiest task in the world because it's not a matter of effort. It's just a matter of saturating your mind with God's word. On the other hand, even that takes discipline because our minds naturally gravitate to the pattern of this world. Pattern of this world. Everything outside of Christ is the pattern of this world. Ephesians 4, 22 through 25. It talks about speaking the truth to one another in love. We're going to get to that in a little bit, so let's hold that one. Philippians 4.8 says, Whatsoever things are good, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are lovely, etc., etc., think on these things. Think on these things. There needs to be times where you rest in the Lord. Just do that. You rest in the Lord. spend time, a romantic date where you just get intimate with Jesus, let him love you, let him hug you, let him hold you, let him say to you everything he wants to say to you, and that stuff is true. And he'll do that in spite of wherever you're at. Be okay with your crap, let him love you in the middle of your crap, you grow out of your crap. But we also live 24 hours a day. What happens during that time? If your mind just gravitates towards who you are outside of Christ, and that's where your mind stays, you'll have a hard time ever expressing in your life the fullness of joy that Jesus Christ has made you to have because you keep on living according to the old self. What I recommend is this. Take a truth of who you are in Jesus. Take the truth of what Scripture says about you. Write it down. Put it on the refrigerator. Put it on the bathroom wall. Put it in the car. Put it all over the place. And say it, and say it, and say it. What really helps me is to take an area of my life, an area of the old self that seems to be hanging around an awful lot that I'm struggling with right now. Take a truth of Scripture. I don't have to recite it just like Scripture as long as it's a truth based on who I am in Scripture. And begin to say it over and over again, especially in situations where that old self tends to be manifested. So, for example, there are certain types of people that I have trouble loving. Oh, it's true. I know that comes as a shock to you, but it is true. And usually it's people who are... I do a lot of retreats, and usually people who don't like me at retreats are people who are kind of uptight. I like to call them anal retentive because they are. They see themselves as just being proper, though. They're proper people, decent people, conservative people who like things done the right way and are kind of into propriety. And going back to my junior high mentality and slicing them apart, because I was pretty good at it in junior high, you know, just kind of cutting them down. You worthless piece of meat. Do you ever, do you realize what a petty mind you've got, you slime? And it starts, there's a side of me that just wants to come out and do that, Just destroy them, you pipsqueak. But then I'm supposed to love them. I have trouble doing that. Thank you.
