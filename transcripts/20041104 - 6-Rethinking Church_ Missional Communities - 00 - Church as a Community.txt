Good evening, everybody. Thanks to both of you. Both my friends that are here. My only friends. I have two friends. Well, who's just joining us tonight? Can I see just so we know kind of how to communicate? All right, there's a bunch. Well, let me give you a little background of what we've been doing today. Our kind of overarching theme or goal has been to talk about the church as a community of the kingdom of God. And we started out this morning by saying that something that has been a big aha idea for me, and I know for lots of other pastors who I work with who have been thinking about this, is that one little bit of theology, if we can get it, can become a very, very major paradigm shift or lens through which we view our work and our life in the church. And that is this. The way I usually put it is to think right about being a Christian, to think right about being the church, we have to think first about the kingdom of God. And in first there, I don't mean just sort of sequentially first, but I mean first in terms of preeminence. so we have to think first about the kingdom of god and think about it rightly and if we can grasp that then that can be an adequate basis for reimagining our life as christians and for reimagining what it means to be the church or the people of god so i said that to my best understanding the the proper relationship between kingdom and church is this that the action of god the present day work of God, his ruling and reigning. Remember, we talked about trying to see the kingdom as primarily a verb and not a noun. I mean, it has noun overtones to it in that there's a sphere or as Dallas says, the effective range of God's will. So in that sense, it's perfectly appropriate to think about it as a noun. But I think for us as contemporary Christians, we need to add in the verb form of Basileia, which has in mind the present ruling and reigning of God. So there's this activity of God. And the activity of God, as I said sometime today, it has this rhythm to it where it calls the people out and then sends them in. And so it calls out the ecclesia. And then as the present missiologists like Hunsberger and, you know, who wrote Missional Church and others are saying, they're helpfully showing us that we're also a sent people. And so we're called out and we're sent. Well, it's the ruling and reigning of God that does that. The ruling and reigning of God, the extension of God's personhood, calls us into something which is being the sent people of God. So the kingdom is first, and the church, if you read basic systematic theologies, the church then is instrument and means. It doesn't mean that it's unimportant, but as I said this morning, it sort of rightly puts her in her place. Because, I mean, I've been at this since I was 19. I'm 48. That's almost 30 years. And I can't tell you how many personal disputes, disputes in small groups, disputes in board meetings, disputes amongst deacons could have and would have been solved if everybody had agreed that our primary agenda here is the kingdom of God and the Holy Spirit and what he's doing. So a misunderstanding of this has caused no end of relational and church pain. So even if we just sort of looked at it negatively like that, it is very important to see the kingdom is preeminent. The activity of the kingdom creates the church. The church is instrument and means. We don't extend the kingdom of God. We don't expand the kingdom of God. As I said this morning, we enter it, or the other biblical metaphor is that we receive it as a gift. and we become its people. And then in the second talk or the talk that Dallas was doing this afternoon is we then become the cooperative friends of Jesus. And I said to you this morning that I've kind of borrowed that phrase from Dallas and added my own verbiage to it that my personal sort of life's mission statement or image in my own head is that I want to be the cooperative friend of Jesus seeking to live a life of constant creative goodness through the power of the Holy Spirit for the sake of others. And that, I think, is a simple little way to carry around in our heads what it means to be people of the kingdom and what it means to be communities of the kingdom. So we've just been trying today to give us an imagination for what does it actually mean to think about church or to rethink church as a community of the kingdom. And then as we're done tonight, Dallas is going to talk about how there's a necessary sort of human element in this. And that is us pursuing spiritual transformation into Christlikeness. And how that both empowers personal and corporate life in the kingdom and informs it. It brings us more and more into the thinking or the work and the rule and reigning of God. And allows us to be ever more the cooperative friends of Jesus. All right, so that's kind of what we've been doing. And tonight, I know from the many times that I've talked about this that people afterwards ask me or write me and want me to say, well, can you describe what this might look like? And so I want to take a shot tonight at explaining or trying to give a vision for what a kingdom or missional community might actually look like. So to begin, look with me to Romans chapter 12, verses 1 through 3. And I'm going to read this to you from the message because I like the way Eugene puts it. But just as you're turning there, you might remember that as Paul often does, whether you think of Ephesians, you have three chapters where he's sort of explaining something. And then 4, 5, and 6, we're kind of told what to do about it. and it's kind of Paul's rhythm in his writing and when we come here to chapter 12 in Romans we're coming to a very similar place where he actually says as the text begins so look you know here's what I've been telling you now here's what I want you to do about it and I think this is a very very good again vision statement for what it means to be a kingdom person and to and to think about being a kingdom community. Now, one more thought before I read it. One of the things that's been the most helpful to me is that like most contemporary evangelicals, I thought of the spiritual disciplines or any kind of being sort of a kingdom person. I just sort of automatically, I think like many of you, thought of it as something that I was trying to add into what already seemed like a very busy life. You know what I mean? A very full, very driven life. I mean, like I said, I've been going at this, you know, full speed since I was very young. And so it just, I didn't know any other way to think about this. But then it was either Richard or Dallas or somebody gave me the idea, Richard Foster, sorry, gave me the idea that, no, the spiritual disciplines and sort of taking on this idea of being an ambassador of the kingdom and being a kingdom person isn't something that you add to an already busy life. This is something where we take our actual life and it becomes the grounds for our discipleship. So that the events and the goings on of an everyday life is the place where we practice this, both in the sense of the spiritual disciplines, which Dallas will talk about in a minute, but it's also the place, the realm of our actual daily existence is the place where we do this stuff. As I said this afternoon, we don't have to get on an airplane any longer to be a missionary or to think missionally, to think outward or to think otherly. We can do it right here. So that's why I love the way Peterson paraphrases here what Paul's saying. You can read along in the NIV or whatever you've got, but I'll read it to you here from the message. Here's what I want you to do, God helping you. Take your everyday, ordinary life, your sleeping, eating, going to work, and walking around life, and place it before God as an offering. Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him. Don't become so well adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking. Instead, fix your attention on God. And if you've read much of Eugene, you know that a constant theme for him is just the theme of being alert. Or if you've read Nowen or others, you see in the theme of much spiritual writings, being present to the moment. And this is what I hear in Eugene. Or for me, one of the things I learned from Wimber is being present to people or present to the moment, but with the Holy Spirit. So one of the things that John really taught us to do as young people, and by the way, I just sort of throw his name out there like that. He was the founder of the vineyard. I know he was somewhat of a controversial figure, but below that controversy, there was a lot of good, and I speak out of the good. And one of the things he taught us was to be present to the events of our life and present to people, but to be present with the Spirit so that we were trained to listen to somebody, like with one ear, and be listening to the Spirit speaking to us, as Dallas says, out of the air that we breathe, on the other hand. That is a major, major step forward for most people. So fix your attention on God. In the everyday sleeping, eating, going to work, walking around life that you already live, you'll be changed from the inside out. Readily recognize what God wants from you and quickly respond to it. Unlike the culture around you always dragging you down to its level of immaturity, God brings out the best of you and develops well-formed maturity in you. Now, what I hear in that last part is a corrective to the misunderstanding that if we really step into this new reality, if we actually really step into the kingdom of God, you know, I've actually had people say things to me like, well, I don't know, you know, if I do that, God may send me to Africa. Or, you know, I've actually had, you know, young people say to me, well, I don't know if I do that. God will probably make me marry the ugliest person in class. And, you know, we have like all these ideas about what will happen if we actually do that. When in fact, obedience or partnership or becoming the cooperative friends of Jesus, as we talked about whether we think about it as Adam and Eve or the covenant with Abraham or Pentecost and the church, Whatever that flow of history is where God has been wanting a cooperative people, that's actually the good life. That's actually the abundant life. That's what Jesus is getting at when he says things like, my commands aren't burdensome. And when we're done tonight, I'll read you a beautiful passage from Matthew 11 where he talks about, you know, I'm not going to lay anything ill-fitting or heavy on you. You know, come follow me. You'll learn to live freely and lightly. It's actually the good life. but that's not always intuitive for us to see it that way but this is what Peterson's getting at actually if you pay attention to God in your actual life placing it before him as an offering that that's actually the good life and that God will bring out the best in you and form a well-developed maturity in you so now thinking of that and probably you have a fairly easy time thinking about that with reference to your life, or at least somewhat of an easy time. But what if we turn that now towards thinking about the church, the local communities of faith that we're in, as being outposts, self-consciously outposts of the kingdom, self-consciously the people of God, self-consciously the ambassadors of the kingdom, you know, very self-consciously the spirit-filled people of God who are to be his cooperative friends in their actual life and and and placing our life before him as a sacrifice now Dallas alluded to this earlier and I did and I didn't say this but I think this is hugely important and this is something excuse me that I learned years ago in Dallas's book hearing God in the same way that we misunderstand the kingdom in the ways Dallas was saying I think we misunderstand eternal life or spiritual life in the exact same ways if you were to ask most people what is eternal life you would hear back either a chronological answer or a spatial answer and I'll explain that. Or a duration kind of answer. So if you ask most people what's eternal life, they're going to say usually, well, that's out there in time after I die. Or you'll hear an answer that has to do with duration. Well, eternal life is something that just goes on forever. Or sometimes you hear, especially young people or people who aren't so dialed into this, they'll talk about it in spatial terms, like it's sort of out there, as Dallas said, somewhere beyond the moon. That that's sort of where eternal life is. When in fact, as Dallas read this afternoon, eternal life is not chronological, though it has elements to it. It's not simply existence, so it has elements. And it's not spatial, though of course space is a part of our reality. But primarily in the Bible, eternal life is a different kind of life. It's a qualitative statement, not a quantitative one. And Dallas really helped me to see this, as I said years ago, in this little illustration that I love. Let's see. We need a prop. Let's say this is a palm tree. Are you with me? It's a potted palm tree on one of our patios. You got it? Everybody with me? Now, this palm tree is alive. But even if it were dead, it would still exist, right? Ever had a dead tree in one of your patio pots? Are you with me? It dies over the winter or something, but it still exists. but it's dead. Well, not this palm tree. This palm tree is alive. It has a certain kind of life. It's alive, for instance, with reference to the moisture in the air in this room, the temperature. It's alive with reference to the moisture or not in the soil, the nutrients in the soil. It's alive. It has a certain kind of life. Are you with me? Now picture up on the podium here is a really playful little white kitty cat. Got it? Can you picture her in your mind? I got a little red ball in my pocket, and I take the red ball and I toss it down that aisle over there. What does the cat do? Jumps down and runs after the ball, right? What does the tree do about the ball? Nothing. Why? Because the tree doesn't have that kind of life. It's alive, but it doesn't have that kind of life. It's dead to the realm of play. It doesn't have a life that involves play. Now over here, there's a couch and I'm sitting on the couch with my little daughter and we're doing flashcards. And so I say to my little daughter, Carol Ann, four times four is, and she says to daddy, 16. Well, what does the cat do? Do you think the cat stops and goes, I'll be darned. Four times four is 16. No, why? Because the cat is dead to the realm of mathematics. It doesn't have that kind of life. And what I always want to beg people, we had that question today about the nature of death to self. And the way that I've come to see that, I don't put these words in Dallas's mouth, but the way I've come to see that is that it's not some sort of Hercules spiritual thing that we do to die to ourself when in fact when God invites us through Christ to lay down our kingdoms and to in that sense deny ourself and take up our cross and follow him he is actually inviting us into a superior kind of life so it's something like saying when you think of eternal life or life in the kingdom it's like putting down our trenus and becoming fully human. So that as I said this morning, when you see Christ on the cross, there's something more going on than atonement. You are seeing humanity as God intended it. You are seeing the fully human one, Christ Jesus. And when he asks us to lay down our life and to pick up his life, it's actually the greatest thing that could ever be given to humanity. It's not some terrible life where we live like beaten down doormats or something. We lose all of our personhood as Dallas was saying. The exact opposite is what's true. We become the most fully human we can be as we give up our cat likeness and as we give up our tree likeness. That is the good life. Spiritual, eternal life in the kingdom is what we're being invited into and to call others into. Now, so with that as a vision, how do we then think about doing that within our communities? How do we help that take on a kind of corporate mentality? And the first thing I said this morning, I just alluded to it, is that if we were like Jay Leno doing man on the street, you know, kind of interviews and doing word association, and we ask most people to describe church, virtually everybody is going to describe it as either person, place, or thing. So they're either going to say, I go to some famous person's church. Who would we pick here in town? I go to Greg Boyd's church or I go to Leith's church. We would pick people who you all know who they are. And that's just common vocabulary. That's the way people talk. It's church who in their just honest imagination is defined by the leader at that church. Or other people, and this is not so common in our generation, but for others they would think of church as a place. So I grew up in Southern California, so you'd often hear people say, not I go to Schuller's church, where do you think they said they go? I go to the Crystal Cathedral. And, you know, I grew up just blocks from there. And so I heard it my whole life. So that's sort of church defined as a place. Or for people who come from more liturgical backgrounds, Catholic and Episcopalian and other, they tend to think of church as an event. And so you hear them saying, I went where this morning? I went to Mass. And that basically dominates the mental landscape of virtually everybody when they think about church. They define it as person, place, or thing. And as I said this afternoon, studies that I did a decade ago showed that the average kind of seeker church, and I said then, and I want to say again, I'm not putting anybody down. These guys are all my friends, and I was part of it. They're not putting anybody down. But what we discovered was that when we thought of church that way, that it literally dominated the mental and emotional and financial aspects of the church. So much so that in many cases, even up to today, as much as 80% of the budget goes into putting on that one-hour service on Sunday or a series of one-hour services. So what we're talking about here is not in any way displacing local churches. We're not in any way questioning the validity of local churches. What we're trying to do is think of local churches and locate them in a different story or place them on a different map or just give us a different mental model in which to think about them. Nobody here is arguing that they would go away, that they're bad or anything like that. But how can we just rethink of them actually, practically, not just give lip service to the fact that they exist as the instruments of the kingdom? so here's a here's just a little thought that came to my mind again um i think it was after having lunch one day with dallas and i was uh sharing with him kind of i don't know frustration about this or something and i remember he said to me well todd we need to learn to make to take serious and make use of the authentic communities that we're already in and that we have a tendency in the church, and I don't remember his word, and I've never thought of, I've never been able to settle on an adequate one, but we tend to make like temporary or pseudo communities out of our church life. And where my brain goes with that is I picture coming from Orange County, California, I picture cars driving in from about 30 minutes, and on a Sunday, that's about 20 to 30 miles away. And this is literally my reality as I was growing up, is that they would drive from, let's say, Whittier, past Chuck Swindoll's church, past Wimber's church, past Shuler to get to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel. But then some from the beach, they passed Warren, Rick Warren, they passed Smith, they passed Shuler, and they passed Wimber to get up to Fullerton to go to Swindoll's church. And I don't know what the right word for that is. If somebody could help me, I would be very sincerely glad. But whatever that is that we want to call community isn't actually community. You know, you go and you sit there in rows like this for an hour, and then everybody goes to the local restaurant and goes home 30 minutes away. And we used to actually measure the success of our church by how far we could attract people from. I'm serious. We would plot it on maps. And we would know how good we were doing if people were driving up to 30 miles away to come to our church. And so, you know, that was just reality. And then we decided somewhere, you know, when small groups became popular, that the really serious people in our community, they came to home groups. But I saw the exact same phenomenon happen. Now somebody was driving from Whittier to Mission Viejo to go to home group, and somebody from Mission Viejo was going to Long Beach to go to home group. And again, they're driving 20 or 30 miles to sit with another group of people for an hour and a half and go back to their life. And all the while, they ignore their sleeping, eating, going to work, walking around life in the place where they actually have community. So that little conversation we had sort of put me on to a few weeks or a few months of studying and thinking about community. And one of the big aha moments for me was this. that community, sort of by definition, you know, if you read any kind of sociology or anthropology or something on a community, by definition, it means routine, unplanned for contact. So you just think through in your life, who do you have routine, unplanned for contact with? In other words, see, if you have to plan for it, be it a certain corner of 5th and Main at 10 o'clock on Sunday morning, and that's all there is to it, then by definition, that's not really community. Or if it's being at somebody's house on a Wednesday night at 7.30 and that's all you ever see of them, that's not an adequate way to think about community. So if you just think, who do I have routine, unplanned-for contact with, every single one of you is going to answer back to me, neighborhood, work, or school. Now, a person's neighborhood could be a nursing home. It could be a college dormitory. It doesn't matter what it is. but you're going to say back to me 99.9% of you you're going to talk about neighborhood place of work or school and that just started giving me a vision and the thing that I was working with in the last church that I started for just reimagining church and so let me give you the the way this sort of came to me pictorially so I don't know if we'll get the camera angle right here but Thank you Dallas Oh there it goes Okay They taped it This is high tech We have tape marks there Like you do on a stage Tape marks there for the Nice work guys Alright So if you think of church As I was saying Person Place Or event In my lifetime, the best of these churches saw this and they tried to be outward. But they were outward working from within this basic paradigm or model, not in any way challenging it or wondering if there are alternatives to this. So I looked at that and said, all right, well, what are the options here? And what I came up with, just in my own mind, was something like this. These represent actual communities where people already live their life. So these represent Christians in various sizes of groupings in various places in society. And so I pictured half a dozen nurses who work on the floor of a hospital. And they say to themselves, we're a little Christian community. And our mission field is the sixth floor of the hospital. This is where we seek to live our actual getting up, going to work, walking around, sleeping life. Hopefully not sleeping on the job. Sleeping life. We try to actually present this life to God as a sacrifice. Understanding that that sacrifice is like giving up Trinus. It's not some big deal. It's the good life. It's the abundant life. It's life as God intended humans to live it. It's the abundant life. It's the full, really good life. And so they take it on. Not as some negative, oh my gosh, I don't know how I can do this. but they just sort of take it on. Or here's one guy maybe who, maybe he works in a parking garage and he just watches that arm come up all day and take tickets from people and hand them change. But he gets this idea. You know, I think I'm gonna just start praying for people as they come out of the garage. They won't know anything about it. Just between me and God. As each person goes by, I'm gonna pray for them. So he gets in the habit of doing that and one day somebody drives out. They're obviously very troubled and he says to them, sir, are you okay? And he says, no, I'm going home because my wife just got her mammogram results back and they're thinking that she has stage three or four cancer. Actually, I'm not okay. And he just simply says, what's her name? Oh, her name's Ann. Okay, I'll be praying for Ann. And he prays for Ann and something wonderful happens for Ann. The guy comes back through, he sees him a couple weeks later, he's beaming. You know, well, what, what's going on? Tell me the report. well we don't know what happened but she went in to get a you know a sonogram so they could locate exactly where the tumor was and they went to do it and they couldn't find it you know with that's that's this guy taking his actual life not adding some further busyness to it but taking his actual life and doing it or here's um five policemen who who work in a police department somewhere or four firemen or seven executives who work in a high rise somewhere. And you can just see where this is going. Now these people, they still periodically come together in what we would think of as church. But church no longer dominates the mental landscape and emotional landscape of their life. This dominates it. That's where they think of living their actual life out for Christ. Now they still do it in church. There's still plenty of room for the Pauline vision of people like us coming together as a congregation. And as he says in 1 Corinthians 12, verse 3, I think it is. You know, Paul says there's many gifts in the body of Christ. Many different manifestations of them. And that word manifestations in the Greek is very, it's a very playful, wonderful word. It comes from the stage, and it would call to mind for the first hearers, like a marionette moving over a crowd of people. And so Paul's seeing that as the people of God come together, in 12, 13, and 14, he must say six times, when you gather, the NIV has it, or other translations, when you come together. So Paul's clearly seeing a congregation of people coming together, and he sees the Spirit moving on various ones of them, and they mutually edify each other as the Spirit moves among them for the sake of living their actual life in the world. So never think that when you start taking seriously the Spirit or the kingdom, the church goes away. Think that it gets reinterpreted against the backdrop of the way we deal with modern forms of church or contemporary forms of church. That's what's really going on. Now, the other thing that comes into play here that's very important is what I said this afternoon, but let me say it again in this context. You can only do this if your sense of vocation is to be an apprentice of Jesus. As long as we live in the kind of sacred secular dualism, that church or morning devotions or small group is where I live out my sacred life. And this is kind of my secular life. We will never achieve that vision of Romans 12, 1 through 3. The vision, the important vision of Romans 12, 1 through 3 is that we take our actual everyday ordinary life. And we make it the grounds for or the soil for our own discipleship, the places where we can practice the kinds of things that Dallas was talking about this afternoon. So literally in my life, I mean, just to be candid with you, my sense of spiritual disciplines, they evolve. Like a few years ago, my basic sense of spiritual discipline was to control my appetites. Because I realized I was often medicating my pain or frustration or depression or whatever I might be going through. I was often, in fact, most of the time, medicating myself with food. And so it's sort of the opposite of what Dallas was talking about with fasting. It became, if I was happy, it was the way I rewarded myself. If I was with a group of friends and feeling like fun, that meant eat chocolate cake. You know, if I was depressed, that meant a chocolate malt. Are you with me here? It became the basic way that I related to life when I had any kind of more than flat emotional state. So whether I was up or down, it's the way I was relating to life. And so I think it was about a two-year period that all I really did in terms of my sort of main focus for my own spiritual disciplines was to get a handle on that. And I felt very peaceful and comfortable in it because I knew that it was harming me to really be present to life, you know, in that way that we've been talking about. Present as a spiritual being filled with the Spirit, self-consciously an ambassador of the kingdom. them now uh the next phase after that and it actually goes pretty much up to today is i've just been practicing one main discipline the discipline of submission now here's the way so put those two things together i try to practice the presence of god moment by moment and i try to practice the discipline of submission because i know those are my issues so i'm not kidding. If I'm going to place a phone call, or if a phone call is coming in, I will often just whisper to myself, Lord, may the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in your sight on this phone call. Or some young pastor's calling me, you know, full of angst about something. I'll just often whisper, Lord, help me really be present to him or her. You know, help me just be your ambassador here. If he has something I should say or do, let me know. So I just practice it as Dallas was saying this afternoon it not being about me and there's actually a long story there that I that I don't think I have the time to tell you but basically I had never heard of the discipline of submission until about four or five years ago I invited Richard Foster to come speak to a group of vineyard pastors and it was the end of the day and Richard didn't have time to cover it and he just said you know basically this discipline of submission is just you know routinely, as Dallas was saying this afternoon, make yourself not be in control. You don't have to be in control anymore. You don't have to have your way. And so I just practice that. I take every opportunity I can, whether it's with one of my children or my wife or the daily events of my life, I take every opportunity to practice that. Because I just find that it makes me more present to God and more present to the actual events of my life. But you see how this can capture that for all of us, not just for me. You could do the same thing in a committee meeting at USC or a board meeting here at the church or when the faculty is getting together at your junior high or whatever. This can all be practiced anywhere if we keep before us this vision of our actual life being the grounds for both our discipleship and our ambassadorship. That's the big important vision. Now here's what I found working with young or what would often be called postmodern people or that kind of thing. We have a friend who lives on the block and on Tuesday nights we have just like a contemplative group where we just get together and we have a meal and we have, you know, maybe somebody says a little something and we always have communion but it's basically just a night that we set aside for quiet and we do it together and one night we were sitting around having a meal and there was a handful or half a dozen of young people there in their 20s and they got into a very serious really honest discussion about is premarital sex wrong and like why would it be wrong like what is the big deal about what body part rubs with another body part and how do you know which ones are legal and you know like our lips okay hands hands wear you know how do we know what like what is really the deal here i've heard similar things about drugs and alcohol i just have heard it over and over and over again and a few years ago i just i just stumbled onto this reflecting on john 14 where Jesus, you know, this is the upper room discourse. He's about to have the last meal with the disciples. And you all know the story. Takes off his outer robes and gets a towel and he washes the disciples' feet. And he says to them, now look, I've set for you an example of what it means to be a Christ follower, what it means to be fully human. And I started calling that in my own mind the sacred order of the towel. And I started casting this vision in my last little community of faith down in Southern California that we wanted to be a part of the sacred order of the Tao, the cooperative friends of Jesus, seeking to live constant lives of creative goodness through the power of the Holy Spirit, not legalism, nothing to do with merit, but joyfully picking up our fully humanness and letting go of treeness and doing it joyfully through the power of the Holy Spirit for the sake of the least and the last and the lost. And here's what hit me. Just out of the blue, I shared this with some kid at a coffee shop somewhere. I said, well, you know, I think the issue there was drugs. And I said to him, well, you know, you just kind of have to fundamentally decide what is going to occupy your hands. Because you can't have the towel of the Lord in your hands and washing the feet of the least, the lost, and the last and simultaneously be smoking dope. You can't be sexually using somebody for your own utilitarian reasons and be simultaneously serving them. You have to decide. And suddenly, you know what I stumbled into? A way to talk about sin that made sense to contemporary or postmodern people. Because what it did is it put sin in a context. And we were no longer talking about sort of abstract moralisms about what part of a body can touch another and still be legal. But it suddenly made them realize that, oh, sin, in the same way that atonement arises in a context. Remember, we talked about that this morning, where we said that Jesus being utterly unique to this story is not odd. You know, he connects all the dots before him all the way to creation, and he connects all the dots in the future to completion or telos or the new heavens and the new earth. So he's unique to that story, unspeakably unique, but he's not odd. And what I found was a basis to show them that they had to decide, were they going to be on the floor of a high rise with a bunch of businessmen and occupy themselves as members of the sacred order of the towel? Or were they going to use people? Were they going to manipulate people? Like, what is it that you're going to actually do in your human interactions? Because you're going to have them. And suddenly, I was able, to my surprise, to locate even sin on a map that made it made sense to people. So that they could then start moving away from it. Or as I put on the diagram this morning, putting it positively, as they go through the process of repentance, of rethinking their whole life on the basis of the fact that they're invited into this reality, away from Trinus, and into being fully human by the power of the Spirit, it gave them a vision for letting go of one thing and picking up another reality. Because they saw that being an apprentice of Jesus was their vocation. Their vocation was not a stockbroker. That's what they did to get a paycheck. Their vocation was, I'm an apprentice of Jesus. I'm learning to live, I'm learning how to live my actual life as he would live it if he were I. That's my vocation. Now see, when somebody can grasp that vision and when a community of faith, a whole community like us can grasp that, suddenly everything gets relocated on a different map. And like a little zipper, what I found is like, think of a jacket or a sweatshirt with a zipper up the front. When we can do this, it's like all of a sudden, all these things that have been disjointed little theological tidbits or moral abstractions about ethics, they suddenly all just kind of zip up together. And it makes sense. And you find, oh my gosh, the narrow road is the good road. This is what I was created to be on. And it does involve a submitting, as Dallas teaches us, of our kingdom to the kingdom of God. But again, back to the illustration of eternal life or life in the spirit or life in the kingdom. When we lay down our life or place it under the kingdom, we don't become less. We become fully human. As I said this morning, Jesus' closest followers, they saw this. And they tore roofs open with holes to get their sick friends in the presence of reality of the kingdom of God. Blind people called out from the streets when they were being told to shut up because they got it. The centurion got it. The woman with the issue of blood forcing through the crowd, she got it. The parable of the treasure buried in the field or the pearl of great price. These are parables that are designed to show us how normal people react when they see the goodness of becoming fully human and laying down their treeness. Or when they see the goodness, the rightness of what God wanted of us having one vocation, no matter what our life is, of being an apprentice of Jesus. when they see it, they just arrange all the affairs of their life. They sell all the pearls they have to get this one. Or if they're a real estate agent, they sell all their holdings to get this parcel of land that has this treasure buried in it. So here's what I found in the vision that I'm wanting to put before you this evening. is that church doesn't go away. And I'll just say to myself that I was like major busted, I don't know, six months or a year ago. I was, I don't know why, I'm sort of embarrassed to say this. I was with Eugene Peterson, and he said to me, Todd, you are going to have to lay down your lifelong fixation, your neurotic fixation about fixing the church. Leave it alone. You're just not going to fix it. And you're fix it, you know, because I was explaining to him that I actually have lived my whole life you know reading all the church growth literature and you know and reading all the sort of contemporary sociological studies of the church and all that I've spent my whole life like trying to make the church relevant and you know sort of fix her and all that and what some of these people like Eugene and Dallas and Richard and others have helped me see is that God is at work in all these beautiful little ways that I just can't fix. The kingdom is so much bigger than me. And the kingdom is alive and is alive and at work in all of these ways that we just have to, I think I'm not the only one who needs to sort of let go of our fixation on church as it's defined by person, place, or thing. Because can you see, that's what I was trying to fix. But that's like fixing a fundamentally flawed paradigm. Are we connecting here? Versus kind of rethinking the whole thing, letting church sit there. These people still come together routinely the way we think of it. And then on Paul's vision, trying to do mutually edifying things through the gifts of the spirit so that we live our actual lives as apprentices of Jesus through the power of the Spirit. Now, so let me, I'm just, last thing I'm gonna say is, so let me give you sort of a report from the battlefield. There are young people all over America for whom that is becoming increasingly intuitive. And they are actually making communities like this. That they kind of, they have, There's sort of a mix of monasticism and this idea of being missional. And as Dallas was showing us this afternoon, those two things are completely integrated. But that's not intuitive, especially for young evangelicals. So they actually think, and again, not putting anybody down, but it actually feels to them like they're inventing something new. Because against the backdrop of their life, it's what it feels like. So what they're doing is that they're gathering together in neighborhoods or wherever they have natural connections. And they're forming these communities of faith. They're taking up as their life's vocation becoming apprentices of Jesus. And then trying to live their actual life out as the people of God. Now it's not very well seen yet. It's mostly under the radar screen. But it is literally happening all over the world. As they practice coming together to do this business of mutual edification, to study the word, to do the kind of things we do, but they do it for the sake of it informing their actual life, not becoming their religious life. So if you look at the, I don't know if you still have the diagram in front of you, and some of you just got here tonight, so you might not have it. But if you got that diagram there in front of you, I don't know when it says I did that. It was like 2001 or something. But just a few weeks ago, I discovered this little verse, again in the message in John 5, where, you know, if you look again at the diagram, here, if you look again at the diagram, look at that. You know, we have, you know, as I demonstrated, you know, sin as living in an alternative story, something that's different than the reality of God, you know, so that, and that that kind of life has its own telos, it has its own end, as I say here, in Gehenna, or the ultimate wasted life, it has a certain end. Well, I discovered this passage in John the other day that I just love. You know, this is the, in John 4 and 5, Jesus says several times, hey, look, guys, I only, whether he's being challenged or teaching his disciples, he says, look, I only do what I see the Father doing. And I only say what I hear the Father saying. And when the Father's working, I work. And when he's not, I don't. So now Jesus is one of those times again where he's explaining this. And he says, it's urgent that you listen carefully to this. Anyone here who believes what I'm saying right now and aligns himself with the Father has at this very moment the real lasting life. Now, what do you suppose Eugene's paraphrasing there? When he says the real, just think of these adjectives. The real, and think about what Dallas was teaching this afternoon. Anyone who hears and sees what I'm doing and aligns themselves with this reality, has at this moment, what do you think the NIV says there? Eternal life. But Eugene gets it. It's a quality of life. It's not simply duration. It's not simply chronological. It's not simply spatial. It's real, lasting life and is no longer condemned to be an outsider. And then just as we finish tonight, or at least as I finish, I want to read you these words from Matthew 11. We started with this vision of taking our actual sleeping, getting up, workaday lives, placing them before God as an offering. It becomes the grounds for our discipleship and our ambassadorship. Well, this is the section in Matthew 11 where Jesus has been kind of denouncing the cities where he's been and worked and who didn't really hear him or repent. So now Jesus turns and he resumes talking to the people, the people who are following him. But now he's speaking tenderly. And he says, the Father has given me all these things to do and say. So now just picture Jesus' actual getting up, going through daily life day, and doing and saying these things. As he says in John, I only do the things and say the things I hear my father saying and doing. So here he says, the father has given me all these things to do and say. This is my vocation. This is a unique father-son operation. And it comes out of father and son intimacies and knowledge. This gets to what Dallas was pointing out this afternoon in John 17, three. Or as I said this morning, that to be converted or to be saved means to be invited into the family business of the Trinity. That whatever it is that the Trinity's up to, the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, we get caught up into that and it becomes our sense of being. So this is a Father-Son operation full of Father and Son intimacies and knowledge. No one knows the Son the way the Father does. nor the father the way the son does. Now this is the part that I want to place before you tonight as sort of the bookend vision for how all this can work. Jesus says, but I'm not keeping it to myself. I'm ready to go over it line by line with anyone willing to listen. I read that and I don't know how long ago, But I instantly pictured in my mind one of Henry Nowen's definitions of the spiritual disciplines. Nowen says it's just like making space in your life for God to speak and act and for you to hear him. And when I heard that of Nowen, I immediately pictured in my mind my then very small son. He's now 19. But like most little boys, you know, he would get out a gajillion toys. You know what I mean? You go look in your kid's room when he's two or three and just surrounded with toys. But then, you know, they look up and they see the erector set. And what do they do? What can you picture a little two or three-year-old boy doing? Do they carefully pick up the toys and put them away? No, what can you see them doing with their arms? Just, you know, making space around them for this new thing. And that's kind of what I hear Jesus saying. I'm willing to go over this line by line with anybody willing to make space in their actual life for me. not just marginalize me to Sunday morning or Wednesday night or a little 15-minute devotional time in the morning, but who's willing to just like sort of go with me or take me into their actual life. I'm willing to go over it line by line with anybody willing to listen. Then he says, are you tired? Are you worn out, burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you'll recover your life. see what breaks my heart these days more than anything as a pastor is watching people trapped in catness or treeness and unable to see that there is any alternative when jesus said levi come follow me he was inviting him into a superior kind of life where levi could be fully human zacchaeus come down out of that tree jesus is inviting him into a more fully human life. Humanity as God intended it. The woman at the well got it. Come see the man who like delivers me from this bondage to men. As Dallas said this afternoon, she was then able to enter the kingdom in a place, in a sphere in which she is completely safe and secure and no longer has to give herself to men to survive economically in her culture. She could be free. So Jesus is saying, are you tired of all that? Tired of the ways you have to secure yourself? Tired of trying to run your own kingdom? Get away with me and you'll recover your life. I'll show you how to take a real rest. And when I read that, I think not the rest of drugs, not the rest of pornography, Not the rest of utilitarian relationships where you manipulate people to get what you want out of it. Thinking that this will somehow give you rest. It'll somehow make you feel alive. Jesus says, come follow me and you'll take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me. Watch how I do it. And then this may be, for me, my favorite line in all the message. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. Let me just give you another report from the field. A life that routinely does the discipline of submission, let me tell you, it is the good life. It is the amazing, peace-filled, centered life. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me, and you'll learn to live freely and lightly. So this is the vision, that both personally and corporately, we take our actual, everyday, ordinary life, we place it before God as an offering, we create communities of faith that have the same vision and do the same things, and in the end, what we live, what we end up with, is the free, the light, the real, lasting life. We become humanity as God intended it. And not just for this life, but as Dallas said, Revelation 22, 5, for the life to come, ever growing in these rhythms of grace with God as his people for all time. Amen? Amen. Amen
