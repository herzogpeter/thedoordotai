Let's pray together as we go to the ministry of the word this morning. Father, I pray this, that you would open wide our minds and open wide our hearts to the big story that is the kingdom of God and the king of that kingdom who is Jesus. Help us see things from the perspective of eternity as we once again retell this story of your coming and your conquering an entirely different way. Help us not only to understand the story but to enter into it and see ourselves as in it. In Jesus' name I pray, amen. I'd like you to open your Bibles to the Gospel of Luke, the second chapter, the first verse. We're going to begin something today that actually we're not going to finish until next week, this sermon, so I won't finish it until next week. I will let you go home though so you don't have to stay at all time. As we focus our attention for just a couple of weeks to issues surrounding Advent, but let me begin with a confession of sorts this morning, that I fear I'm becoming a bah humbug kind of person around this kind of stuff. I notice it when Christmas comes, especially when I'm kind of called on to come up with some new thing around Christmas, a new way to look at it. The bah humbug thing is that I find myself more and more resistant to even at times resentful of certainly unmoved by idyllic and serene scenes of Jesus' birth that first Christmas morn that make his birth that first Christmas morn look, well, idyllic and serene. I don't like those pictures because way down deep in my core, I don't think it looked idyllic or serene. A couple of years ago, you might remember, if you were here, I think you do, that we looked at the Christmas story because I'm always kind of looking at things from a different angle and the scriptures help us do that. You don't have to be having an imagination, just kind of look at the scriptures. We looked at the Christmas story a couple years ago through the lens of John's Revelation, which gave to us a behind the scenes look at what was really going on that first Christmas morn where on one hand we have these, again, idyllic scenes with snowfall and sleighs and nativity scenes, you know, isn't that cute, that kind of stuff. But it turns out that what was really going on that Christmas morning was a war going on in heaven as God was setting into motion his plan to win back the hearts of men and women, to redeem his lost creation. But this thing wasn't going to happen without a fight of cosmic proportions. Revelation 12 verse 1, you might remember, describes Christmas morning this way, that a great sign appeared in heaven. A woman clothed with the sun and moon under her feet and on her head a crown of 12 stars. And she was with child and she cried out, being in labor and in pain to give birth. Verse five, and she gave birth to a son. This is Christmas here. A male child who is to rule and redeem and restore the nations. Now, many of you know, as we've done some teaching in the past on Revelation, the book of the Revelation, When you're dealing with the book of Revelation, you're dealing with apocalyptic language. And that's just a fancy way to say symbolic language. Some of which is obvious, this symbolism. The male child in those verses I just read, born to the woman who would rule and redeem the nations is obviously Christ. The woman who is giving birth in the broadest sense is actually Israel. When it talks about 12 stars, it's the 12 tribes of Judah. And so symbolically, this woman is Israel because the Messiah was going to come from Israel. But more specifically, as the story fleshes itself out in reality, it's Mary who is this woman. Revelation 12, verse 3, the story picks up. It says this, then another sign appeared in heaven on Christmas Day. And behold, a great dragon appeared. Obviously, the symbolism would be Satan. Having seven hens and ten horns and on his head were seven diadems. In the middle of verse 4, it says that the dragon there stood before the woman who was about to give birth so that when she gave birth, he might devour the child. First six words of verse 7 say then this, and there was a war in heaven, which makes me wonder, whatever happened to Silent Night? One of my favorite Christmas hymns is, the first line goes, like this little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie. Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by. And that's my picture of Christmas, a dreamless sleep, meaning an undisturbed sleep. How peaceful, how, it's just, that's just Christmas. Yet in the dark streets shineth the everlasting light, the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight. Now when I read that verse, that song, it's the last line of that verse that I'm drawn to. That's the one that gets my attention. Actually, just two words in that last line, hopes and fears. My question, and this is the bahumbug in me again, thinking it really wasn't serene or idyllic. or idyllic, the two words are these, hopes and fears. And my question is, what were they? In Jesus' day, that first Christmas morn, what were people afraid of? What were they hoping for? What were their hopes and fears? In other words, and this is kind of the question that's driving my talk this morning, what was the world like when Jesus was born? Idyllic? Serene? What were the hopes? What were the fears? Well, to answer that question both this week and next, what I want to do is tell you the tale of two kings. Two kings who represent and embody the kingdoms of this world. Indeed, these two kings we'll talk about over the next couple of weeks. Represent and embody the best that kingdoms of this world produce, particularly as it relates to power on one hand. Absolute, in fact, God-like power that crushes people and wealth, mind-boggling wealth. We'll talk about that a little bit more next week. The kind of wealth that exploits people. I want to talk to you about two kings. Actually, a third king will be involved as well. His name is Jesus. The first king is introduced to us in the text that I ask you to turn to at the beginning of this talk. Luke chapter 2 verse 1. It says this. Now it came about in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth because Caesar Augustus ruled all the inhabited earth. So if you want to know what the world was like when Jesus was born, if you want to know what people were afraid of that first Christmas morn, The answer, at least in part, is embodied in that name, Caesar Augustus. That's what the world was like. It was like Caesar Augustus. And that's what people were afraid of in the days that Jesus was born, Caesar Augustus. The second king who we'll deal with next week is Herod. In Matthew's Gospel, the second chapter, the first verse, we're told that Jesus was born in the days of Herod the king. And I'll explain how those two people could be ruling in the world at the same time a little bit more next week. But if you want to know what the world was like when Jesus was born, what people were afraid of that first Christmas morn, to answer that question, you really don't need to know much more than this, that Jesus was born in the days of Herod the king. Because that tells you what the world was like when Jesus was born. That tells you what people were afraid of that first Christmas morn. But to understand why, the answer to this question is Caesar Augustus. That's what they were afraid of. Herod the king. That's what the world was like. To understand why that's the answer, I need to give you some history. Actually, quite a lot. And if you like that kind of thing, you're going to like the sermon. If you don't like that kind of thing, this would be a really good time to take a nap. let's begin with this understanding that when Jesus was born the entire world was ruled by the Roman Empire the Roman Empire was the kingdom of this world and of all the kingdoms of this world that have ever been none have been bigger, brighter, better, grander or wealthier than Rome and like all kingdoms of this world they established themselves the way kingdoms of this world do with sheer power and overwhelming force. That's how all kingdoms of this world do it. The kingdoms of this world today do it with force and power. Rome just did it better. In fact, before Rome there was nothing like it. Some would argue that since Rome there's been nothing like this kind of power. Kingdom of Israel. Let me give you some examples. Let me give you some snapshots of the way they dominated the world with what I would call power over domination. Diodorus Seleucus, a Roman historian, said this. Quite frankly, their goal was to possess the entire world. They made the boundaries of the empire equal to the boundaries of the earth so that everything they did was designed to increase their reach and their wealth. They did it because they could with force. some of you might remember I don't know if it was two years ago I was doing a vision talk and I talked about this concept of kingdom or power over and power under and that the kingdoms of this world the kingdoms we live in do get what they get by having power over we're bigger, we're stronger we have more money, we have more votes we have power over and we dominate that way the kingdom of this world the kingdom of God is an entirely different dynamic it is the kingdom that comes under by giving your life away, not taking someone else's. Rome did what they did with force. One of the greatest generals in Roman history was a man named Germanicus. He was considered to be among the greatest because he, among other things, slaughtered the entire population across the Rhine. For 50 miles around, he wasted the country with sword and flame, neither age nor gender-inspired pity. Only the destruction of the race would end the war. Cephas, Jewish historian, records that when the Roman general Titus conquered Judea, they captured 500 or more people every day and would amuse themselves by nailing their prisoners to crosses in different positions. So great was their number that space could not be found for the crosses nor crosses for the bodies. The Roman historian Peluvius said that viewing a city destroyed by the Roman Empire with human and animal corpses everywhere led him to believe that they do this for the sake of terror. Oh, little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie and I like the snow and the sleigh and a little shawl. This was the world into which Jesus was born. Just a few years after Jesus' death and resurrection, a Roman general named Cassius conquered and enslaved 30,000 people in a city called Magdala. Magdala, Magdala. Remember Mary. Mary from Magdalene. Mary the Magdalene. Just a few years after Jesus' death and resurrection, 30,000 people enslaved in the city of Magdala. And we don't have any record of it, but I wonder where she was when Cassius enslaved those people. in 4 AD for the year 4 after death Jesus' death there was a revolt in a city called Sepphoris a city I've taught on before we're going to make mention of it a little bit next week as well Sepphoris is a city three and a half miles from Nazareth where Jesus grew up it was a city set on a hill because it was set on a hill which made it visible quite visible actually from Nazareth the Roman general Varus burned it to the ground in 4 AD primarily because several years previous to that, in another revolt among the Jews trying to overpower the Roman Empire, Varus had let the people in Sepphoris off easy by hunting, by simply, instead of burning the whole city to the ground, this time he simply hunted down and crucified 2,000 men that he thought were part of the revolt. And the historians that I was reading anyway indicated that in all likelihood Jesus was probably a teenager in Nazareth. The likelihood of him knowing of that is very high. The possibility that he saw that is very high as well, which means, among other things, it's a very interesting thing when you think of Jesus going to the cross and taking on that faith. It was something that he had known about. It was something that he had seen. The point is this, that these are all places and events, real places and real events that had interaction with and an effect upon Jesus and his disciples. And all of these real life events help us to answer the question, what was the world like when Jesus was born? And what were people afraid of? Their hopes and fears. What were people afraid of that first Christmas morn? So Rome ruled the world. Who ruled Rome? answers to that question Rome was ruled by a series of Caesars say that ten times fast first Caesar and maybe the best known to us is Julius Caesar but that's only because of his relationship with Mark Anthony and Elizabeth Taylor and the fact that he invented a really good salad yeah last night they groaned at that and I think you're a much better church group wow okay I got tied up in here the fact is Julius Caesar didn't unify things he was a powerful leader but he didn't really unify Rome he was still working with the parliament and the senate that unity, the empire thing didn't really happen until 27 BC when his adopted son Octavian came to power Or Octavian changed his name to Augustus. Augustus, now we're up to speed in terms of the text we were in. It was Caesar Augustus who was able to bring the entire Roman Empire under his rule. Now he had the parliament and he had the senate, but they were very minuscule in terms of their power. The entire Roman Empire under his rule. And when this happened, you need to know this was a monumental moment in human history. the entire world had become united under one ruler. Think of this. One ruler, one king, one kingdom. And one of the songs, as it were, that would have been sung in those days was this. One king, one kingdom, and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Hallelujah, hallelujah. And for a while, and certainly for anyone who lived at the time of Jesus or at the time of Caesar Augustus that looked to be true that this kingdom would be forever. It was far-reaching. It was powerful. Nobody was able to stand against it. Even after Augustus died, he was followed by more Caesars, which indicated that this would go on forever and ever because after Augustus, there came Tiberius and then Caligula, Nero, Vespasian, Domitian, and Titus, but none were quite like Augustus. His was the golden age. In fact, it was called just that, the golden age of Rome under Caesar Augustus. He ruled from what we know now to be Britain all the way to India. And the parliament ultimately came to declare him as his power and stature grew. He is bigger than a man. They declared him to be God incarnate on earth. Caesar Augustus, God in flesh. And they did that at least in part because of something that happened in 17 B.C. A star was shown in the heavens. It was a shooting star. And the story about that star began to spread. The shooting star was Julius Caesar, the father of Augustus, ascending to heaven. Augustus really liked that story. And decided that if my dad is God, I must be the son of God. Coins were minted with Julius and his star with this inscription, Augustus, the son of God. Indeed, Augustus announced that his hour had come, as if it had been prophesied. His hour had come. That was the phrase that was used. And he did this by inaugurating, get this, a 12-day celebration of his birth called the 12 days of Advent. Oh, oh, that's weird. I thought that was ours. that's right the 12 days of advent and they they wore red and green sweaters with snowmen on them and they drank eggnog spiked with rum really good eggnog actually it's true not the sweaters 12 day celebration of Augustus birth called the 12 days of advent because his birth in his mind and in the mind I mean who could argue with this was the turning point in history. That's what people thought in Luke chapter 2, verse 1. I mean, dial back into Luke 2, verse 1 with a little bit of this history we've got. In Luke 2, verse 1, now, not when it was written, when Luke 2 was written by Luke, it was written after the life of Jesus, after the pronouncements of a different kind of kingdom, after the death and resurrection of Jesus, the ascension of Jesus, after Pentecost and the power of the Spirit for him, this was written then. But when in history Luke chapter two verse one happened, when historically Caesar sent out a decree that a census would be taken, ask yourself this question. Again, just get into the story. Enter it as best you can. Who in Luke chapter two verse one is the big story? Whose kingdom is the big kingdom? Who's the big king? So obviously Caesar is the big story. and if there's another king or another kingdom we haven't seen him yet temples were built in his honor prayers and sacrifices were offered to the god Augustus songs were written praise songs choruses calling him the savior of peace who has brought a golden age to the world and one of the lines would go like this may it last with increasing splendor from age to age, both now and forever, and ever, and ever. The poet Virgil. By the way, you can get this in the, this is library stuff here. You can get on the internet. Google Poet Virgil. This stuff will all come up. The poet Virgil evidently was a real fan of Augustus Caesar's. He made all sorts of pronouncements and even predictions about him. Here are a few. I'm quoting the poet Virgil here. He, that is Augustus, is the divine king of salvation from whom all mankind has waited. He will annihilate the evil of the past and free the people from increasing fear. Wow, he's a good guy. He will establish a universal empire of peace. Really? That's wonderful. And will lead in the golden age for the blessing of a renewed humanity. Renewed humanity, that kind of sounds like a good thing. Renewed humanity, that sounds like like something God would do. Well, Augustus is God. The problem is, little thing Virgil left out about the renewed humanity, the way you got a renewed humanity was a genocide of anybody who was human that you didn't like. The little thing that Virgil left out was the way that Augustus was going to bring in this empire of peace was by conquering and killing anyone who disagreed with him. And when everyone who disagreed with him was dead, peace, finally. Shut up. tell him okay now we have peace and unity everybody agrees isn't this wonderful it's the golden age popular phrase of the day became Caesar is Lord and a lot of people said it because they believed it and a lot of people said it because if you didn't say it they'd have peace one way or the other indeed in certain parts of the Roman Empire and this was a tough sell in Judea and Israel because they had this strange belief about a different kind of God and that was where the tension was the most intense but there were parts of the Roman Empire where you couldn't buy or sell unless you said Caesar is Lord in fact Domitian one of the Caesars after Augustus came up with a thing that if you were going to buy and sell and do trade and by this meant whether you could make a living or not and buy food. You had to take a mark on your wrist. And the Jews so hated that in terms of its idolatry and the recognition of another god that they called Domitian a beast. And anyone who would take that mark would be taking the mark of the beast. And people today are wondering who it is right there. Popular propaganda slogan in those days was this related to Caesar. Salvation is to be found in no one other than Augustus. Listen to this. for there was no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved, they said. But what they meant by saved was allowed to live. By the way, that phrase, you know, when you hear that phrase, some of you know where that phrase comes from as far as what we know, but it doesn't come from originally what we know. Acts 4.12, Peter said, there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. Neither is there salvation in any other. But now when I give you this history, what's incredible to me about Peter saying that is that in Acts 4.12, the Caesars are still in power. Augustus is dead by now, but the Caesars are still in power. In Acts 4.12, Peter is on trial. Read the story. He's on trial for his life. Peter who one day would be crucified upside down because the Romans enjoyed crucifying people in different positions. But when he said, neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved, he wasn't spouting theology. Although it was theology, that's not what he was doing. He wasn't like a preacher preaching, you need to know this. And it was like he was full of vinegar. He was, that was a statement of defiance. I can't imagine him saying that without his lips quivering his knees shaking and a declaration in the face of the God of this world the kingdom of this world saying I disagree with you there is Jesus is the name Jesus is the king this kingdom looks huge I have seen a different king and I have seen a different kingdom and I am living in a bigger story than this one but you need to know this what he was confronting looked huge and crushed everyone here's how it worked Augustus army would go into a village and say Caesar is Lord if you accepted that you were saved by his power divine and you became a center of Caesar worship If you didn't accept that Caesar was Lord, you were either enslaved or slaughtered. Now, to pull all this off, Augustus needed a massive army. To fund the army, he needed money. To get the money, he raised taxes, mostly from the people he conquered, leaving them in abject poverty. Now, I don't know how to paint the picture accurately enough for you. I'll probably get into this a little bit more next week. But you need to know that that was the world that Jesus came into, a world of despair and poverty, where very, very few had enormous amounts of wealth and enormous amounts of people had almost nothing. Most estimate that the Jews in Jesus' time were, in Jesus' town, rather, were taxed in the neighborhood of 80 to 90%. I mean, it was the Herod tax, you had the temple tax, the Augustus tax. Imagine being a Jew in Jesus' day, being taxed more and more and more, primarily so Rome can rule the world. People lost their family land. Now, dial into this. In Judea, in particular, Jews constantly, it was part of their heritage to trace their lineage back to Abraham. Paul, actually, remember that in Philippians, I think Philippians 3, he traces lineage all the way back to Abraham. And this was the promised land. And people had land. It was an agricultural community. And most of Jesus' parables were about agriculture. And so people worked the land and they owned this land. But in Jesus' day, people who had had land for generations had lost their land because they couldn't afford to keep where they lived because of taxes. It was very interesting when I uncovered some of this history. Some speculate, and we don't know this for sure, but they speculate about Joseph, who was from Bethlehem. He was living in Nazareth, and when the census came, he had to go back to Bethlehem. But he was living in Nazareth, and some of the speculation is the reason he was living in Nazareth at the time was because that's where he could get some work, and he had lost the family land. This was the world. This was the world. The point of all this is this. If you're going to understand the Christmas story, you need to understand that the Christmas story was birthed in the context of incredible poverty and despair. The reason is because Caesar had brought peace. Really? By the way, that even puts another spin on some things that Jesus has said. Now that you know this, when you hear Jesus say things like this, peace I leave with you. My peace, by the way, I give unto you. Not as the world gives peace, give I unto you. See, that means something to us. That would have meant an entirely different thing. Oh, I know how the world gives peace. They crush you if you don't agree. Not as the world gives. Is he for real? One more thing to stir in the pot. These people, particularly these people in Judea where the story happened among the Jews, they believed that they were God's people. Indeed, that they were God's chosen people. So mixed into the pot for them relative to this story are some very disturbing and bitter questions. Primarily this question, where are you, God? We do not believe that Caesar is God. Some of us, to save our lives, muttered under our breaths. But we do not believe that Caesar is God. But in the midst of all of this stuff, we have a question, God, how long? Are people like Caesar going to get away with this kind of thing? How long became the cry of the people in Jesus' day? Luke chapter 2 verse 25 says that there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon who was righteous and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel. The operative word in that verse is waiting. You see, to understand the Christmas story and to enter into it and not just drive by another nativity scene sometime this afternoon and go, oh, there's a cute one. To enter into the Christmas story is to enter into the tension of a whole nation of people who are waiting and who are wondering, how long, God? How long will people get stepped on? And how long will the people who do the stepping get away with it? How long will Caesar rule? And how long will Herod win? And it's not just Caesar and it's not just Herod. That question continues because there are Caesars and there are Herods who rise up in the kingdoms of this world. Now this is where the Christmas story picks up, enters in, Because right in the middle of this abject despair, out of nowhere, literally out of nowhere, comes the story of an angel who appears to a young Jewish peasant girl. And I mean young. Girls were offered in marriage at 13 and 14 years. Whoa. Who? Hmm. Junior high girl. And the angel says to her in Luke 1, verse 30, Mary, don't be afraid. For you have found favor with God. You're going to give birth to a child and he will be great in a different way than Caesar is great and he will bring a kingdom but it's going to be a different kind of kingdom than the ones you have seen and he will be called the son of the most high God and the Lord God will give to him a different kind of throne. He will give to him the throne of his father David and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom, of his kingdom, there shall be no and Mary. Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, you're gonna have a baby. And that baby is a king, which means among other things, Mary, Caesar's going down. Herod, clock's ticking. Buzz started with a baby. Here's the picture. It's the Christmas picture. I don't know how to put this on a card. But it's a picture of a huge monolithic oppressor who looks like they never lose. But in a dark, tiny, almost forgotten corner of Caesar's massive empire, among a tiny minority group of irrelevant to Caesar ethnicity, a baby is about to be born to a 14-year-old Jewish peasant girl named Mary who has already begun to sing a song that Caesar hasn't heard. And the song is found in Luke 1, verse 47. It's called the Magnificat. It begins with these words, Mary singing, My soul exalts the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God, my Savior. God is my Savior, she says. Caesar is Lord. Caesar is Lord. I don't think so. I don't think so. Indeed, you need to know that in the early days of this Jesus movement, followers of Jesus used that phrase as an act of defiance. Jesus is Lord. See, for us, it's a bumper sticker. In those days, if you said anyone but Caesar was Lord, you would probably be crucified upside down. They began not just to whisper it, but to sing it. I don't think so. I don't think Caesar is Lord. Jesus is Lord. Jesus is Lord. for their salvation in no other name. No other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. Those were declarations of defiance for I have seen the risen one and I have seen a different king and I have seen a different kingdom and I have seen a bigger story. You need to get something as I read the rest of the Magnificat here in Luke chapter one that Mary is feisty. These words I'm about to read are not the words of some timid, scared little girl. They are fierce and filled with force. Thomas Cahill, a historian, calls the Magnificat the most muscular poem in all of ancient literature. This is, he says, a larger than life song of triumph. Thanking God for righting all wrongs and making a definitive statement in favor for all time. In favor of the powerless over the powerful. No one knows it yet, but Mary knows it. And what no one knows yet is this, the poor, the hungry, and the humiliated win. Verse 48, for he has regard, he has had regard for the humble state of his bond slave. And now that you know a little bit about the poverty Mary lived in, you know a little bit more about the humble state that she did indeed feel for. Behold, from this time on, all generations will count me blessed. for the mighty one has done great things for me, and holy is his name, and his mercy is upon generation after generation. Mary was a Jew, and she had heard the stories, and she knew of her fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and words that came to Abraham and Moses when God said in various times of human history, I have seen the oppression of my people, and I have come down. It's happening again. in a bigger and grander and smaller way. And his mercy is upon generation after generation toward those who fear him. He has done mighty deeds with his arm. He has scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their heart. He has brought down rulers from their throne and exalted those who are humble. He has filled the hungry with good things and sent away the rich empty-handed. when she talks about rulers coming down. She's going, I got me a baby. I got me a baby in my womb who is a king and of his kingdom there shall be no end. And whatever else that means, it means this. Caesar's going down. Herod clock's ticking. Questions for take home. I'm not gonna answer these questions. These are just some questions I want you to think about as it relates to the Christmas story. how is the Christmas story a story about religion well that's kind of obvious how is the Christmas story a story about salvation we probably know the answer to that question let me press it further how is the Christmas story a story about justice how is the Christmas story a story about economics it even makes me wonder we're going to do Christmas How is the Christmas story, if you get back to the original story, the abject poverty, what kingdom are you living in now? Where are you in the story? I think that's kind of a disturbing question for me. Are you kind of with Mary? Abject poverty? I don't even think we have a clue what that had to feel like. Or are we more like Caesar? Whoa, don't even want to think about that. Well, then don't think about that. Whatever you do. Two kings, two kingdoms. One kingdom built on crushing, enslaving, oppressing. One kingdom built on accumulating more and more and more. What would that be? One kingdom built on manipulating and using and wounding, even killing people who get in its way. Another kingdom, an entirely different kingdom, is sometimes hard to spot because it's so often the way it happens, starts really small, like a baby, like a mustard seed. But this kingdom is built on an entirely different foundation. It's built not on taking and accumulating, but on giving, and not on destroying, but on building, and lifting and liberating and healing and forgiving and freeing. In Luke chapter 4, when Jesus announced his ministry, it's a verse that we're familiar with. I've used it often. You hear it with a slightly different spin when you hear the history. Jesus in Luke 4 says this. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the who? To the poor. Where were they in Jesus' day? Everywhere. Everywhere. And he's anointed me to preach, release to captives, recovery of sight to the blind, to set free the downtrodden. The Christmas story is a story of religion. It's a story of salvation. It's a story of justice. It's a story of economics. And all of what Jesus came to do is established, not by taking life, which is what Augustus did, and the kingdoms of this world do, but by giving life, particularly his own. life. We're talking about a different kind of king. It's a different kind of kingdom. Which one do you serve? Which one do you serve? Really? Let me give you a historic footnote to close this morning. Here it is. Julius Caesar, dead. Augustus Caesar died. Tiberius died. Caligula died. Nero died. Vespasian died. Domitian died. Titus died. That's why one of the life-giving and hope-producing phrases that was often on the lips of the early followers of Christ was this. Jesus lives. In fact, that little run I did about Vespasian dead sounded like I was being glib. Actually, I stole that from Peter. First sermon ever preached. At Pentecost, Jesus is risen. Many had seen him. They were all staking their life on it and willing to die for it because Peter, among others, had seen the risen Christ. By this time, the Spirit had come at Pentecost and Peter stood to explain what had happened and here's what he said. Men of Israel, listen to these words. Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with signs and wonders which God performed before you in your midst that you had seen was nailed to a cross by evil men, but God has raised him up again, putting an end to the agony of his death since it was impossible for death to hold him. And then Peter goes into this thing about David, the patriarch, and basically what he says, David, the patriarch, we all adore him. David, dead. And he wasn't dishonoring David. But in verse 29, brethren, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch, David, that he both died and was buried. David, dead. This Jesus, however, God raised up again, to which we are all witnesses. Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God in heaven, we see from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit. He has poured forth this, which you both see and hear. Therefore, verse 36, let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus who was crucified, for he is risen. And I am inviting you now into a whole different kingdom with a whole different king. Your dude died. His dad died. His son died. Die, die, die. Your dude dead. Our dude lives. So Merry Christmas, everybody. Next week, Herod. And I'll tell you this much this week about Herod. If Caesar Augustus, who we talked about today, is the historic symbol and embodiment of people and systems who use power to conquer and crush, Herod is the historic symbol and embodiment of people and systems who use wealth to exploit. And God's kingdom is opposed to and will destroy both. Which tells us just a little something of what we should be involved in and moving toward and living in as well. Let's stand as we close. the kingdoms of this world father we do confess look big and we at times get sucked in by their grandeur and the things they offer and in ways that we don't even know we do declare sometimes the Caesars to be Lord we declare it by how we live and how we think and what we give ourselves to. That's why we need to hear this Christmas story because it interrupts us and it forces us in a way to not just remember but decide which king, which kingdom, who am I, where do I fit, what story am I living in? That is a question that can haunt us. It's also a question that can liberate us and invite us. into the big story of the kingdom of God. For of his rule, there shall be no end. And that is why we say with joy, Jesus is Lord. Say it with me one time. Jesus is Lord. All God's people said, Amen.
