As we come today to chapter 25, I want you to be aware of the fact that even though it is a new chapter, we are still dealing with the Olivet Discourse, where Jesus is revealing to the disciples, and therefore also now to us, the events that are related to His second coming. I think we're aware of the fact, because of our study over the last several weeks, that this discourse was precipitated by a question that the disciples asked of Jesus back in verse 3 of chapter 24, And the question basically had two parts. The first part of the question was, Jesus, what will be the sign of your coming? And Jesus began to answer that question in verses 4 to 31. The second part of their question was, Jesus, when will these things happen that you spoke of as being the signs of your coming? And Jesus dealt with that part of the question in verses 32 to 42. And the primary answer to the disciples' question as to when these things will happen was basically this, nobody knows. In verse 36 of chapter 24, of that day and of that hour, nobody knows. Not the angels of heaven nor the Son, but the Father alone. He went on to reiterate that same thing of no one knowing for sure when he's coming in verse 42. Also verse 44 and verse 50. Therefore, or because of the fact that we do not know the final day, and because of the fact that you do not know your final day and I do not know my final day, because of that, a warning came. from verses 42 to 51. And the warning we dealt with two weeks ago was basically threefold. Because we do not know, be on the alert, be ready, and finally be faithful. Today with the parable in verses 1 to 13 of chapter 25 of the ten virgins, it is as if Jesus is restating the vital nature of these warnings we dealt with two weeks ago by revealing what we are going to call this morning the danger of superficial preparation for the coming of the king. The danger of superficial preparation for the coming of the king. Let's read the text, verse 1. Then, when is then? In the final day, or in your final day, the kingdom of heaven will be comparable to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. And five of them were foolish and five were prudent. For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them. But the prudent, or wise, took oil in flasks along with their lamps. Now, while the bridegroom was delaying, they all got drowsy and began to sleep. But at midnight there was a shout, Behold the bridegroom, come out and meet him. Then all of those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us some of your oil for our lamps are going out. but the prudent answered saying no there there will not be enough for us and you too go instead to the dealers and buy some for yourselves and while they were going away to make the purchase the bridegroom came and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast and the door was shut and later the other virgins also came saying lord lord open up for us but he answered and said And truly I say to you, I do not know you. Be on the alert, therefore. For you do not know the day nor the hour. Let's pray as we begin. Lord, in light of the fact that these are among the final words that you said on earth to your disciples, just that fact brings urgency to this. But, Father, as we read this parable, there is also a sense of urgency just in the reading of it. There are people who are going to come according to this text saying, Lord, Lord, thinking they know you, but you don't know them. And, Father, I pray in Jesus' name that your spirit would bring alive this text so that those who need to hear this word of warning would indeed. I want to also ask Jesus, even at the beginning, that those who would possibly be hooked, maybe even by the twisting of the enemy, using this truth would generate in them some sort of fear that they somehow don't belong to you. I'm talking about those who genuinely do belong to you. I pray for protection among the truly redeemed, that there would be an ability to rest in this text. But Father, a word of powerful warning to those who are not among the redeemed. We pray that you would do the sorting out and that you would anoint this time in Jesus' name. Amen. It is very hot up here and I'm losing this. I suppose that it goes without saying that at the first coming of Christ, the world was not ready for his coming. It wasn't because they didn't know he was coming. They did know. The prophets and the scriptures spoke over and over again revealing the fact that the Messiah would come and when he did, he would be born in Bethlehem. Not only would he be born in Bethlehem, but he would be born a virgin and he was both born in Bethlehem and born of a virgin. He would come in the line of David, and he did come in the line of David. When his words and his work of ministry began, the Word of God prophesied that his words and his works would be attended with signs and wonders. And when his ministry began, his words and work were attended with signs and wonders. Yet, when he did indeed come unto his own, the fact is this, that his own received him not, they were not prepared. Simply put, this parable we're dealing with this morning is a warning to the world to not let that dynamic happen again. And the full force of this warning, I believe, is captured by understanding three aspects or elements of this particular parable. The first element to understand is the wedding itself. What is the thing that is happening there? And there are some things that we need to understand about that. The second thing that's helpful to understand here is the condition of the bridesmaids. It says that some are foolish and some are wise. What made them wise and what made them foolish? And the third thing is the coming of the groom. Let's look first of all at the nature of the wedding. Like all of Jesus' parables, they are drawn from life situations that are common to the original hearers. A wedding would be no exception to that particular rule. But weddings for them in this particular culture, though they were celebrations as they are for us, were a different sort of celebration. The way they did their marriages were different than the way we do ours. While there are similarities, there were some significant differences. Therefore, we need to teach in order to kind of get into the metaphor that Jesus is giving at this time. A Jewish marriage at the time of Christ would have basically involved three elements. The first element of a marriage would have involved the engagement. We're pretty familiar with that. Most of us, when we get married, first of all, get engaged. Their engagements, however, were different than ours. Engagement would have taken place, by the way, quite a bit before the events of Chapter 25. The engagement was an official contract. It was an official contract drawn up between the two parents on behalf of the couple. Now, before you groan and mutter all sorts of things about how disgusting that is, generally this agreement, again, drawn up between the parents, was done with the couple's consent, sometimes at the couple's request. But the legality of this union, the agreement, was worked out and ratified by the parents. A short time after the engagement, there came the period of the betrothal. Now, the betrothal was marked by an official ceremony with public vows. This was the place where you would invite your friends and you would invite your family. In our minds, if you're trying to get a visual picture, it would be what we see visually at a wedding. This is the place where legally we become married. At this point, we belong to each other. However, at this particular ceremony that introduced the time of betrothal, the couple did not begin their married life together. The relationship was not consummated physically at this point. They did not go and begin to live together at this point. If you want to get a picture of this, this is where Mary and Joseph were on their way to Bethlehem. They were betrothed one to another. Legally, they belonged to each other, but they had not yet begun married life together. They were committed. Betrothal is a time at which you belong to each other. To break a betrothal would require a divorce, but again, married life has not taken place as is normal. The purpose of a betrothal in this culture was significant. By the way, it lasted up to a year, and that year was used to give the young man specifically time to prepare for the coming of his bride, or the time when he would literally go to his bride. He would use that time to prepare a place. He would use that time to prepare a life for his bride. Sometimes that preparation meant he would spend that year building an addition to his father's house where he and his wife would live. Sometimes it meant building a separate house where he and his wife would live. Sometimes it simply meant a time where he would prove to all of the people involved that he could and would provide for his wife and care for her. Imagine, if you will, that this couple was indeed a couple that requested the parents make this arrangement. They really did love each other. They were goo-goo about each other, and it was a wonderful thing. But now here we are. We've had our betrothal. We've had our vows. We've made our promises. We belong to each other. And now we kind of separate in some sense. Even though we know we're bound, the relationship is secure, this could be a very frustrating time. The relationship is secure. It's a done deal. We love each other. But it's not a particularly easy time. But one of the things that keeps you going during this whole betrothal time, as he might get lonely, as she might get lonely, is this. I know that at the end of all of this preparation time, it will be worth it all. And so all during this betrothal period, there was a constant looking forward to and anticipation of the culmination, the consummation when we come together and have this beginning of our life together. I don't know if you've picked it up yet, but the spiritual application of this wedding betrothal phase is very much a picture of our relationship with Jesus Christ right now. Whether we've connected with it or not, we are living in the phase of our marriage to Jesus that we would call the betrothal. Right now as I stand before you and you sit there, we belong to him. We have legally been wed to him if we are among the redeemed. Our relationship is secure. We belong to each other. And we live in this period of time where we anticipate the beginning of what I would call now, in light of this passage, our real life together. Now, I'm living with Christ right now by the Spirit in me, but there's going to come a time when I see him how? Face to face. That's the culmination. That's the consummation. Very much like a bride would be waiting for the groom is where we are right now. I'll be moving past the promise into the reality. We'll be moving past what is a somewhat distanced relationship right now to a time where we see face to face. And that'll be glory. My little boy Caleb came up to me this week. We were playing ball or something. And I don't know about your kids, but my kids bring up questions out of the blue. You know, it's not like we were sitting on the couch talking about spiritual things. And, you know, that's when I'm ready. And we were playing baseball. And he walks up to me with this kind of confused look on his face. And he goes, you know, Dad, sometimes it's hard to believe in Jesus because I don't ever see him. okay good okay and i sat down with him and i said you know i struggle with that too i do and and uh the bible talks about even though we don't see we believe and and there's glory in that and uh but that's a tough thing so we talked about that but later on as i was even reflecting on this period of betrothal where the groom is gone and we live in anticipation of the of the coming of the groom sometimes we don't see him either we start wondering and that is why beloved ephesians chapter 1 says to us, I want you to know that I have given to you the seal of the Spirit as a pledge. Remember that verse? I have given to you the seal of the Spirit as a pledge. And the word pledge there is Aribon. And what Aribon simply means is the engagement ring of the Spirit. I have received the Spirit. Everyone who is redeemed in this room has got the resident Spirit within him that has regenerated them, that is empowering them to live. And every time you connect with the reality of the Spirit of God in you, that is a pledge, that is a reminder that you have got the engagement ring of God. I am the betrothed of God. You belong to Him. I belong to Him. The harabon of the Spirit proves it every time I notice it. We are the betrothed of Christ. That is the period within which we live right now. Getting back to the picture here of betrothal in the wedding, in the marriage, I think it's safe to assume that this betrothal period would have affected how they lived. The groom would live in light of the fact that he has betrothed to his bride. He would live with a single-minded commitment to prepare for his bride. If you want to get a picture of that as it relates to the redeemed, think about John 14 for a second. This is wonderful. Let not your heart be troubled, Jesus says. Believe in God. Believe also in me. Here's my promise to you, my bride. In my Father's house are many dwelling places. If it were not so, I would have told you. For I go to prepare a place for you, my bride. And if I go and prepare a place for you, here's my promise. I will come again for my bride. And I will receive you unto myself that where I am, there you may be also forever and ever and ever. And that's when we're going to begin the married life. Even though we're betrothed now, one day face to face. Have you ever prepared something for somebody that you really love? I mean really prepared. I don't mean like when I get a gift for my wife or something. This is terrible. But like the day before it's her birthday, I go out to Dayton's, I look for something on sale, and I find something. The colors match. Okay, great. I'm talking about something that you're really prepared. I hope you've all had an experience like that from time to time where you really thought it out, and maybe you made something. And the whole time you're making it, you begin to delight in it. And the more you think about it and the thing starts coming to shape and you know it's an expression of your love, one of the things that emanates from you is this. Wait until she sees this. Wait. And you want to get people. Come here, look at this one I got for her. It's so incredible. Isn't that wonderful? And it really is good. It wasn't something I made, you know. Maybe some of you can make nice things. And it would be great. I think we would do very well to get a picture of Jesus, our groom, doing exactly that. Somewhere in the heavenlies, he is preparing a place for us even now. his bride, his betrothed, and his commitment is to do just that. And what I think he's saying in his spirit, among other things, is just wait till they see this. It is exceeding abundantly beyond everything my bride could ask or think. It's beyond everything they even know they need. And the bride is affected too by this betrothal time, living with a single-minded commitment to the preparation for the coming of the groom, and that issues, beloved, in purity, and it issues in devotion, and it issues in a chastity of sorts, knowing that there will be a culmination with my groom, and waiting for that culmination is worth letting anything else pass by. Nothing here is worth what I'm going to have one day, and so I live in light of that. It's called sanctification, living separated unto God because I'm his betrothed. At the end of that period of betrothal comes the groom. And this is the culmination. And again, in the dynamic of the wedding, the parable Jesus is referring to in the spiritual sense, this is a reference to the coming of the king, the second coming of Christ. And this is where our text begins to intersect. At the end of the betrothal, at the coming of the groom, there is no ceremony, only celebration. The groom comes with his attendants. He gathers his bride and her attendants. They parade through the streets with the torches lit. Generally, the wedding begins sometime in the evening so it's dark. And they parade through the streets singing and dancing. Wonderful party, incredible celebration. They then return to the house for the wedding feast. And that wedding feast lasts generally up to seven days. And that is, by the way, a picture of the marriage supper of the Lamb when our bride, our groom, comes for us, his bride, and we have an incredible celebration. at the end of that feast according to Jewish custom the friend of the groom who would be the equivalent of the best man would take the hand of the bride place it in the hand of the groom and everyone would leave hopefully with that background set of what the wedding is like let's consider now point number two the condition of the bridesmaids then the kingdom of heaven will be comparable not to a wedding but specifically to this aspect of the wedding that I want you to get to ten virgins who took their lamps. Stop right there. I want us to look at these elements here of verse 1. Ten virgins who took their lamps. First of all, the virgins. The word there simply means maiden or unmarried girl. The fact that they are referred to as virgins, in my opinion, is not speaking to their morality or their character. The reason I think that is because verse 2 is going to speak to their character. He's going to say some of them were wise and some of them were foolish. So the virgin concept doesn't have a big spiritual significance. I believe that all it means is that it is something fitting the pattern of weddings in that culture that they would be virgins or maidens. The fact that there were ten, however, I do believe has some significance. In the mind of the Jew, biblically, the number ten had significance. There were ten commandments. There were ten families that were needed to make up a synagogue. There were ten people who were needed to eat the Paschal Supper. There were ten talents referred to in Matthew 25, verse 28. There were ten pieces of silver in Luke 15, verse 8. And here there were ten bridesmaids. What is this ten? I don't want to get lost in this, so let me just give you a thumbnail piece of this. The number ten speaks to the concept of completeness. It speaks to the concept of completeness. In other words, when there are ten commandments, everything that you could possibly need to know literally about the law of God is there. It is complete. It's all, everything that is necessary is there. Therefore, this picture of ten virgins translates in basically into this, that all of those people in all of the ages who've ever been associated with the groom, they're all there. There is a sense of completion. You following me? Everybody who's ever been associated with the Christ, in other words, the Redeemer, associated even in a loose sort of sense, they're all there and there's a sense of completion. these ten sense of completion everybody who's been associated with the groom or the Christ are there and they took their lamps literally that word is torches it is the same kind of torch that the Romans had when they came in John 18 verse 3 to arrest Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane it would have been a long pole at the top of that pole there would have been a wire mesh apparatus that wire mesh apparatus was stuffed with cloth The cloth itself was soaked in oil so that the cloth would not be burned up. On top of that, anyone who was going to use a torch knew that they had to have a flask of oil with them as well so that the torch would continue to burn. If it didn't have the oil, then the rag or the cloth itself would be consumed. Put that all together, and there's a picture developed that we need to see. The picture is this. It is a picture of people in every age who've gathered with the assembly of celebrating people who are awaiting the coming of the groom. Give that the spiritual significance. It is a picture of people in every age who've gathered with the assembly of celebrating people who are awaiting the coming of Christ. Their presence at the wedding speaks to their interest in the groom. It speaks to their interest in Christ. The fact that they have a torch speaks to the fact that there is apparent readiness to meet Jesus, to meet the groom. All of them at the wedding show outward marks of readiness. They have their dresses. They have their torches. Just the fact that they're at the wedding at all seems to speak to the fact that they belong. They're in the church. That would be the parallel to being at the wedding. They're going to church. They do it every Sunday. They carry their Bibles. Maybe that's their torch. I don't know. They sing their songs. They give a testimony. If they were asked, they could give some sort of testimony. They might even have a ministry, just like a bridesmaid would have some little duty to perform to make sure that, here's your little job, they might even have a ministry, but they are not all the same. There is a difference between them. And that's the point of the parable. What is the difference? Verse 2, five of them were foolish, five of them were wise. Question, what is it that distinguishes or differentiates the wise slave or wise virgin from the foolish? Verse 3 and 4 reveals that. For when the wise or for when the foolish took their lamps. They took no oil with them, but the prudent took the oil in flasks along with their lamps. Next question. What's the oil? A lot of varied opinions on this. I'll give you mine. My opinion is this, that the oil is simply this. It is the necessary reality of saving, sanctifying, life-transforming grace. The oil is saving grace. The oil, in my opinion, is the internal resident recreating presence of the Holy Spirit made available by grace and energized by faith. The oil, in my opinion, is imputed righteousness that comes only by faith, not by trying to crank it out and earning it yourself. The oil, in my opinion, is true redemption by his blood alone, the forgiveness of sin. And the problem that Jesus is identifying in this particular passage is this, that some people at the wedding were and And some people at the wedding are, if I were to again update it, some people in the church are, like those of whom Paul spoke in 2 Timothy 3.5, holding to a form of godliness, but they are void of power. They are void of the oil of the Spirit, the genuine life of God. But they look good. As the picture of this parable came clear to me early in the week as I was studying, I couldn't help but contrast it to the parable we had just two weeks ago, the one just before this. And if you remember the parable before this, Jesus was speaking of an evil slave. Remember the evil slave? Easy to spot because they are a consumer. This person doesn't look like that evil slave at all. It says they were eating and drinking with drunkards, verse 40. Well, this person's not doing that at all. And I don't know for sure what was in the mind of God, in the mind of Jesus or Matthew, when these two parables were up against each other, but I think that part of the dynamic of teaching is this. You remember that verse 42 to 51, Jesus is saying in light of the fact that you don't know your final day, be alert, be ready, be faithful, and be made ready by the blood of the Lamb. And then when he talked about the faithful and faithless slaves, he was saying basically this, it's not that hard for me to spot who has been made ready by the blood of the Lamb. You see, the ones who have been made ready by the blood of the Lamb are getting their life from me. And as they get their life from me, my life flows from them. And they begin to feed those in their own household. But those who are not redeemed, and they have not been made ready by the blood of the Lamb, have an entirely different life posture. Rather than giving the life God has given them, they are not doing this. They are doing this. Their whole life is absorbed and consuming things for themselves. And they are God. And that's how you can tell the redeemed from the unredeemed. but I think it's almost as if Jesus says, but wait a minute, wait a minute. See, I'm aware of something. I'm aware of the fact that some people can hear that verse and quit doing this and start doing this and just crank out the behavior and look real good and learn all of the lingo. Thus, I believe this parable. Outwardly prepared, religious, maybe even orthodox, doctrinally correct, intellectually committed, socially belonging to the church. Might go to a Christian college, might go to a good church. But this person who is called the foolish virgin is one identified by Jesus as having no light, no life, no fire, no passion. They have no oil and they have no ability to conform to the law of God. And the reason they cannot conform to the law of God is they do not have the life of God. something else about this parable that caught my eye in a troubling sense it was this five of them were foolish it doesn't say one of the ten were foolish it says five of the ten were foolish it bothered me i thought what's what's the point of the five and ten five of ten it's half i mean is this like a divine percentage where god is jesus is saying uh you know what you need to know is that in the community of everybody who kind of is hanging around a church or is a little bit religious, half of them are really redeemed and half of them are. No, I don't think that. I don't think that is what he's saying. I don't think he's trying to give us a definite percentage. In fact, there's another place that we dealt with early in Matthew that gives it a worse feeling than that if you're looking for a percentage. It says many are there who are going to go the broad road of trying to work it out themselves and cranking out their behavior to earn their salvation. Few are there who will find the narrow way of brokenness and grace. So it's not half and half there. It's just the 50% to me is not speaking of a percentage at all. It is trying to communicate this from the heart of God that this dynamic is common. This dynamic is common. Don't be surprised that there are more people than you might think that are kind of moving among the community of the redeemed. They're at the wedding feast. They sing the song. They kind of enjoy the atmosphere even. They kind of like Jesus, kind of. but they don't have the oil of the life of God. It's not isolated. When you see it, it shouldn't cause you to marvel. It is common. The wheat and tares is common. The sheep and goats dynamic is common. The reality of Ishmael and Isaac is common. Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael being born of the flesh. Isaac being born of the spirit. Genuinely redeemed. False work. Both of them, however, call God their father. So it's very confusing. It's a common thing. It's all through kingdom life. Now, with that makeup of the assembly established, what the wedding looks like and what the condition of the bridesmaids are, let's get back to the drama. In verse 5, it says that while the bridegroom was delaying, they all got drowsy and began to sleep. While the bridegroom was delaying, that is a direct reference to the fact that Jesus hasn't come yet and he is tarrying, they became drowsy and slept. The anticipation of any moment coming gave way to the reality of life living. First thing I want you to know about their dozing off is that there was nothing wrong with that. No one is chastised for dozing off. I want you to note that both the wise and the foolish virgins all went to sleep. So there's no goofy people. All it means is this, that in waiting for the coming of the king, people got on with normal life. They didn't, and by the way, this is even a bit of instruction for believers again. We're not supposed to climb up on a roof, be in our pajamas with our suitcase, waiting for them. No, no, no. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to work tomorrow. Live your life. Ironically, however, the only person on the face of the earth who can go to sleep with peace, who can go to work with freedom, who can live his life with absolute joy, wide-eyed anticipation, is the one who's got the oil. I don't care when he comes. Doesn't matter. But if you don't have the oil, don't go to sleep. Do not. Close your eyes. Because at midnight, verse 6, the voice is going to shout and that word at midnight introduces us to point number three the coming of the groom at midnight there was a shout behold the bridegroom come out and meet him again let's just look at the elements of the text in verse six at midnight that's significant it isn't exactly a normal thing to start a wedding at midnight most weddings i've been to don't start then start somewhere around seven o'clock what that's speaking of again is is in reference to the coming of Jesus. It is speaking to the fact that he is going to come in an unexpected time. The shout, behold the bridegroom, I can even tell you what that shout is going to be. It will be the voice of the archangel. It will be the trump of God. And when that happens, verse 7, all those virgins will arise and will trim their lamps, meaning simply this, to tuck in the cloth, to pour the oil, and to light the lamp. and it is at that point that those who've made a superficial preparation are going to notice. They've never noticed before. Maybe they've never heard a message like this before. But external preparation that was simply kind of religious and a good feeling about God, but no genuine life of God, when they light their torch, what's going to happen, because the life of God is not involved, it's going to burn up quickly. There was no... to it. And verse 8 says this, The foolish will notice that and say to the prudent, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the prudent answered and said, No, there will not be enough for us and you too. Go instead to the dealers and buy some for yourselves. I don't know if you've ever read this parable before, but doesn't that look selfish? I read this and I go, well, that's not very nice. You know, Sunday school teachers with kids, this is where the rubber meets the road. You know, when you're teaching kids, they have all these great questions. Because my kids, I know, would look at that passage and go, that's not, they should share. That's not sharing. So the good versions would be the ones who weren't the Christians because they didn't share. That's not the point. It's not the point that Jesus is trying to make. He's trying to make a point here, and it's one that's powerful. In fact, I think it's a hard reality, and the point is this. The oil of genuine redemption is non-transferable. Many of you, especially if you've grown up in the church, you've heard it over and over again. Maybe you never knew that there was an actual verse that said that very thing, but the oil of genuine redemption is non-transferable. What that means is this, you've got to get your own. You've got your own. And just because your parents have it, doesn't mean you have it. And you can't get it from them, you can't get it from your friends, you can't get them from me. I mean, you can't have mine. I'll tell your about it, and I'll tell you where to get it, but you can't have mine. And you can't have your parents, and you can't have this churches. You've got to get your own. And maybe these virgins, these foolish maidens at the wedding feast kind of saw the oil of the life all around. And maybe people in churches, kind of when they're in the church, they see the oil of the life of God and they see the symbols and the chalice and the Bible and all that stuff that speaks of the life of God. It's all around all the time. And maybe they thought they didn't need it applied in directly to them. Directly to them. And maybe they thought that maybe somehow since I'm in the assembly and the oil is all over the place and it's all about God, it's kind of automatically mine. It just kind of got on me some way. And maybe my parents had it. So, you know, everything that is my parents is mine and so it's mine. Strongly this week as I was thinking of this dynamic of the oil that God has given me is not transferable to anybody else, I thought of my kids. in my own family. And I went further than that, and I thought of young people in general. And I don't do this very often, but I want to talk to young people just for a minute here. I want to grab you by the heart. You know, some of you sitting in your chair right now as you listen to me are from homes where your mom and your dad are genuinely redeemed. Now, some of you haven't been, and I want to sympathize with that and grab you too. But I want to talk to the young men and women in our congregation who have moms and dads who genuinely are redeemed. They're not perfect. You know that better than anybody else. In fact, they're the biggest geeks in the whole world, okay? You know, and that's what you think. And you know, by the way, that's what you're supposed to think. So that's what they are. But you want to know something? As it relates to this dynamic of the oil of the life of God, some of you are from homes where the life of God is in your mom and dad. And I just want to gently but very firmly, as your pastor and your friend, give to you a word, and the word is this, Don't go to sleep thinking that what is theirs is automatically yours. You've got to get your own. And here's the good news. It's for free, and it's available, and there's more than you could ever know what to do with, but you've got to make it yours. You have to buy it for yourself. And by buy it, it doesn't mean earn it. It means buy it like I buy that, I believe that, I want that, I receive that. You've got to make it yours. Let me go past the kids. I think at a church our size, the potential for this kind of dynamic is very real. There is no way that I could possibly know all of you. I don't know all of you. And in many, many ways, while I sense the moving of the Spirit of God and more and more people with redeemed hearts, as I sense our worship, I sense that I'm in a community, a strong community of redeemed people. But in a church this size, in a community this size, I would be naive to believe that everybody here has got the oil. And I want to gently bring to you a word as I hear things like this. Oh, I love this church. This is a great church. I hear people every once in a while say, this is the best church I've ever been in. I haven't fallen asleep here once. This is great. And I hope you don't fall asleep. And I hope redeemed people don't fall asleep. And I hope unredeemed people don't fall asleep. But that's not the issue. We're not here to keep you awake. We're not here to entertain you. We're not here to do that. Our bottom line issue as to why we're here is to tell you about the oil. And so the fundamental question to every person here is this. Do you have the oil of the life of God? Because you've got to get your own. It's not automatically here. It's not automatically yours just because you're here. It's not automatically yours just because you even like the church. And it's kind of neat here. There's got to come a time when face-to-face you say to your Redeemer, I need you to give to me the oil, which is my only hope to keep my lamp lit. Verse 10, And while they were going away to make the purchase, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. The door was shut, just like in the days of Noah. Remember the ark? The rains came, people finally started going, Whoa, maybe he was serious. but the door was shut. Oil is available and oil is plentiful, but it is not available and it is not plentiful at midnight. Not in the last day. Not in your last day. And later, verse 11, the other virgins also came saying, Lord, Lord, open for us. But he answered and said, truly I say to you, I do not know you. Matthew chapter 7 says the same thing. It's a passage we're familiar with because we dealt with it some time ago. But it says, in that final day, many will come to me saying, Lord, Lord, didn't we do this and didn't we do that? And we were in the church and we were on the board and we put the mortar between the bricks. And he will say, depart from me. I never knew you. Same thing in Luke 13, 25. Not the same metaphor of a wedding, but the same message. Verse 25, once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door saying, Lord, open up to us. Then he will answer and say to you, I do not know where you're from. And then you will begin to say, you'll remember me now, we ate and drank in your presence. We were there for the worship. And you taught in our streets. We heard your sermons. And he will say, I tell you, I do not know where you are from. Depart from me. They looked ready. They didn't look at all like the evil slave of two weeks ago. They were not the consumers. they had on the garb of God in some sense they were in the assembly they did all the right wedding behaviors but the wedding behaviors they did were not a product of the oil of God in them it was a product of their own doing and in that last moment which would either be the coming of the king or death in that last moment the door is shut and when the door is shut it says in verse 9 that they're supposed to go and get the oil from the dealers When the door is shut, there are no dealers anymore. There is no voice saying, here's where you get the oil. And the dealers of the oil, specifically the ultimate dealer would be Jesus himself, but dealers, plural here, would simply be anybody who can tell you how to get the oil. A dealer could be your mom, your dad, your friend, your son, your daughter, a pastor, prophets, pastors, teachers, parents, friends, people who are simply saying, here's where you get the oil. You can't have mine. Jesus gives it for free. But in that last moment at midnight at death, it's too late. The door is shut. I'm aware of the fact that this is a very heavy word. But even in the light of how heavy it is, I got a good word to balance it with. And the good word is this, that right now, this moment, As you and I sit here, the door is not shut. The door is open. The reason I know that is because you're living and breathing. And so am I. The good news is this, that right now, this moment, as we sit here, not only is the door open, but the oil is available, the oil is plentiful, and the oil is free. And because of that, the Spirit and the bride say to you, Come, and let the one who is thirsty come, And let the one who wishes to take the water or the oil of life without cost come. I want to speak to you in closing here just as directly as I can as your pastor. I think this is an important word for our church. Because God has, in a variety of ways, as I've preached this, made me aware that, again, in a group our size, it still remains for some of you to enter into his rest. And I hope you sense my heart here. I'm not here to yell at you or scare you. My heart here today is to say the oil is available, but you can't have mine, and you can't have ours. You've got to make it yours. There's got to come a time when you look into the face of Jesus and say, you're my only hope to keep my lamp lit. and I would say in the light of Hebrews 4 where it says it still remains for some of you to enter into his rest today today if you hear his voice don't harden your heart over the last nine years that I've been here I've just noticed that through the word of God there come messages that the Spirit of God brings to our church. And there's almost like periods of time that God brings us through teaching that are designed to grow us as a body. And it has seemed to me, however long this lasts, I don't know, but the word from the Spirit to us these last several weeks is this, that it is the will of God that all men be what? Saved. It is my desire that every single person here not just be religious, not just be going through the motions, not just be here at the wedding, celebrating even the sun, but to have the genuine oil of God. I want you to stand as we close. Early in the week, this text came clear to me. I knew what it was about. Early in the week, I knew that it was very important that we gave an invitation of some sort, and we were trying to figure out how to do that. And we tried to think of songs and couldn't think of songs. So he said, we're not supposed to have a song. What I'm going to do is pray. I want to pray for two things. First thing I want to pray is for those of us who are genuinely redeemed. Before, when we were praying with our worship teams, a number of people brought up, and I think it's a good word, that Satan would love nothing more than to take a word like this that is absolutely true and have it land on the heart of someone who does have the oil. Wouldn't Satan love to twist it and have you just stolen of the reality of being able to rest in the oil that you have? I want to pray that the Spirit of God would just come and protect the genuinely redeemed, that this doesn't slime anybody. But those who are the foolish, if you will, using the parable, those who are here but don't have the oil, that the Spirit of God would be released with his power and his resurrection life to bring to you the oil today. I want to pray those two things. Let's pray. Jesus, first of all I ask that you do what I just said. Father, that you would just move among the genuinely redeemed. Those who have the oil and the oil and the oil, by your spirit, you would confirm that they have got the Arban of the Spirit. That they're the betrothed. And I thank you. By your work of the Spirit, you can Do that. And I pray that you would just override everybody's shame, everybody's hurt, everybody's failure this last week that would make them think maybe they're not the one, maybe they don' t belong, but God, that if they are redeemed, that you would just confirm that and bind the enemy in Jesus' name from causing confusion. But Jesus, I pray also, that as the enemy of deception is bound, the enemy deception is bound, that Father, you would indeed release your spirit with power among those here who don't genuinely know you. That first of all, you would identify them to themselves. We're not here to single anybody out at all, that you would do it to themselves, that you would reveal to their own heart that they've got a lot of religion and a lot of wedding behavior, but the oil of the Spirit is void. It's not there. And Father, as you move among us with redeeming, regenerating power, that you would give people the anointed power to realize that they can look into your face right now where they stand and ask you to pour out your grace toward them, to pour out your oil on them. And in Jesus' name, I pray that you do that. I want everybody to be quiet just for a minute. We don't do this very often. This is the only thing I'm going to do with this. I don't believe you need to come forward. There's nothing magical about that. I'm going to give you the opportunity to do that. But right where you stand, face to face with Jesus, you can get the oil of God. And in the quietness of your heart, if the Spirit of God is identified to you that you don't have it, I want you to ask for it. I want those of you who are redeemed to pray and those of you who aren't, to ask for the oil of the life of God if you want it. Let's be quiet. God, I don't know what you've just done. I have felt all weekend that this word was strong and that your spirit was at work in it. And I believe that people this weekend have gone from death to life. And there have been people who have received the oil for the very first time. And I pray in Jesus' name that those who have, that it by your spirit would be confirmed in them, that they would know. Father, for those who need a confirmation, like a human hand on them to pray with them. I pray that you would give them the courage to just come forward and get a hug, get prayer, get some sort of direction possibly, an acknowledgement physically from some other person. I pray that you do that in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
