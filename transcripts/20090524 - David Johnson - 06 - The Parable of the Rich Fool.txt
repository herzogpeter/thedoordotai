For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray as we go to the Word. this is my prayer father that where we are blind particularly to the needs of the least and the lost the poor among us keeping in mind that there are many ways to be poor to be impoverished help us to see and where we have forgotten who we are as God's people and why we're here on the planet as God's people. Help us to remember. And I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. For the last several weeks, as most of you know, we've been dealing with the parables of Jesus, today being the parable that's known as the parable of the rich fool, which was told by Jesus in Luke chapter 12 when someone in the crowd who had been following Jesus and his entourage on the road from Galilee to Jerusalem through Samaria approached Jesus and the group with a request that was actually a kind of demand. In Luke chapter 12 verse 13 saying, Teacher, Rabbi, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me. Because in Jesus' day, the laws of inheritance stipulated that the oldest son would receive the inheritance, which was most likely all of the scholars and the commentaries that I read. The inheritance in those days would likely be land, which is kind of a bizarre thought. I mean, imagine that, a land dispute in the Middle East. Who would have sunk anything like that? It is interesting. There is nothing new under the son. But in this case, the oldest son was not doing what he should have done with the inheritance, at least what he certainly could have done with the inheritance, and that is to distribute the inheritance and share the inheritance with his brother, which would have been just and right and good. So in coming to Jesus, this man is arguing for justice. But what Jesus notices in this argument that seems to be about justice is greed, which is at the root of every form of injustice. And both of the brothers in the story, the brother coming to Jesus with the complaint and the brother that the guy is complaining about, are afflicted with this disease of greed that gives birth to injustice. And that is why in verse 15, Jesus says to them, to the crowd now, not just to the person who has come to him. He's speaking to the group of people around, saying, Beware. And be on your guard against every form of greed, for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions. And then in verse 16, he launches into a parable. He told them then a parable, saying the land of a certain rich man was very productive. And he began reasoning to himself, saying, what shall I do since I have no place to store my crops? Kenneth Bailey, a fascinating book and very helpful for my work here and our work in this parable thing, a book that's entitled Through Peasant Eyes that deals kind of with the historical context of these parables and how the original people would have heard them, says that Middle Eastern ears in Jesus' day would have heard this question of wondering what should I do with this massive wealth that I have as a bizarre question, particularly because of the abject wealth all around that was obvious for everyone to see. So anyone who would ask a question, it's a ludicrous question. It's like, who would ask? What kind of fool would ask a question? How oblivious do you have to be? How isolated could you possibly be from how the whole world is living to even ask a question like that would be the response from people listening to this story. And he said, verse 18, this is what I will do. I have a brilliant idea what I will do with all of this stuff I have amassed for myself, even in light of the poverty which he was blind to. I will tear down my barns and build larger ones. And there I will store all my grain and all my goods. And I will say to my soul, soul, you're in good shape. You have many goods laid up for you for many years to come. Take your ease, eat and drink and be merry. But God said to him, you fool. And this Bailey guy strikes again around this fool word. And Jesus is going to say why he's a fool. But again, in Middle Eastern years, a fool was, there's a word idiot. And we wouldn't call anybody an idiot. That's very demeaning. But in the original use of that word idiot, it was someone who lived outside community. who isolated himself from what was going on with people all around him. We kind of call him the village idiot. It's someone who's totally isolated. You fool, how could you live like this? This very night, verse 20, your soul is required of you. And now who will own what you have prepared? So is the man who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich. Toward God, you fool. now when i read this parable earlier in the weekend was considering whether to preach this particular parable or not the first thing i actually thought was this that we just dealt with this theme not long ago if not this particular parable i remember using this parable as an illustration of the theme a few months ago when we were in the sermon on the mounts where jesus in matthew 6 you may have remembered you may remember this where jesus in matthew 6 says do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon the earth where moth and rust destroy, where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, indeed for several weeks. We talked about God and our stuff. And so earlier in the week when I was wondering whether to do this parable or not and wonder if we should skip it, I thought we should maybe skip it. It's too redundant. It's just too recent to cover it again. And if I kind of pull out that sermon I did two months ago, you might actually notice that it's the exact same one. But I just began to sit on it a little bit longer, and it dawned on me that maybe there was a way to look at this story from a different angle and bring it to a different place by looking at it in the broader context of a bigger story into which this small story, this parabolic story, fits. And it's a story, this bigger story is, that I want to tell you today that I think may actually help us to understand a bit more clearly this little story, this parable story in Luke 12, as dealing with and confronting, actually, a much bigger issue than how we individually spend or hoard our resources in ways that are wise or unwise, in ways that are just or unjust, though the parable does speak to how we individually do that. This parable in the large story I also want to tell you as well also speaks to not just individual but systemic issues or corporate expressions of justice or injustice, particularly as it relates to the poor and how this issue of justice, social justice, that, quite frankly, in the evangelical community that I grew up in, did not always see as a particularly spiritual issue, is, in fact, central to the gospel of the kingdom as Jesus himself understood it and did indeed proclaim it, rooted as it was and is in the Old Testament scriptures. And in the Old Testament scriptures, along with the New Testament scriptures, we hear the story of God revealed. and it's a story, this big story that we have described here at Open Door in the past as a kind of wrestling match as it were between God and his lost creation as he's desiring to call it back home to himself it being the lost creation it being men and women with whom he wants intimate relationship and this wrestling match had a rhythm, still has a rhythm a kind of pattern or cycle that was well-known, if we're not dialed into it, and as I tell it to you, though, you will recognize it as being part of your experience as well, but it was well-known and deeply ingrained into the psyche of first-century Jews in Jesus' day. And the pattern was this, for the people of God, that they were a people, knowing that they were the people of God, they were a people who were marked in their history by a continual cycle of going into exile of some kind and then needing to be restored and restoration coming, of going into slavery of some kind and then being set free of moving from bondage to deliverance, from hopelessness back to promise. A powerful sense of identity as the people of God in the world with a mission in the world as a people and at times operating with that sense of identity and being consistent with the mission, but just as soon as you bat an eye, that identity and mission gives way to self-indulgence and sin, and all of a sudden we're in bondage and exile all over again, such that the cycle was so kind of embedded in their spirits, their DNA, if you will, that if you talk to a first-century Jew about being saved, for instance, this word we talk about a lot, are you saved? If you talk to a first century Jew about that, they wouldn't talk about being saved from hell per se then in the future. They would talk about being saved from hell now. From exile and slavery and hopelessness now as well as hell then. They wouldn't talk just about going to heaven when they die then. they would be talking about being restored and set free and delivered from slavery and hopelessness and exile now as well as heaven in the future. And they wouldn't think that they needed to be saved this way just one time. Because they knew from their story that they needed restoration. And they needed freedom. And they needed deliverance over and over and over again because the cycle was exile, restoration. Back to slavery, then freedom. Identity as the people of God in the world with a mission in the world followed by self-indulgence and sin, which meant bondage and exile all over again. So just kind of keep in mind as I'm talking like this that the way we would talk about being saved and the way they would talk about being saved is very, very different. Let me say it this way. they were the people of God. And so are we. If we are in Christ, we are. So just embrace that and know that that's not up for grabs at all with these people or with us. But though they were the people of God, like us, actually, they were still in continual need on very practical living levels of restoration and repentance and reconciliation and deliverance of being saved in some sense from their sin. Not just forgiven of their sin, though again that was part of the deal, but saved from the bondage of their sin. The thought of which prompts me to borrow a phrase that I heard Rob Bell use in a series of sermons some time ago where he said that Jesus wants to save Christians. Which is a rather provocative thought. Why do you save? I'm already saved. Yeah, you are. This is the whole thing. You are people of God. You belong to God. You are loved by him. You're going to heaven when you die. But there are places of bondage from which we need to be set free, from which we need to be saved. Jesus wants to save us. The point being this, I think, that if the people of God in Jesus' day or in our day were in a continual process of being saved, were in a continual process of being delivered and restored and set free, then maybe we would actually become the light of the world. God's called us to be a city that really is set on a hill, that really can't be hidden, that we really would indeed become. If we were staying in this continual process of being delivered and restored and set free, we would not be storing up treasures on earth, but treasures in heaven, and we would not be building bigger barns for ourselves while the poor and oppressed go hungry and naked. But the fact is, it's for most of us, and I'm in the soup on this with you. Most of us are just as in bondage to our stuff as anybody else we know. So let me tell you the story. The story of God, if you will, and the story the people of God that reveals this cycle, but also sets the larger context for this parable of the rich fool in Luke chapter 12. The story begins in Exodus 3, where the people of God are in a well-known place. And keep in mind, they are the people of God. That's not what's up for grabs here, but they are in Exodus 3, in a well-known place of exile and slavery. They are in Egypt. A word about Egypt as a type. Because beyond the fact that Egypt was a real place with real people who became real slaves, Egypt is a metaphor, a symbol of sorts, of at least two things. It symbolizes two kinds of slavery. First of all, Egypt is a symbol of the bondage to sin that all of us experience individually. All of us individually have places in our lives. We belong to God. We're the people of God. But there are places where we're kind of living in Egypt. So we all have personal Egypts, those places of bondage to sin. It's personal sin, and it could be, and you know what your place is, maybe. It could be anger. And you belong to God, and you're saved in that sense. But you've never been set free from your anger, and it's a place you live. And or at least go to from time to time. it may be for you lust, or maybe it's fear, or maybe it's a need to control, and it controls you, or maybe it's greed, like the parable in Luke chapter 12. And when we go to those places, or get stuck in those places of greed, or lust, or anger, or fear, we're in Egypt. And you maybe wouldn't ever use these kinds of words, but when you find yourself in that place of anger and it's dominating your life you're in egypt and and whatever else that means is means this that you are a long way from home um you're in exile and you know the feeling again you maybe have never used those words to describe the feeling that you have but you are the child of god the son and daughter of the lord most high and you are redeemed in the sense that you're going to heaven when you die, but when you're full of anger, you are a long way from home. You're in bondage. Cut off from the fullness of your potential and destiny as a man or woman of God. And when we find ourselves in those places, not free from those places, we wonder quietly sometimes to ourselves, how did I get here? And how far I am from them? Is there any way to get home, to get out of this Egypt place, to get out of this exile so full of anger and lust and pride and greed. You're in bondage. You're in Egypt. But number two, Egypt is also a symbol not only of individual sins and the slavery that we individually have to those sins, but also it's a symbol of systemic sins, corporate sins, if you will, of injustice and bondage. So Egypt, try to get your head around this, as I try to explain this as best I can, is also the place where sin can actually gather a head of steam. In the context, not just of an individual, but in the context of a group, or a system, or a people, so that people, because of the system, are systematically held down, held out, marginalized, oppressed, enslaved because it's how the system works you talk of family systems and some of you have grown up in family systems and because of the system you grew up in there came with that a kind of slavery a being held out, a being held down a being marginalized there are, and your mind can get into this pretty quickly I think there are political systems economic systems, religious systems family systems, corporate systems that systematically oppress, hold down, push out, keep out, enslave. And in both cases, whether we're talking about individual or systemic, corporate kinds of sins, what's needed is a deliverer, a redeemer, a Moses who will in some way fight for and provide freedom and deliverance fight for salvation so people can somehow be free someone who will show us the way out of our personal egypts into freedom into the land of milk and honey up and out and into a good and spacious land with a relationship with god but also show us the way out of corporate bondage and egypt into corporately as a people moving in a freer place where the least in the lost are noticed and included and brought to restoration and healing individually, corporately. And as I put all of that together, it's why, it's precisely why, on one hand, we desperately need the ministry, and I'll use this kind of as a symbol, a symbolic thing that kind of gets you to see what I mean. We desperately need, on one hand, the ministry of a Billy Graham who is fighting for and declaring individual deliverance and salvation to call individuals up and out from their Egypt into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with life and grace and life in the Spirit and relationship with God. But it's also why when you put these symbols both together of corporate and individual, we also need the ministry of a Martin Luther King who is fighting for systemic deliverance and salvation to call people out of Egypt into free places where the least and the lost are noticed and included and restored because both of those are absolutely consistent with and central to life in the kingdom of God. And in Exodus 3, it was God through Moses who provided all that and the People were saved, redeemed, set free from their exile, no longer in Egypt, which brings us now to the second place. The first is Egypt, the second place of significance in the cycle of their story and our story as well of exile and restoration, slavery and freedom, and what it meant and means to be restored and delivered and saved to second place is Sinai, which speaks symbolically to a number of things, But for our purposes today, I want you to see Sinai as the place where God says, in effect, to his people. And he's continually saying this to us as well. I did not rescue you. I did not save you from Egypt. In order for you to become an exclusive club of redeemed people. Who just sit around and think and talk endlessly about how you've been redeemed. But I rescued you, restored you, and redeemed you. I saved you in order that you might yourself become a rescuer, that you might become yourself a restorer. Spiritually, bringing restoration, yes. Physically, yes, as well. Indeed, it's at Sinai that God gives to his people two fundamental things, both in symbol and reality. In Sinai, God gave to his people, number one, identity, and number two, he gave them mission. exodus 19 verse 5 says this god speaking to his people through moses for you shall be my own possession among all the peoples of the world that is identity next verse verse 6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation you may not see it in the verse until i explain it but that is their mission calling them a kingdom of priests is their mission because the priest whatever else it is they say or do is someone who helps bring people to god who helps people understand and see god who god is and how god works and how it is that you can know him the prophet isaiah said it this way isaiah 49 verse 6 i will make you a light to the nations so that my salvation, that my kind of holistic, if you will, deliverance of spirit and body may reach the ends of the earth. In other words, your salvation, people of God, your deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, both individually and corporately, both spiritually and physically, your deliverance will be good news for the nations. Why? Here's why. Because having been rescued yourself, you will become rescuers. Having been restored yourself, you will become restorers. Having been delivered yourself, you will work toward deliverance. And having become a people of my own possession, you'll begin to show the world who the people of God are by being restorers and reconcilers and champions for justice. And through that, they will come to know me, says the Lord God. So at Sinai, the people got two things. both in symbol and reality they got a sense of identity as a people of god and a sense of mission in the world which brings us to the third place of significance it speaks symbolically to this cycle of god's people um and speaks to why we continually need to be restored and redeemed and it's found in first kings 10 uh where it looks like the people of god because they have actually embraced their identity and are fulfilling their mission. 1 Kings 10 comes at the end of David's rule, which is maybe the first real powerful picture of the people of God understanding who they were as the people of God and living that out in missional ways to reveal who God was to the world. 1 Kings 10 introduces us to this third place, and it's Jerusalem. And so you have Egypt as symbolic of some things, and Sinai as symbolic of some things, and now you have Jerusalem, which is symbolic of some things as well. And among the things it's symbolic of is this. It means we're home. No longer in exile of any kind. They have no longer, they're no longer in Egypt. They're even past just discovering their identity and mission in Sinai. They're living it out in such a way that even outsiders who aren't part of the faith, if you will, like the Queen of Sheba in 1 Kings 10, 9, simply report back to Solomon what she sees, saying in 1 Kings 10, 8, how blessed are your young men. I just look at this and I'm, wow. And how blessed are your servants who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom. Verse 9, blessed be the Lord your God. She's praising God, a God she does not embrace as her God, who obviously, she says, has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel because the Lord loved Israel forever. She could see that and made you king in order to do justice and righteousness. Here's the deal. See, even the queen of Sheba, not a believer in the God of Israel, simply by observing the people of God could tell without even hearing a sermon about it that the people of God had an identity and a mission, and their identity and mission was to do justice and righteousness. Because at some observable level, they were doing that. They were being a light. Good news to the nations. But at the same time, excuse me, at the same time, thank you very much, that all of that was being experienced, And it was really strong in David. So by Solomon's time, some of this begins to entropy. And at another level, while this is still happening in a positive way, at another level it's beginning to crumble as they were beginning, the people of God and Solomon as well, in their prosperity, to forget their identity as the people of God and their mission in the world. The first wind of that forgetting comes in 1 Kings 9.15. It says this, Now this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of God and his own house and Milo, and it mentions several other places, and the wall of Jerusalem. You notice anything strange in there that might indicate that Solomon and the people of God have forgotten their identity as the people of God and their mission as the people of God in the world. well it's in the first phrase there and I think you probably saw it it says this is the account of the forced labor what that means is this they had slaves which at some level if we remember the whole story and we need to how the people began these people of God began in Egypt and then found their identity and their mission in Sinai at some level you got to look at that and go you got to be kidding because because these are a people who once were slaves and now they have slaves, all of which means, among other things, this, that they have now become themselves part of the system of injustice and oppression that they had previously needed deliverance from and that God had wanted to use them to change as the light of the world, no longer the light of the world. They were still the people of God and would have told you about that. But they were becoming just like the world, that they had supposedly been delivered from and called to change and to save. It's amazing, really, when you think about it, though not entirely surprising, because in all of the Jewish festivals, even today, the key word throughout these festivals is remember. Remember. Remember what? Almost always, even today, it's this. Remember Egypt and what it felt like to be a slave. But by the time they got to Jerusalem, under the reign of Solomon, they didn't remember. And if they did remember being slaves, what they remembered about being slaves was that it was horrible to be a slave. Much better. to have one than to be one. And there's your cycle. There's the cycle. The cycle that was well known and deeply ingrained into the psyche of first century Jews. It begins in Egypt, which was the place of individual and corporate or systemic bondage and sin from which you need to be saved and delivered individually and corporately, followed by Sinai, where having been redeemed, in a variety of ways. They got two things, a sense of identity as the people of God and mission as well as the people of God who are the light of the world, having been restored. We set our entire lives and all of our resources are released to becoming restorers and reconcilers and healers of the world, tecunolam, the people of God, the great dream of God, to heal the world, followed by Jerusalem. where having tasted their identity and their mission, the people of God begin to do what the people of God do. Forget who they are and where they're from, Egypt, and why they're here. And soon, almost in the bad of an eye, it's not a bad of an eye, it takes place slowly, but before you know it, They need deliverance, and they need saving, and they need awakening all over again. Indeed, in 1 Kings 11.1, it says King Solomon began to unravel on a personal level as well, morally, not just in terms of corporate sin and systemic thing that was ignoring the least and the lost and enslaving them. He had become a slave to personal sin, 1 Kings 11.1 says. says that he was involving himself with many foreign women, among them the daughter of Pharaoh, in addition to Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonite, and Hittite women as well. Verse 3 reveals that he had 700 wives and 300 concubines. And it came about, verse 4, that when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart away to follow after other gods. So his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God, As the heart of David his father had been, or as his heart as a younger man had been. He was still a people of God, but something is lost. You've wandered away. You're far from home. And when you pull it all together, the picture you get is this. That Solomon and the people of God had slowly, slowly, again it takes time to do this, but they had slowly built a kingdom of comfort and complacency and excess. And they would have called it the kingdom of God, but it was a kingdom of comfort, complacency, and excess where the top priority now was their own pleasure and preservation and the accumulation of more. More women, more wives, more wealth, more people that we can use for our purposes, slaves, having forgotten their identity as the people of God and their mission as the people of God. Now, they would have still said, we're the people of God, but their expression of the people of God now would have been an almost arrogant thing. We're the people of God, not you. That would have been it. but they had forgotten entirely their identity and their mission. Having been restored, God has called us now to use every resource we have, money and other things as well, to be restorers ourselves. But they had become blind to their own greed and sin and to the desperate needs of people and nations all around them in Solomon's day who desperately needed the redemption and restoration that they had by God's grace received in themselves. All this wealth we have, they thought. A sure sign of God's blessing is what it is. It's ours. We deserve it. We need more of it. You fools. Which is precisely what God says in the parable of Luke 12 to the man who thought that the resources of his life, in the parable it's money, but it could be any resource you want to talk about that you have been blessed with, had been given to him for him. So he built bigger barns to store them and to hoard them, never once thinking to use them to meet the needs of those around him, needs that were quite desperate in Jesus' day as they are in ours, and hard not to see actually, but he was blinded by his greed. But what if it wasn't just raw greed that blinded him and explains this behavior here? What if, like Solomon, and the people of God in every generation pretty much at one time or another do, what if he forgot who he was and where he was from and why he was put on the planet? Because sometimes as individuals we forget it's an individual thing at times. And we become self-absorbed people. And you notice, and your wife will notice it, and my wife notices it. When I'm going to just get totally self, you, it's just you. And you become, when you do that, you become blind. You just can't even see the needs of anybody else. It's just me. But sometimes that individual thing can actually become a corporate kind of forgetting where whole families and churches and communities and countries where a whole people, even the people of God, can forget. And when they do, because they do, we do, when they do, God sends prophets, always have, always will, To remind them of who they are. And where they're from. And why they're here. And the word that the prophets used over and over again, which we kind of cringe from, but it's a wonderful word. The word is repent. Which comes originally from the Hebrew word teshuva, which means return. Hear that word repent that way now, in light of the story I just told you. Return from your exile. You've wandered from home. Repent means return. Repent means come home. Repent means come back to your identity as the people of God and to your mission as God's people in the world. An identity that doesn't make you superior to the world, it makes you and me the servant of the world. Isaiah the prophet said it this way in Isaiah 1.11, speaking for God. To a people who had forgotten. I have grown tired, he says, of your religious observations. Your burnt offerings are worthless to me. Your incense and calling of solemn assemblies is an abomination to me. Such that even when you spread out your hands and worship and pray, I hide my eyes. And even if you multiply your prayers, I will not listen. So repent. Which means come home. Come back. Return to your identity and to your mission as the people of God in the world. And what that looks like in very practical terms is this. It says Isaiah in chapter 1, verse 17, that you go to church more. No, that you learn to do good. That you learn to seek justice, reprove the ruthless, defend the orphan, plead for the widow. Isaiah 58, 6 gets even more specific. Here's what it looks like. That you begin to divide your bread with the hungry. That you bring the homeless poor into the house. That you clothe the naked. That you give yourself to the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted. Then, when you do that, and enter into that, the light, your light, will break out like the dawn. You will be the light of the world, the hope of the world. You will call and the Lord will answer and you will cry and he will say, I'm here. Talk about revival. We pray for revival and we should. And revival almost always comes and we have pictures of what it would look like. Well, it often comes with prophets who declare and call people back to remember but it's not just about a good speaker and a good worship band. It's about remembering and returning to our identity and mission as the people of God in the world who having been restored and redeemed and saved use all the resources we have not to store for ourselves but to give them away for the purpose of restoration, redemption and the saving of the world. raccoon alarm to save the world. And he who has ears to hear, let him hear. He who has eyes to see, let them see. And may it be us, individually, but corporately as well. Would you stand with me? I want to pray a prayer over you, a benediction over you. And it's an instant prayer I started the sermon with. Father in heaven where we are blind particularly to the needs of the least and the lost the poor among us acknowledging that there are many many ways to be poor impoverished, need help where we are blind to that, help us see and Father where we have forgotten who we are and why we're here help us by your grace to remember and return. And all these things I pray in Jesus' name and God's people said, Amen. God bless you as you leave. Thank you.
