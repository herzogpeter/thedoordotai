Ephesians chapter 6 verse 13 Therefore, take up the full armor of God that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. Stand firm, therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace, in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, with all prayer and petition at all times in the Spirit. Let's pray. Father, this morning, as we open your word, I pray very specifically for an anointing of your Spirit. Lord Jesus, this morning we are opening your word and we are going to be talking about your word, the sword. And Father, as my heart has been consumed with this all week long, I pray that as we now break this, that the characteristic we will remember more than anything else is the power and the life that can be found in this precious book. I pray, Jesus, that you would have your way, first of all with me this morning, and then with all of us, that your word would be allowed to pierce and divide and to guide and to change us. I ask this in your name. Amen. We have been discovering these last few weeks that contrary to some popular notions, the Christian life is not like skipping through daisies. In fact, if we were going to give an accurate description of what the Christian life is really like when we're growing in grace and really beginning to strip off the old and put on the new. It's a lot more like walking through minefields with snipers on every side. Chapter 6, verse 12 says, We wrestle not against flesh and blood. That would be easy if we did, but our struggle, our wrestling match is against rulers, against powers, against world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. We've been discovering that this is a war. And all the way through the New Testament, we are seeing the exhortation to believers to be prepared for that war, to be prepared for the conflict that we are going to have as believers. Hebrews chapter 12 calls the Christian life a race. 1 Corinthians chapter 9 calls the Christian life a fight. 1 Peter 5 tells us that we have an enemy, and we need to be prepared to meet that enemy and to resist that enemy. Philippians 3 exhorts the believer to keep pressing on and don't look back. It's because this is a war. The other thing that we, however, need to remember very graphically is simply this, that although we are in a war, and Satan, even this very moment, is moving against me and moving against you to receive from the Holy Spirit those things that would bring us into growth and into the fullness of God, that we have the resources to totally defeat that enemy. And thus we come to Ephesians 6, verses 13 through 17. Therefore, take up the full armor of God. Now that's just a lot of hype. Verses 10 through 12 is telling us to put that armor on. You're in a war, so put that armor on. But then in verses 14 and following, Paul for us begins to delineate these pieces of armor. How to put them on and what they do when they're there. And how they protect me and sustain me in the warfare that inevitably I am going to enter into. First of all, verse 14, having girded your loins with truthfulness. We call that the belt of readiness, the belt of commitment. I put that on, and that is simply the thing that gets me going. One of the things we are dealing with and needing to remember over and over again that once as a believer, I have placed that belt of readiness that pulls all the loose ends of my life in. I don't take it off and put it on and take it off and put it on. The time has come for us believers to leave behind the elementary things and move on to maturity. Having committed yourself to this warfare, leave it on and begin to move into the warfare. One of the real strong things that we learned in the placing on of this equipment, however, was this. That the belt of commitment, as important as that is, and as much as we stress it over and over and over again in evangelical churches, it is not enough to win the war. We can be real sincere and totally committed, but if we wade into warfare with nothing but a belt of sincere commitment, we're going to get blasted, put on the whole armor of God. So we moved on. Lock in the breastplate of righteousness, verse 14. We learned there that the worst mistake we could make in placing on the breastplate of righteousness would be to do what we so normally do, and that is to put on a breastplate that is made of my own righteousness, My worthy walk, that is a breastplate that will not protect us. What I place on my chest to protect my vital organs, my areas where I feel things and get so discouraged, is the righteousness that Christ has imputed to me. By faith I put it on and I stand in that, believing that what he promised he is able also to perform. Third, prepare your feet with the shoes that are made of the gospel of peace. Simply this, that which gives me the ability to stand firm and to not slip and slide all over the place is the gospel of peace. The fact that God is at peace with me. He is on my side. Who is the one who can bring a charge against God's elect? God? Heavens, no, He's the one who justifies. He's on your side. Stand in those shoes. Then we came to verse 16. And we notice that something changes here. The words go like this. In addition to all, Now we know that that doesn't mean that these next pieces are any more important. It is simply saying, on top of those, put these on. But the verb does change. Instead of having put on, it says taking up. And we discovered that those three pieces of armor that came at the beginning are pieces of armor that for the believer should be put on and remain on. Don't put them on and take them off. Put them on and leave them on. But there are times in the warfare that you and I go through every day that that battle intensifies and the arrows really begin to move and I'm really under attack. And it's at those times that I take up the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit. The shield of faith. Two weeks ago we discovered that the shield of faith that protects me from the fiery darts is simply this, that when by an act of my will I choose to believe God instead of Satan. Okay, that sounds very simple, But that's all I can give you this morning. I want to keep moving here. But you need to grab that. The shield of faith that protects me against the fiery darts of the evil one is when by an act of my will I choose to believe God instead of Satan. And you remember the key phrase that we were learning in that particular study was basically this. In my warfare with Satan and deciding whether I'm going to live by faith or not, the key phrase was basically this. That who I believe is going to determine what I do. Who I believe is going to determine what I do. And sometimes it's even going to determine how I feel. God says basically this, David Johnson, this is what is going to bring you joy. This is what is going to bring you fulfillment. This is going to bring you into the fullness of life. Satan, on the other hand, comes along with a whole other brand of joy, a whole other brand of fulfillment, and a whole other brand of fullness of life. Who I believe is going to determine what I do. The shield of faith is coming over here and standing behind it and saying, God, I believe you. and by faith Abraham went into a strange land and by faith believing God Noah built an ark and by faith Gideon went into warfare with only 300 men he chose to believe God and he quenched all the fiery darts of the wicked one an act of his will the shield of faith when I choose to believe God then we went on to the helmet of salvation which is the word of God and we just had a chance last time we met to introduce this particular piece of armor. The helmet, obviously, is that part of equipment that protects the head. Very important piece of equipment. Primarily, in the battle, the Roman soldier would be wearing the helmet partly to deflect things like arrows and things like that that might graze against his head. But basically, the reason they would wear this helmet was to be protecting them when they were in hand-to-hand combat. When the sword was swinging around and they were really in hand-to-hand combat, the helmet was that which was going to deflect the blows from another soldier's sword. And that which protects me in the spiritual warfare from that kind of onslaught of Satan when he comes at me with his sword is the helmet of salvation. Now, the helmet of salvation, what do we know about that so far? What we know for sure is basically this, That the helmet of salvation does not mean go get saved. Having put on all these other pieces of equipment, Paul is not saying here, now go get saved. That is not what it's dealing with. Rather, we are dealing with something here that is speaking to a believer who's in the middle of warfare, and he says basically, this believer, what you need to do when the battle really gets hot is in ways that maybe in your normal everyday life you won't have to do. But when it really gets hot, put on the fullness of your salvation. You need to bathe yourself and strap on your head the fullness of your salvation. What do I mean by that? Well, last time we dealt with this, we discovered the fact that biblical salvation has three dimensions. You remember that? Biblical salvation has three dimensions, and you need to remember that. There is a past dimension to your salvation, right? There is a present dimension to your salvation, and there is a future dimension to your salvation. The past is what? Justification. I am justified. If I have received Christ into my life, He has declared me righteous, I am justified, just as if I never sinned. But there is also a present dimension of my salvation, and that is this, sanctification. Not only did God justify me, but He is, present tense, sanctifying me, creating in me the righteousness of God on a practical level. But there is also a future dimension of salvation, and that is glorification. So not only am I justified past, am I being sanctified present, but I'm going to be glorified future. That believer is a definition of the security of the believer, isn't it? Past, present, future, secure. It's there. When the battle really starts waging, strap on that helmet. I am secure. I am His. Nothing can separate me from the love of Christ. The best verse for you to remember concerning this particular point of theology is Philippians 1.6. Do you remember that? For I am confident of this very thing. What very thing? That He, God, who began a good work in me, justification, will continue that sanctification until the day of salvation. Glorification. I am secure. And the reason I need to strap that on is because there are going to be times in my life when Satan comes at me with his broadsword, trying to steal from me the reality of that fact. And we talked about the fact two weeks ago that he comes at me with discouragement. And when Satan comes at me with a broad sort of discouragement, I strap that helmet on. And the dimension of the helmet that I strap on when discouragement comes, and I feel fatigued, and yes, I'm walking by faith, and yes, I love the Lord, and yes, I'm in the middle of the battle, but I'm just tired and I'm weary in well-doing and I want to quit. We found that the dimension of this helmet of salvation that keeps me going is the same thing that kept Paul going when the going really got tough and there was only one thing that kept him going and that was simply this. That I know there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness that is going to be mine. And so I don't just sit and dwell on this flowery bed of ease concept that is going to float me off without any pain. What that concept does, the future dimension of my salvation as I strap it on, keeps me going no matter what. But I want to tell you something And this is where I need to give you some more teaching on the helmet of salvation. There's another weapon that Satan will use against your heart and your mind that the helmet of salvation is designed to protect you from. And it is more than discouragement. It is the problem of doubt. I believe that primarily Satan is going to come to you with a broad sort of doubt. And he is going to try to lop your head right off. And we strap on the helmet of salvation when those doubts begin to come. And I guess what I need to explain is the doubts I'm talking about are the doubts that you and I have from time to time concerning our very salvation. Am I really His? Did I really make that commitment? Is it really for sure? Am I really secure? I want to explain something to you. And you know, this morning, I don't apologize for this, but I do need to explain. There's going to be a lot of teaching here, and you need to really hang with me. I believe this is terribly important. If Jesus Christ is taken to his residence in your life, there is nothing that Satan can do about that. He cannot remove that fact. You have been, what? Justified. You are being, what? Sanctified. You will be glorified. That's a fact. Satan can't move into that territory. But he can, we have learned in the warfare, steal from you the reality of that security, he sure can. And what he wants to do is get you to doubt the completeness of Christ's work in your life. And I believe it's one of the most effective weapons that Satan has against the heart and the mind of the believer. I believe that there are people who have been sitting in pews all their lives feeling like they really don't have anything to offer, really don't have anything to give, because they really don't feel like they're fully accepted, fully loved, really forgiven. They kind of accept the doctrines and it makes them feel a little bit okay, but they just don't, they haven't really, as Hebrews is going to talk about it, rested in the completeness of Christ's work. They're kind of waiting for something to happen to them until they get really spiritual so they know they'll be accepted. I want to tell you something. Satan is going to come against you and he's going to attack your mind and what he's going to do is he's going to remind you of your past, first of all. Some of you come from pasts that you're not real proud of. And there are things that happen to you in some time that every once in a while just creep up into your mind, and Satan comes to you and says, Do you really believe you're forgiven? Come on, what are you, nuts? You remember what you did? And that thing just begins to come back at you. I know that happens. He'll come to you, believer, right after you've moved into sin. And he's going to say things to you like this. You think you're a Christian? who do you think you're fooling? You hear the sermon Sunday and they were talking about hypocrisy and all that kind of stuff and you're the biggest hypocrite there ever was. You think you're a Christian, you're nuts. And he's going to move against you and say things, why would the Lord save you? You can't earn it. You don't deserve it. You're never going to make it. You've really blown it this time. Anybody here ever felt like that? Nobody here, I'm sure. But you know, one of the reasons I believe those kinds of attacks when he comes at me and says, Johnson, you don't deserve it. You've really blown it. You're never going to make it. The reason that attack is so effective with me and is so effective with you in creating doubt concerning the past, present, and future dimension of my salvation. You know why it's so effective? Because everything he says is true. That's why. Because I can't make it and I don't deserve it and I really have blown it. And that's why, believer, and that is when, believer, I strap on the helmet of salvation. I need to understand what salvation is. You don't deserve it. You never can make it. You really have blown it. But God demonstrated His love toward us and that while we were yet sinners, He died for us. Romans 4.5 says, but to Him, I'm sorry, Romans 3.23 says, you're right. All have sinned and all fall short. Yes, you're right. Your assessment of your life is correct. You have blown it. But it also goes on to say this, but if you have by faith received the gift of God's grace and placed your trust in that gift that He offers you, verse 24 says, you have been justified. And I would add to that, you are being sanctified and you will be glorified. Strap it on. Romans 4, 5, but to him that worketh not, you can't earn it. You don't deserve it. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. This is so basic. And you've heard it over and over again. But every once in a while, you need to strap it on again, don't you? Because the doubts are going to come. And every once in a while, you know, as I was preparing this, I was thinking, you know, I know there's a lot of new believers in our church, and some of them might even be struggling with this, but I don't believe this is just a new believer struggle. I believe every one of us from time to time struggle with this very thing. And I'm going to tell you something, believer. If you're going to be victorious in the war, you've got to strap that helmet on and believe it. I am justified. It has been done. And nothing can change it. He's going to move against you with those kinds of doubts. He's going to use other angles too. He's going to come and say things like this. Maybe this has worked with you. how do you know you meant it when you did it huh you ever go through that one how do you know you really meant it when you did it maybe what you ought to do is you ought to accept Christ again and again again again and over and over every time the preacher really hits a nerve with you you just go forward and you accept him again you're crying and you're real sincere you know what's wrong you haven't strapped on the helmet. You've already got it. You need to strap it on. You need to move on to maturity. You need to realize that, again, the basic have been, our being, will be, it's done. Strap it on. You won't win the warfare unless you do. Being justified freely by His grace. That's the helmet of salvation. Other people will come along and teach you that you can lose your salvation. Again, all I can say is this, that we need to understand what salvation is. has been, is being, will be secure. And if you're constantly living in the kind of fear that says every time I sin I can fall out of grace, then you're going to live on a treadmill that's going to pump you right back before the law where you're earning the salvation that God gave as a gift. And that's moving into some very serious false teaching. We're going to deal with that also in the book of Hebrews. Other people are going to come along and teach you things like this. And you hear it. And sometimes it even creeps into evangelical churches. I hope not this one. But you never really know. You know, salvation is there, and we're going to talk about it every Sunday, and it's possible, but you never can really know for sure. In fact, when, as a believer, you speak about the fact that I know for sure that I have been, that I am being, and that I will be, they look at you like you're nuts. In fact, in certain kinds of theological circles, for anyone to claim that he knows for sure that he's going to be with God, that he has eternal life, that he is, quote, saved. There is all sorts of problems with that, and you are considered to be some sort of bizarre person for you to believe anything like that. We need to understand something. Again, very, very basic stuff this morning. We need to understand, again, the basis of salvation. The distinctive of Christianity, and I'm going to add a word to that Christianity because the waters have become so terribly muddied as to what that word even means. The characteristic of biblical Christianity is basically this. That you cannot earn your salvation and that when you have received the gift of grace from Christ, you can know that you have eternal life. Every cult that I have ever dealt with is based on a structure that does not know for sure, and it gets you on a treadmill of continually having to earn, continually having to earn, wondering if you're really going to make it. Every other religion, whether they call themselves Christian or not, and many of the religions that are major denominations, even today, that call themselves Christian denominations, are buying into this very same theology that you never really know for sure. That is a doctrine that is unbiblical. And I would have to call satanic. Because it leads me away from placing my trust in God's precious gift through the blood of His Son into believing that somehow I can earn it. But never really knowing if I've done enough. You see, never really knowing if I've done enough puts me on the treadmill of trying to earn it as much as I can. I hope I've done enough. I hope I've done enough. You can't possibly do enough. All you can do is rest and stop and receive the gift that Christ has to offer. The greatest verse concerning this is 1 John 5, 11-13. It says this, And the truth is this, The truth is this, After everything is said that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life. Simple as that. He who does not have the Son does not have life. And then he goes on in verse 13 and says this, These things about eternal life I have written to you who believe in order that you may know that you have eternal life. You have been justified if you're a believer. If you have received that gift, you are being sanctified and you will be glorified. And when the battle starts heating up, you strap it on. And don't forget it. Because Satan's going to come at you with doubt. I've got one more piece of armor and this is the last one. that we're going to deal with. And that's simply this, the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. Let's look at it. Again, a bit of teaching, especially at the beginning. There's all different kinds of swords. And again, just like the Bible was very explicit when it came to the breastplate or the shield of faith, exactly the kind of shield it was, so too we have a descriptive word for the sword. The Greek word for sword in this particular context is the Greek word makaira. It is not the great big broadsword. A broadsword was something that a soldier would hold with two hands and it was a great big long blade and he would have to swing it over his head and basically it was to lock people's heads off, cut them in two, dealing with split personalities and all sorts of things like that, wreaking incredible havoc with people. The problem was that it was a very cumbersome weapon also. This word makaira is something very much more precise. It's the kind of common sword that a soldier would wear into a sheath. It went from anywhere from 6 inches to 18 inches. It was like a saber or a scabbard. And essentially, the nature of this particular sword, the makaira, you think of, when you think of a makaira, you think of something very precise, something that can be placed right between two ribs, you know, Zorro, you know, you can write your name on somebody's chest with this. Very precise, that's important as we go along. I want you to remember that. Something else I want you to know. And this is just to explain the text to you so you understand what's happening here. The sword, and take up the sword of the Spirit. All that means, the of the Spirit, all that means is basically this, that the sword is given to you by the Spirit. Okay? So it is the sword, take up the sword, that the Spirit of God gives to you. Okay? Let's go on from there. What is the sword? Okay? I know this, that it is a sword, it is a precise instrument. It is given to me by the Spirit of God. And the sword is the word of God. But again, I need to stop here and do just a little bit of teaching and just ask you to hang with me so that you get the full meaning of what's going on here. One of the most common Greek words that almost every one of us know is the word logos. Right? Logos. It's on every bookstore that ever was. Logos, bookstore, all these kinds of things. It simply means word. Okay? It's a very common word in the Greek for the word word. You know I was going to have trouble when I was going to word word. We were telling you what the word meant. The word for word is word. It's logos. Okay? But there's another word for the word word. And that's ramos. And you need to know something that the word logos in the Greek is a very general broad word. If I was to say the logos of God, it would be the Bible in general. Okay? Just generally the Bible. When we say Ramos, which is this word here, we are talking about a specific, precise word. You know what the sword of the Spirit is? The sword of the Spirit that gives me the ability to go into victory when Satan is attacking me is not the Logos of God. It is not the general knowledge of the Bible. It is not going to school with it under my arm. It is not having six of them on my coffee table. It is not the general Logos. It is the Ramos of God. It is the specific Word of God. That which protects me in the warfare is when I know the Word of God, the verse for the situation. Got that? Really important. That tells me a lot about what I need to know about the sword, doesn't it? I'm getting a hell of the head of myself in the sermon a little bit, but it really does. That means if I'm going to use the precise Word of God to stick it between the ribs, to deal with Satan in a decisive way, I'm going to need to know the Word, aren't I? and I believe that's why Jeremiah said in Jeremiah 16, 17 thy words were found and I did eat them and they were to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart the Proverbs and Psalms talk about the word of God and when they do they call it a treasure over and over again that word is used the word of God is like a treasure and you know something when I think about a treasure I don't normally walk along the street and find a treasure hanging just laying there When I'm thinking about a treasure, it's something I've got to dig for. I've got to fight for it. I want to know the truth. Study to show thyself approved. A workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. How do you rightly divide the word of truth? You study it. If you're going to have a precise instrument that helps me defeat Satan when the battles are really raging, I need to know the precise word of God. That means I need to study it. I need to know it. We're going to go on from there because there's more needed than that. but I want to tell you something else and this is this is important because this is the Ramos of God and the Ramos of God is the sword that brings me victory that is why we spend a year and a half in Ephesians that is why because it is not enough dear beloved people to tell to read a text to tell three funny stories and then to go on that would be the Logos that would be the general word of God and that's not going to give us the victory when we need it we're going to spend the time go verse to verse just dissect every single thing we can and when we go to Hebrews it's going to be the same way and we're going to laugh all the way through and joke about how long we take but we're going to do it anyway because the sword of the spirit is the specific word of God and we need to know it. I need to settle down. I'm preaching right now. Would you consider just for a moment with me what it is that we hold in our hand the precious word of God. We could dissect great words and Greek words and you could be real impressed and we could parse them and all that kind of stuff and it's just words, just words. And this could be a lot of good teaching and a lot of good theology and a lot of doctrine and philosophy and it could all be right. But I need more than anything else now to grab not your intellect anymore, but your heart. Because what we're dealing with when we deal with this is God's words. More than God's words, I believe we're dealing right here with God Himself. This, beloved, is where God tells me who He is. In a clearer way than any other place I can ever find it. I can have all sorts of dreams and visions and experiences, but all of those are subjective to me, who I am and what I drank or whatever. But right here, I can find out who He is, what He expects of me, how He works through history, The Word of God becomes for me the evaluator of every experience I have, of everything I think, of everything I know. You know what the Bible tells us? One of the neat things for me, when we were doing John 14, and we were talking about the Holy Spirit and how He came in all His different functions, it dawns on me that we don't even know how to love God, except the Word tells us how to love Him. Because if it was left up to me, the way I would love God would be to come to church and feel nice, warm, and gooey feelings, and try to shed a tear, oh my, I must really love God. You know what the Bible says in terms of specific Ramos? David Johnson, here's how you love God. Jesus said it to his disciples. If you love me, you'll do what I say. There you go. Now I know how to love him. I don't even know how to do that except by the word telling me that. Every move I make, everything I think, every direction I go can be dictated to me by the words of God. Right here, his book. 2 Peter 1, 16-21 says listen folks we do not follow cleverly devised tales you need to know this that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of one's own interpretation don't go listen to this guy and listen to that guy and that experience and that experience that little dream and that little vision oh my goodness all these incredible things how do I filter through all that? what I know is this I don't know about your experience what I know is this that men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God and these are God's words we could go on and on reading scripture about how the word of God describes itself Hebrews 4, 12 most famous the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit bone and marrow and judges the thoughts and intents of the heart that's the word of God it's alive it reveals the thoughts and intents to myself. It convicts. In fact, that verse reveals to me something of the nature of the Word of God that it is not just words, but it is living because it's Him and His Spirit is breathing through these pages. It's authoritative. It's sufficient to make me wise to salvation. 2 Timothy 3. It's a source of guidance. Psalm 119, 105. That Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. The Word is our source for growth. 1 Peter 2, 2. Like newborn babes long for the pure milk of the word, that by it they may grow it to salvation. And again, I could bop over to Jeremiah, who said, Thy words were found, and I did eat them. Why? Because that's how I grow. Every once in a while you hear people say, you know, I'm going to leave this church, I'm going to go to this church, and because I'm not fed at that church, and I am fed at that church, and I'm going to go where I'm fed, and I can't stay there anymore because I'm just not getting fed. I want to tell you something this is going to sound a little radical but if I'm going to say it anyway but if we're involved in a church and if this church ever turns into the kind of thing and I ever move into a position where we are not hearing the ramas of God the specific word of God you ought to go where it is it's a source of equipping 2 Timothy 3, 16 and 17 all scripture is profitable for doctrine for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, so that the man of God may be adequate, fully equipped for every good work. And one other thing, the word of God is sufficient for and capable to be the source of victory in the warfare. And that brings us right back to the text. It is the source of victory in the warfare in the life of the believer. but it is the remos the specific word of God that gives me that victory we have come to this particular piece of armor and as we come I think that most of you have probably heard this particular passage taught enough to realize that when we come to this the sword of the spirit what we say is this that this is the only offensive weapon it's the only offensive weapon and you take the sword and you carve everybody up with it and you stick them and you get them and it's wonderful and that's an awful lot about like how we've experienced people wielding the sword against us. They carve us up and spit us out and leave us there wounded and bleeding and it just feels wonderful. I want you to know something, that the Word of God, the sword of the Spirit, is not only an offensive weapon. It is just as much. I'm not going to say one is more important than the other. But the Word of God, in terms of this warfare that I am having with Satan, by the way, the warfare that I am having with you is not with you, it is with Satan. And it is against Satan that I use the word as a weapon. But it is just as defensive as it is offensive. Let me explain very quickly. If a Roman soldier was in battle, again, you can picture the imagery. There are times when he's going forward and plunging that sword in between someone's ribs. But that sword is used just as much to deflect blows as it is to inflict. Okay? Jesus, and this is probably the most classic example in the book of Luke chapter 4, Satan, after his wilderness experience, comes against Jesus with all sorts of temptation. And what does Jesus use to parry the blow, to deflect the blow and deal with Satan? He doesn't just jab him, he deflects the blow by doing what? He says this three times, it is written, it is written, it is written, God has said, God has said, God has said, and basically what he's doing, when he's using the word against Satan's attack, is saying this, Satan, you're a liar, you're a liar, you're a liar. And he did it with a word. The rhemas of God. He had to know it to use it. How many times, this just rings in terms of our experience, doesn't it? In mine. How many times Satan begins to move against you, and move against me, and maybe it'll be in that realm that we just talked about, doubting my own salvation, and some of the basics of it. He'll come against you and me, and he'll say, Dave, you're not forgiven. What do you think? I mean, look at what you just did. You're not a son. You're not an heir. That might be for the preacher. That might be for the elders. But it certainly isn't for you. You aren't accepted in the beloved one. You aren't loved. You aren't warm. What do you say when that attack comes? Usually if we don't have the Ramos, if we don't have the word of God to deal with that, usually what we say is, I guess you're right. And we walk away defeated with our tail between our legs and we just buy it. Again, that's just believing Satan instead of God. What I need to do at a time like that when Satan begins to move against me with his lies is say what Jesus said in the wilderness. Satan, you're a liar. You're a liar. You're a liar. And I don't even feel it. I feel unloved and I feel unaccepted, but the Ramos of God says I'm not. And I'm going to use that sword against those lies that move against my mind. 1 John 1.9 says, Satan, if I confess my sin, he's faithful and just to forgive. And I have and I'm forgiven and I don't care what you try to bring into my mind. I'm going to choose to believe him. Romans 8.1, there is now therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ. I'm going to believe that and I'm going to use that against you when you move against me. Ephesians 1, 4 and 5, turn to it. It's right there. Just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. Do you believe that? That's the sword. When he moves against you with all those doubts, that's the sword. We have redemption in him, verse 7. Through his blood, the forgiveness of our sin, the best place to look would simply be in chapter 2, verse 1. And you were dead in your trespasses and your sins, verse 4. But God, being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, he has made us alive. I am redeemed. I am forgiven. I am accepted. I am a son and I have an inheritance. And Satan, you're a liar. That's the sword of the Spirit. And I use it defensively. And he'll move against me with other things too. He'll move against me with fear. And when he moves against me with fear, I don't deny it and say, I'm not afraid, I'm strong. No, but I do use the sword. And I go to the Word and it says this, Dear friend, dear beloved who is hurting, behold, the Lord's hand is not short. that he cannot save. Neither is his ear heavy that he cannot hear. God is my refuge and strength, a very present help in a time of trouble. I take out my sword and I parry the blow. And he comes with despair. And I think of Job who finally hit bottom. Do you remember that series we had in Job when he went into the pit and the dust was just kind of floating around him and there was no more hope and there was no more energy and there was no more fight left in him. And he came down to the bottom line in his life and he says, what do I know for sure? And his first answer to that was nothing. I don't know nothing for sure. But then he came out of that pit saying basically this, yes I do, I know one thing. I know one thing. I know that my Redeemer lives and He will stand and so will I. Write it on a rock. That's the sword. It can be used as a defensive weapon and we need to learn how to do that. It is also an offensive weapon and we need to understand that also. again it is not used against people but it is used to carve holes in the kingdom that Satan has in this world and again the imagery that I'd like to share with you that I have would be as if in the death and destruction that Satan would weave in our society the sword of the spirit is that which can go into that jungle and begin to hack away and to knock out the weeds and bring people into life who have been held captive by the weeds just choking the life out of them And we go into situations and we go into crystal. And what we go into crystal with is the Word, the sword of the Spirit. And you don't go into it with your philosophy. And we don't go into it with unbelievable programs. We go into our neighborhood and our community with the Word of God. And that's what's going to hack away at His kingdom. And we are going to build our church not with unbelievable programs, but with the Word of God. The Ramos, the specific Word. It's the sword. It's this sword that allows us to walk into Satan's domain and knock holes in it to set men free. And that's why we preach it. And that's why we teach it. And that's why we sit down with our children and tell them about it. But as I wrap this up, I need to say one more thing. That everything I've said so far is just the description of the sword. And for many of us, the sword that I have described, all its power, all its resource, all its ability to hack holes in Satan's dominion, and I believe it can, and I believe it will, but I also believe that for many believers, some of us here right now, the sword that I have just described is just the sword that I have described. It is laying there, and it's real beautiful, and I love it, and it sparkles. But for some reason or another, my whole Christian life, I've never been able to walk over to that weapon and grab it, pick it up, and wield it, and at the same time have some sort of sense that God is moving through it. That somehow there is authority here. I have quoted its words. I have memorized it. I have studied it. But I have never sensed that piercing ability. I think we all know that it's possible for us to have a house full of Bibles just stacked from top to bottom and never have a sword. Never have a sword. What I need to know is how do I grip it? How do I put my arm around that grip so that I can use it not only to defend myself against Satan's attack but to hack holes in Satan's kingdom? And that's what we've been called to do. What do I do to get a grip on that? Yes, we need to know the Word. I've already gone over that. There is no way, friend, that we can embrace the promises of God if I don't know them. Can you? I mean, I can't defend myself from the attacks of Satan if I don't know what the Word says about dealing with that. It's impossible to do that. But I need to also say this. Knowing the Word is not enough. Knowing the Word is not enough. And I'm even going to go a step further, and I'm not even sure I agree with this, but I'm going to do it to shake you up. It's not even the most important thing. See, I am painfully aware this morning that it is possible to know the Word of God, to study the Word of God, to memorize it, to carry it around to school, to dissect it, to stand up in front of people and preach it, to tell my children about it, to yell at my neighbors with it, to use it on my kids, to get them to shape up with it. And all the time thinking, I'm wielding a sword, I'm wielding a sword. But the people on the other end are never receiving it. you see I think it's possible to study it and memorize it and dissect it and still never really embrace it and still never really have a grip on it that rings with the power of God that rings with the authority of God and what just flips around in my mind and buzzes around my head is this what is the missing ingredient that turns that word into a sword and just in closing just one simple thought that I want to leave with you and let it go around in your mind all day long and all through the week and the rest of your life. Because I believe the missing ingredient for many of us that would give us the ability to turn words on a page into a sword, into the sword of the Spirit, into an instrument that rings with God's authority and power is not my knowledge of the Word, but rather my submission to it. it is not my preaching of it but my living of it that is so simple isn't it how profound see I don't think the sword friend can go this way until it's gone this way I read an article not too long ago I found it quite a while ago but I read it again this week found it in World Vision by Stan Moonahan and he was talking about this very thing and he was doing some speculation about the sword of the spirit and his speculation led him to bring the possibility that the sword of the Spirit which we embrace is a sword that we need to be aware of and the thing we need to be aware of is simply this, that it is a sword that doesn't have a handle. It isn't real comfortable, you know? Don't we love to do that? Don't we love to take the Word and dissect our kids with it and dissect our pastor and dissect the congregation with it? So comfortable and feels so good. But what he said was basically this, we need to know something about the sword of the Spirit and that's maybe that it doesn't have a handle. And then when I embrace it and try to bring it out to you, what it's doing at the same time is causing me to be cut and me to be wounded and me to be bruised. And I think that is absolutely vital. And I think it is when I turn that sword on myself and when you turn the sword on yourself that it turns from the words into a sword that rings with authority and rings with the power of God. let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speech be put away from you and I can say it this way let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor you know when that has authority you know when that has the power of God when first it's come this way Thank you.
