Thank you. Let's pray as we go to the ministry of the Word this morning. Father, in light of where we're going this morning in the Word, my request, my desire is this, that you would give to me and that you would give to us, your people, the spirit of the prophets, the spirit of the psalmists, the spirit of the rabbis, indeed our Rabbi Jesus, Who said, I love your law. Oh, taste and see that God is good. For his law is sweeter than honey. Yes, sweeter than the drippings of the honeycomb. Help us enter into the reality of that. In Jesus' name, amen. As most of you know, for the last several weeks, in the context of this series of sermons we're referring to as the way of the rabbi, we have of late been talking about the importance of understanding the message and the mission of Jesus in light of the fact that Jesus was himself a Torah observant Jew. The Torah, or Torah, depending on how you pronounce it, being the first five books of the Old Testament. It's also referred to as the five books of Moses, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. It's also spoken of and referred to as being the Pentateuch or the law. Indeed, Jesus' entire frame of reference we've been careful to note over the last few weeks was the Old Testament scriptures. Not Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, but Moses and the prophets was what he grew up on. That was the Bible he studied that formed his mind and stirred his heart as to who God was and who God is and how God works in the world. And it's why for the last several weeks and why now for the next several weeks. We're going to be in the Old Testament where I hope we will discover and then come to deeply treasure at least two things. The first is this, that we will come to discover the God that Jesus knew, particularly the God that he came to know in the context of the Old Testament, not distant or angry as is sometimes our impression of God in the Old Testament, something we dealt with at length a couple of weeks ago in the context of that sermon we called God at War. Remember that? What's up with that? The second thing I hope we're going to discover as we do this for some weeks is not just the God that Jesus knew, but the law, to discover the law that Jesus loved. The law. That when misused can suffocate and kill, no doubt, But when authentically lived into by the power of the Spirit, the law is an expression of freedom and joy, of fullness of life, of fulfillment indeed of your destiny as a person, as the people of God. I mean, think about it like this. Imagine if you can, being in a community of people. Just try to put this on and fantasize about it. where everyone in the community desired more than anything else to figure out what it meant to put God first and accept no substitutes, have no false gods among them, to realize that sometimes they do, but their deepest desire was to figure out what it meant to have God at the very center of not only their personal lives, but their community life as, well, first commandment, beloved, in the law. The first commandment in the law is just that very thing. Exodus 20, verse 3, you shall have no gods but me. You shall not make for yourself an idol. Imagine, can you? Can you just imagine? Can you smell it, begin to taste it? What it would feel like to be among a people where the name of God was authentically reverenced. Where when we came to worship, the priority was just stirring in our hearts the reverence of God, which is, by the way, the second commandment in the law, Exodus 20, verse 7. Not just spoken the name of God, but revered. You think if that really was the spirit of everyone in the context of worship, it would have some effect on the experience of worship itself. Dream with me about being in a place where you don't have to guard your heart or wonder what people meant by what they said, because people simply said what they meant. They didn't lie. You've been in that, haven't you? In a meeting or just with a group of people or maybe at the family table. It's part of what you dread about being at the table because this word is said and the smile is on the face, but it feels like a barb and you can't figure it out because there's something behind the words. They don't say what they mean. Just imagine being in a community of people that didn't lie, thou shalt not lie, so you could trust them. Wow. I mean try to imagine just try to imagine being in a place where husbands and wives felt safe and secure in the exclusive embrace of their one and only spouse thou shalt not commit adultery and never even having to wonder what some people wonder in the middle of the night where else they would rather be or who else they might rather have. Imagine never having to even think about that. Why, that would feel like heaven. And it's why the psalmist, beloved, in places like Psalm 119 says things like this, Oh, how I love your law. And he goes on to say, Teach me, this is what I want for you. Teach me the way of thy statutes, and I shall observe them to the end. Give me understanding, God. I want to understand this and how it actually works in my life that I may observe their law and keep it with all my heart, not just outside but inside too. For the law of the Lord is perfect. That's what I understand about it. Restoring, it has the capacity to restore my weary soul. The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The precepts of the Lord are right, bringing joy to the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, bringing light to the eyes. The law is a lamp to my feet, a light to my path, showing me where to go and where not to go so I don't stumble and fall and hurt myself and destroy my family. How sweet are they words to my taste, yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth. Oh, how I love thy law. I wonder if you remember back in January when we just began this series on the way of the rabbi, We talked about how whenever the Torah was read in the synagogue, the rabbi, remember, would kiss the scroll. He would kiss the scroll. And then holding the scroll, the Torah, over his head, he would dance a dance of joy and lead the people in the dance. For we have in our hands and in our hearts and in our minds and in our mouths the very words of God. So people of God sing and dance and shout for joy. And then at the beginning of this series, we talked about Bet Sefer. remember that? that sephir was the Hebrew school where children in Jesus' day from the ages of 6 to 10 would begin to memorize Torah and one of the things the rabbis would often do as the lesson began was to take their writing tablets the children's tablets upon which they were going to write the words of God indeed memorize all of the Torah the Pentateuch but before sometimes the lesson would begin they would take the tablets and cover them with honey remember that? and then the rabbi would tell the children the story of Ezekiel. Children, I'm going to tell you the story of Ezekiel who tasted the scroll and said that it was sweet, yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth. And then he would tell them the story of Jeremiah who said that words were founded, I did eat them, and they were to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart. So children would say the rabbi, taste, now literally put your finger on the honey that's on the slate and put it to your tongue. Taste and see that God is good. And in that context, their lesson in Torah would begin with great expectation and incredible joy. And it's why when Jesus came and finally began his public ministry, among the first things that he said was this, Matthew 5, 17, do not think that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets. I did not come to abolish but to fulfill this thing, to bring this law that the psalmists and the prophets and the rabbis love to its full expression, to the fullness of its intention, and to show what it looks like. I mean, just think of this being embodied in Jesus himself, our great rabbi, to show the world what it looks like when the precepts of God, when the law of God is really lived in the power of the Spirit, in a spirit of freedom and joy. Imagine the precepts of God being lived out in a person who is fully alive. Like, oh, I don't know, Jesus. Indeed, in Matthew 5, 21, just four verses after, he said, I have not come to abolish the law. Where did you get that idea? He says essentially this, you've heard in the law, you've heard in the law, don't commit murder. And don't commit adultery. But I say, don't even be angry. Let's talk about your lust, which, by the way, doesn't mean we're abolishing the law. We're not doing away with don't commit murder as if that doesn't matter. When I talk about it's not just murder, it's anger. It's not just adultery, it's lust. What I mean by that, says Jesus in the teaching, is bringing it to your anger. That's where the law wants to bring you. That's the fulfilling of it when you can really get set free, not just from not murdering people. Most of you aren't going to murder someone, but you're full of rage. What if the law was beginning to be so, the precepts of God were so fulfilled in you that you were becoming free from your anger and free from your lust? Do not think I've come to abolish the law and the prophets. I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill. Because it's not just about murder and adultery, it's about anger and lust. And when you begin to taste that, experience some freedom there, what it means is the precepts of God are coming to fruit. They're being fulfilled. And that's what's sweeter than honey to my taste. It's actually kind of weird when you think about this because part of the reason that Jesus had to explain even that he didn't come to abolish the law was because he broke a lot of rules. And when he broke these rules, people kind of thought, what are you here to break the law? You don't care about the law? You're here to abolish the law. He broke a lot of rules. Like healing on the Sabbath. Remember the Sabbath to keep it holy. It is one of the commandments of the law. A law that was designed by God, and we'll talk about this in a few weeks, I think. A law designed by God to be for the people of God the best day of the week. The day that you look forward to more than any other day. It was a day that you could just put it all down. It would be put all the striving down, put all the producing down, and just enjoy the presence of God in the cool of the day. It was to be the best day. It was to be a replenishing day, a restorative day, but in the hands of religious people who didn't really understand the law at all. It became the worst day. It became the worst day of the week, the most cumbersome day, the most restrictive day, the day that you could get in more trouble than any other day, because it was a day that was filled with rules, rules that demonstrated they didn't understand the heart of the law, what God was trying to call his people to at all. So when Jesus heals on the Sabbath, he broke a rule. But what he's saying in the breaking of the rule, at least in part, is this, my breaking the rule here when I heal on the Sabbath does not abolish the law, even the law of the Sabbath. Indeed, this is what it looks like. Me breaking the rule to help someone on the Sabbath, to love someone on the Sabbath, me breaking your rule about the Sabbath is actually what it looks like when the law is being fulfilled. Because the whole law can be fulfilled in two things. He said, you love God, you love people, and everything else, you'll figure out the rest. In fact, one of the things that rabbis, I can't remember if we've talked about this already in this series, but rabbis, their job, as you know, was to have the law and then interpret the law. And they talked about laws that were heavier and lighter. And it was a very important thing to distinguish heavy things from light things. And heavy meaning more important and be careful to observe these more than you would observe these. And when they seem to be in conflict, choose the heavier, more important one. Remember Matthew 23, Jesus says, you tithe dill and mint and cumin. You are very careful about these things that don't matter, but you neglect the way here matters of the law, like mercy, justice, faithfulness. So Jesus loved the law. Jesus loved the law. The precepts of God bring joy to the heart, are sweeter than honey to the taste, and that's why, beloved, for the next few weeks, we're going to spend some time examining the law, particularly as it's revealed in places like Exodus 20, which is as good a place as any to discover the God that Jesus knew from the Old Testament, not distant or angry. And the law that Jesus loved, sweeter than honey to his lips. If you have your Bibles, open them to Exodus chapter 20, verse 1. It's called the Ten Commandments. The Decalogue, deca meaning ten, log, or logos meaning word. The Ten Commandments are, in fact, the ten great words for life. And they begin, very importantly, this sets the context and the trajectory of our understanding and application of this law with these words, verse 1. Then God spoke all these words, saying, I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. It's extremely important that we notice at the beginning that God does two things here. Number one, he says to the people, let me remind you, first of all, of who I am. Before I give you this law, let me remind you of who I am, and secondly, let let me remind You of who You are. I am the Lord Your God. In fact, let me say it this way.I already am the Lord Your God, and You are the already brought out ones. I am already the Lord Your God, and You are already the redeemed out of the house of slavery ones. So the law He is about to give is not being given to them as a means by which they could become redeemed and be set free from Egypt. These are not a list of things that they need to do or not do in order for God to be their God. Let me tell you, from the beginning, I already am your God, and you are already the redeemed ones. You already belong to me in Exodus. In fact, in Exodus 19, 5, a chapter previous to this. He's already calling them his own possession among all the peoples. Again, it's very important that you understand when he gives this law, they already belong to God. They were already loved by him, already the people of God, though not all the people are sure they want to be possessed by him, and thus the wandering and the exile that we've been talking about for the last few weeks, but the point is this. The law that we're about to hear, the law he's about to give is not being given to people who are still in slavery as a way to get out, as a way to earn. In fact, if you do spin the law around and begin to use it that way as the things you think you need to do to get God to like you, then the law will turn to death, and we can talk about that later. Let's just keep it in this context. I am the Lord your God. I am already your God. You are already my people, already called out and redeemed from the house of slavery. It's not here to earn. It was given instead for three things. The first, it was given as an incredible gift to the already bought, redeemed people of God as a wonderful gift, as a wonderful resource, a resource designed to help the already bought people of God to learn how to live in and remain in the freedom that they already had and not be subject again to a yoke of slavery. So here's the question. Let me just frame it like this. So how do you, okay, you've already been redeemed. How do you stay free? How do you not go back to the bondage of sin you had in Egypt? Here's how. Here's how. Just let's start with some simple things. Learn what it means to put me first. When you were in Egypt, you had no idea about that. You had no desire for that. But now you've been redeemed and you belong to me. So let's start our new life this way. Learn, first of all, what it means to put me first and accept no substitutes. Learn what it means to revere my name and observe my day. Learn what it means to honor your parents. And right now, you don't even know how that would connect in any way that would help you stay free. But I have news for you. Just press into that and become devoted to your one and only wife. Don't steal, don't murder, don't lie. And those things, believe it or not, I know this sounds very simple, will help you learn to live in this new place of freedom. Learn to live in this place of freedom from the house of slavery. So at one level, at this basic level, when God gives the law to his already redeemed people, this is pretty basic stuff. It's kind of kindergarten stuff, actually, which I think is exactly what it is, because in many ways, his relationship with the people of God here in the story, And we've been telling this story and kind of seeing the flow of a God calling his creation back to himself. In many ways, they're just beginning together. But at another level, the purpose of the law here that he's giving is more involved than that. Because part of the energy behind these words that we find in Exodus 20 is driven by the fact that the heart of God for his people is not satisfied just to redeem, deliver, and save his people. Indeed, he wants to see his people come into and experience the fullness of their destiny as the people of God in the world. It began in the garden. Remember that? We talked about this a couple weeks ago at Easter. God's great dream for his creation, creating man and woman in his own image, and then saying to them, this is the great dream of God, to partner with his creation and in bringing his creation into its fullness. It's going to grow. It's going to expand. And the great joy of God would be that with his creation, he would be able to see that fulfilled. Tecun Alam, to fulfill the world, to heal the world. But they walked away. And then the great dream began, Tecun Alam, to heal the world. His desire is to see his people not just be saved, from Egypt, but to become literally the light of the world. Kingdom of priests, because they know God can bring people to God. So how would you do that? How do you even start to do that? Step into the fullness of your destiny. Well, there's just this little place to start. Try, first of all, let's just figure out what it means to put God first. To really have him at the center of your everyday, actual life. And you want to step into your destiny? This has nothing to do with you being redeemed. You're already redeemed. But I have more for you than that. How about learning what it means to identify and then reject your false impressions of God and your false gods, what it means to revere his name and observe his day. Want to step into your destiny, the fullness of who God made you to be in the world? Try figuring it out what it means to honor your parents. Because if you did that, even to parents who maybe don't deserve much honor, you might cause some people to scratch their heads and wonder what kind of God do you have? You really want to step into the fullness of your destiny? Well, maybe a really good place to start at a practical level would be to figure out what it means to be faithful to your one and only spouse and learn things like fidelity and love for a flawed human being. In other words, begin to get your life in order under the rule and reign of God, and as you do, you'll not only remain in your freedom and not go back to Egypt, but you'll begin more positively to step into your destiny. You will begin to become the light of the world, becoming the kind of person, the kind of people, who are capable of actually partnering with God in his mission of tikkun olam in the world. But there's even more than that. And the more is revealed in verse 5, where God himself identifies himself as a jealous God. Indeed, verse 3, he says, You shall have no gods but me. You shall not worship them. Worship means it speaks of love. You shall not serve them, which speaks of devotion. For I, the Lord, your God, am a jealous God. Jealous. Again, we kind of pull away from that, but if you keep or at least capture, I think, what is really going on here and what God's real desire here is, what you capture is language that is not simply the language of creator or even redeemer or deliverer. When you talk about a jealousness for you and for whether you love another, this is the language of a lover, which can be a little uncomfortable, quite frankly, because God as lover, This is kind of weird. But if I really would begin to frame him in my mind as a groom, as a lover, that kind of God may want more from me than a phone call twice a week. Or a date on Sunday morning once a week. Here I am, God, tip my hat. But see, if he's a lover, he's going to go, yeah, I want a lot more than that. You may not, you may not, you may not. So that you may not enter into this level of it. You just wanted a redeemer. You wanted a deliverer. You wanted a fixer. You didn't want a lover. God does. But again, it comes with some risk. Because he's going to want more than a walk in the park and a peck on the cheek. Indeed, I believe that one of the best ways and very clear ways that you could understand the Ten Commandments is to see them framed in the context of, among other things, wedding vows. Where God is amazingly saying in Exodus chapter 20, I want more than an arrangement where I am the king and you are the subject, where I am the ruler and you are the slave, where I am the creator and you are the creation, where I am even the deliverer and you are the delivered. I am proposing a marriage. Where I am the groom and you are the bride, a covenant. It's the word he uses over and over in Exodus chapter 20, And this is the covenant I will make with you. And as he describes the covenant and the promises they're going to make to each other, those are the vows. But just like in the garden, before the marriage was consummated in Exodus chapter 20, before the vows were even revealed, the people of God, you probably know the story, wandered off. Moses was up on the mountain working on the vows. And the people crafted a God that was much more to their liking, one they could see, one they could control. And that's why in Exodus 34, a few chapters later, after the groom and the bride have this big fight, Exodus 34 says, behold, I am going to make a covenant with you. Even though you've been unfaithful here, here, and here, I still want to be married to you. More than your deliverer. I want to be the groom. And then he basically says in Exodus 34, among other things, here's what I'm bringing to the marriage. Let me tell you what I'm bringing. It was almost like the dowry. This is what I will, you know, you're marrying, he's basically saying, you're marrying a really rich guy. Because here's what he says. Before all the people, I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth, nor among all the nations, and all the people among whom you live will see my working. Your neighborhood, when you marry me, everybody in the neighborhood is going to go, whoa, whoa, what a guy. You have some kind of God. That's exactly what that means. For it's an awesome thing, it's an awesome thing that I am doing among you, about to do. It's an awesome thing that I want to give you. I have so many resources as the groom to give to you. I mean, it's almost like he's showing off when he says some of this stuff. And the picture is like that of a suitor trying to impress a girl and win her heart. In fact, in Exodus 34, verse 6, it says, then the Lord passed by in front of them saying, here is who I am. I am the Lord. I am the Lord God. Take a good look. And he kind of says, let me show you. I mean, I don't want to be stupid here, but it's like, see my muscles? Marry me. Because he says, take a really good look. I wanted to show you who I am. And then you know what he showed him? His compassion. He didn't show him his muscles. He said, I show you my compassion for I'm compassionate. I'm slow to anger. I'm abounding in loving kindness and truth. I'd be an amazing groom. You have no idea. And if you marry me, enter into this kind of covenant, past redeemer to bride and groom. Everything I am and everything I have is the groom I'll give to you. Just one thing. All your old boyfriends, got to go. Take their pictures off the dresser. Take their phone numbers off your speed dial. I will have no other lovers. You shall have no gods but me. That's exactly what he's saying here. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, which quite frankly may be more than most people bargained for because most people just want a deliverer, not a lover. The fact is there are a number of metaphors in Scripture that paint a picture of and try to capture many facets of our relationship with God. And all of them are true and speak to different levels of interaction that we have with God. Isaiah 64 says, God is the potter and we are the clay. And in that dynamic, the thing that stirs in me is if you're the potter and I'm the clay, I want to stay moldable. I want to be movable to the movings of your spirit. I want to get stiff. I don't want to get bitter and brittle. I want you to be able to come into my life and you be able to do what you want with me without resistance. In another place, he's called shepherd and we are the sheep. And in that metaphor, as the sheep, I'm learning how to follow and how to trust the shepherd. So where you lead me, I will follow. In another place, he is called the master and we are called the servant. And in that metaphor, the energy is to learn to obey and to serve. Not my will, but thine be done, but beyond a hunk of clay and a smelly sheep and an obedient servant. We're also called children, and he is our Abba. And all of a sudden, that brings out the possibility of a whole different kind of intimacy, but also a problem because not all children feel intimate. In fact, not all children feel safe with their father or their mother. So one day, Jesus said to his disciples, now I call you friend. which introduces a level of knowing and being known that sometimes transcends family ties. You know it's true. Some of the closest people to you in your life are not family. Some of them are, but they're not always family. Some of them are friends. To be a friend, oh my, to be a friend of God. But the highest and deepest, most exhilarating and frightening is this, that God is the groom and we are the bride. We're very familiar with that analogy in the New Testament with Christ being the embodiment of the groom. This was in the heart of God from the beginning. Him as groom, we as bride. Frightening is that one because this relationship, this kind of God, again, will want more from me than a date once a week on Sunday morning or a peck on the cheek. See, some say that what God wants most from us is our obedience and servitude. And he does. Others, more therapeutic, say what God really wants most is our happiness, contentment, and self-actualization. And while I'm sure he cares about those things on some level, the bottom line is this, what he really wants is us. All of us. Like a bride would open herself up fully and give herself fully to her groom. That's what I want. says God to his people in the beginning. Exodus 20. The relationship is just beginning to bud. That God's great lament through the prophet Isaiah was this. These people honor me with their lips, which means they do their duty. Their wives in that, you know, they do the dishes. They go to church. They sing, but their hearts. I can't get their hearts. They're like this. And their heart is what I wanted. this is maybe a crazy question but have you ever wondered what it feels like for God to be married to you I mean does he have access to it is there openness is there passion are you just doing your duty Philip Yancey pushes this even further when he says that reading the prophets actually is like hearing a lover's quarrel between through an apartment wall. And when you hear that, it's kind of embarrassing, but it's also very revealing. In Jeremiah 2, God, through the prophet, says this, you are precious and honored in my sight, and I long to be gracious to you. But here's the deal, you're like a swift she-camel running here and there. You're like a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing the wind in your passion, in your heat. How can I constrain you? Any male pursuing you need not tire themselves. You're real easy. That's exactly what he's saying there. You're she-camel. In your heat, you just run here and there. To all these other lovers, yet if you return, listen to this, yet if you return, this is the mean, angry God of the Old Testament, yet if you return, I will delight in you as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride. and what's really amazing in that text is not just that you can hear the anger of a jealous lover pride the Lord your God I'm a jealous God but you can hear the pain of a lover betrayed for idolatry beloved as spoken of in Exodus chapter 20 the first commandment of the law is not just the breaking of a rule that made God mad because you broke a rule. It is the betrayal of love that has, unbelievably, the power to break the heart of God. I mean, think about it. This is incredible. That the God of creation desired and therefore designed a relationship with His creation wherein the possibility existed for His love to be spurned, to be rejected, to be betrayed. The possibility, God created this possibility for his heart to be broken. Question, why? Why? Why on earth would an all-powerful God put himself in a position like that, allowing himself to be so affected by us? Who are we? Here's why. Because he wanted more than being a potter with a hunk of clay. Because he wanted more than a shepherd with some sheep. And a master with some servants. And a creation with the created. Even more than being a redeemer to the set free. He wanted, what he wanted was a bride. A bride. Who in the context of covenantal love. Covenantal love means I, David, take the Bonnie kind of thing. I promise to have and to hold. In the context of committed covenantal love, which is outlined in the Ten Commandments, that this bride would, with the groom, step into the fullness of her identity and the fullness of her destiny as a person, as the people of God in the world, people who are actually becoming the light of the world, a kingdom of priests, partnering with God for tikkun olam, the healing of the world. But for any of that love stuff, to be real, the possibility had to exist for the bride to reject the groom, to be able to say, I like the redeemer part, I'll praise you, praise you, but this intimates, I don't think so. Yancey describes it this way in his book Disappointment with God that power can do everything but the most important thing it can't control the human heart it can't control love it can't make someone love you in a concentration camp the guards actually possess almost unlimited power and by applying force they can make you do incredible things that you don't want to do that can make you curse your family renounce your God work without pay they can make you eat human excrement, kill and then bury your closest friend. All this is within their power. Only one thing is not. They cannot force you to love them and then by love to serve them. Can't do it. They can force you to serve them, but they can't force you to love them and then by love serve them. This fact may explain, Yancey goes on to say, why sometimes God seems shy to use his power for his most impressive and frightening displays of the same. do nothing to foster love, only compliance. God's problem is not that he's unable to do certain things, it's that he loves. Love has complicated the life of God. See, the reason he didn't make puppets is because he wanted a bride, and that is the God that Jesus knew. And he came to know him in the pages of the Old Testament. And that is the law that Jesus loved. The law that in Jesus' mind, our rabbi's mind, called people to live under the rule and reign of God, thereby stepping into the fullness of their destiny, becoming everything that God ever intended them to be. The law that also says, I want more than a hunk of clay. I want more than a flock of sheep. I want more than obedient slaves. I want a bride with whom I can partner to bring tikkun alam, to heal the world, the fulfillment of our mission together, to have and to hold from this day forward, according to God's holy ordinance, I hereby promise you my faithfulness, no other lovers, no other gods. Final question. You up for that? Because this calls for a lot more than a peck on the cheek and a visit once a week. A weird thought here at the end. And you can add this weird thought to all the other weird thoughts. of this talk. Here's my weird thought. It's actually not too late for a wedding right now. Here. See, all it takes is two words. And this isn't magic wand stuff. This is heart stuff. All it takes is two words. It's kind of words a bride would say to a groom and a groom to a bride. The two words would be this. I do. I will. step into this kind of relationship where we begin this journey together of figuring out what it means to put you first and to accept no substitutes. In fact, when I say I do, when I say I will, what I'm saying I will do is I will begin to submit myself and figure out all the ways I don't even know I'm giving myself to others. I do. I do want this kind of... I will begin to figure out what it means to reverence your name, to observe your day. And the journey with the groom begins, expands. See, the question isn't, does he want you? Does God want me? Golly, Moses. Yes! the question is do you want him do you want him is God for me yes the question is are you for him because what we do is wander away we did it in the garden they did it in Exodus chapter 20 we do it over and over we want a redeemer he wants a bride and so we pray for the spirit of the prophets and the spirit of the psalmist and the spirit of the rabbis who said, oh, how I love these vows. Oh, they make straight my path. They empower me to stay in freedom. They empower me to step into the fullness of my destiny and understand intimacy with God. Would you stand with me as we're dismissed this morning? I'm going to ask anybody in the prayer team here to just make themselves available up front here for anyone who may need prayer because some of you may be in ways that you don't even have words for something in your heart is stirring and you're saying you know what I'm just so ready to say this I do thing I will thing kind of get married today there's another scenario that some of you need to dial into though, and that is this, if you've been married, some of the sweetest things that you ever see happen with married couples is after, you know, maybe 15, 20 years, and they've walked with each other, and they've learned what it meant to really love each other, and maybe had some rocky things. They do this thing called renewing their vows, where they look at each other again and say, I will again. It may be a good day for some of you to renew your vows. Let's pray. Lord, I'm just going to trust that you are able by the power of your Spirit to superintend what's going on in the hearts of men and women here right now. Not only would you be the groom of this wonderful I do, I will thing, but you could at the same time kind of officiate the wedding. I pray that you would just move on every heart here that is saying I will pray that you would in some way in ways that I transcend anything I can even ask for that you would in some ways consummate every heart here that is saying I do maybe for the first time maybe it's a renewal we thank you God for who you are and how you love and who it is you're calling us to be and all God's people said Amen
