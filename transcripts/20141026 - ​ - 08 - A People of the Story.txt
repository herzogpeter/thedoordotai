A chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation. So who are we? It's the question we've been asking for the last couple of weeks. What is the church? Why are we here? Why do we bother? Peter's answer, you just heard it in 1 Peter 2, 9, is that we're a people. A chosen people, actually. a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession who come from a long line of people, which is why I wanted Lisa to read not just 1 Peter 2, but Exodus chapter 6 and chapter 19 and Deuteronomy chapter 6, because we come from a long line of people, all of whom are identified the same way, as a people of God's own possession. A royal priesthood, a holy nation, all of us, all of them, We are two, which means we have an identity as a people, but we also have, and this is very important, a mission. We also have a mission as a people, to be a people through whom God could reveal himself to the world in order to draw all people to himself. For you are the light of the world, said Jesus to his people. He was the light, and now he's saying to his people, you, not you or you or you, but you collectively, We are the light of the world designed to shine in such a way that we, as the people of God, would reveal to the world who God is. And it's a light that will become most visible in the world. Peter Kapsner unpacked this for us last week through things like authentically loving one another, which sounds so soft, but it's amazing because authentic love, rightly ordered love, born of the spirit kind of love, has the power to proclaim. It has the power to make clear. It's a language, actually, that deaf people can hear and blind people can see and children can understand. Indeed, all the law and the prophets are fulfilled in this. Love God, love people, done. Forget seminary. That's all you need to be the kind of light you need to be in the world. So who are we is the question. What is the church? Why are we here? Turns out that's why we're here. Indeed, that's why we keep inviting you into the struggle of becoming fully alive because the more alive, not just you and you and you, but the more alive we become, the brighter the light is that shines from the people of God in any generation designed by God to reveal the true face of God, thus drawing all people to himself. And that is who we are, and that is why we're here, and that is why we talk about a radical commitment to spiritual transformation, because if we are really being formed into the image of Christ, I think you get the point. It becomes more real. The real Christ begins to become apparent, and the real Jesus is actually pretty attractive. Do people see that in his church? Kind of a big question. And all of that is a part of the story that marks the people of God, that God's people have not always understood. And if they understood it, they didn't always remember it. And that's a pretty big thing to not remember, to not understand that we as God's people are part of a much bigger story than our little individual stories, which is why today I want to talk about the story. And that we're a people of the story. When we're trying to figure out who are we, well, let me tell you whatever else we are as a people. We are a people of the story who sometimes need to remember that it's really important to be living in the right story. Let me illustrate that by telling you, you know, a story. Stories actually is a true story. at least the person who told me this story, said it was a true story. So if this is a lie, he lied, not me. Story about a young woman who went to the airport, and when she was waiting for a flight, was informed of a delay, so she goes to the news shop, a little bookstore thing, to buy a magazine and a Kit Kat bar. She returns to the waiting area, finds a seat with a table between her and the other seat, when out of the corner of her eye, she notices the guy in the other, seat across this little table, reaching over to grab her Kit Kat bar and begins casually to eat it. She's mortified by this, doesn't know what to do. Am I on candid camera? She looks around to wonder if she's being kind of brought into some prank when he does it again. He eats another piece, and then another piece. He does it again, noticing all of this. She starts getting angry now, but not wanting to make a scene. She decides to look right at him, kind of stare at him. When he takes, he does it again and takes another piece of this Kit Kat bar. He notices her staring and kind of awkwardly slides half of the Kit Kat bar over to her side of the table. After a few moments of awkward silence, he gets up and leaves, goes to the Cinnabon shop just across the way, and unbeknownst to him, she's right behind him and ready for him. So when he turns around with the Cinnabon thing in his hand, she looks right in his face and takes a huge bite out of that thing. Just in her flight, gets called, perfect timing, I can get out of here, feeling really frisky and not a little self-righteous, a lot self-righteous, she gets in line, reaches into her purse for her boarding pass, only to find her unopened Kit Kat bar. See, she really believed she was in the right story, that she had the right story. She knew what was really going on, but she didn't. She was living in the wrong story. And the point is this, living in the wrong story can sometimes be embarrassing. You end up eating other people's cinnamon buns or something. But sometimes it can be frightening, even dangerous to find out that the things you thought were true and right may not be the way you thought they were. What it means is you've been living in the wrong story if you find something like that out. So what's your story? This is important. What's our story? Seriously, as a church, as a people of God, what is the story that we're living in as a church when it comes to some pretty important stories? What's the story we're living in relative to the story of redemption, the story of the cross, the story of the gospel? What does it mean to be saved? What are you saved from when you think of the gospel? What is it exactly? What is the good news? What's the primary benefit of the good news? Think about that. What's the primary benefit of the good news? For some, not all, but for some, the primary benefit when they think of the good news or they think of the gospel, they think of religion. The primary benefit is heaven when you die. And that becomes the message. And that is one of the benefits of the gospel, the kingdom story. But if that's the only part of the story that you understand, it all gets reduced to getting people to believe the right thing about Jesus for the forgiveness of sin, which is very important. Ultimately, though, so you go to heaven when you die. If you've been around here at our church for any length of time, you know that we've kind of gone through some lengths to try to include that story because that's a very important part of the story. But there's more to the story. So when we talk about eternal life, for instance, we kind of make it a point that we're inviting people, God is inviting people into an eternal kind of life that isn't just heaven when you die. It's about entering by faith in Christ into an eternal kind of life right here and right now. And if you don't know that part of the story, it's not the wrong story, it's just part of the story and you're missing something pretty important in the story. So what's your story relative to that? Let me contrast a couple things here to maybe give you a flavor for this. Billy Sunday, regarded by many as the father of the modern-day evangelistic method. Billy Graham followed kind of the same model, and it's a good one, but it's part of the story if that's the only thing you understand. Billy Sunday used to say this. He's kind of known for saying this. He'd often say this at his crusades, that the best thing that could happen to you tonight would be to come forward after the service to pray this prayer, to sign this card, to go out of here, get in a bus, get hit by a bus, and die, because you'll go to heaven, and that's the good news. He would say that, and it is good news that if you get hit by a bus, or you're in a bus that crashes and you die, it's good news that you're going to heaven, And it's part of the story. It's not the wrong story, but it's just part of the story. And that's his story, that the gospel is primarily about what happens when you die. That's true. It's part of it. But contrast that statement to what Oswald Chambers says. And what he says here includes that other part of the story. But here's what he says. It's not just a question of being saved from hell and going to heaven when you die, but of entering into and experiencing and then manifesting the life of Christ. Stop right there. Manifesting the life of Christ, what does that sound like? That sounds like we've become light because we've entered into the struggle of becoming fully alive in God. When you become fully alive in God, you begin, we begin to shine. Now you're manifesting the life of Christ in our very human lives. And when I hear that statement, I hear a bigger story than it's all about heaven when you die. That's just part of the story. Todd Hunter explains it this way, that with the reductionist rendering of the gospel that kind of entered into evangelical thought about 50 years ago, the gospel got married to the American marketing machine. In other words, something bad happened when the mystery of the gospel got reduced to a bumper sticker, to two or three bullet points that outlined the theory, one theory of atonement. But if you pray the prayer that outlines that theory, you go to heaven when you die, and that reductionist theory is just part of the story. It's not the wrong one. It's just part of it, and it limits us doing actually some, I think, pretty big things, bad things, Among other things, that smaller story robs us of a sense of mission, which is a pretty big thing to miss. Let me illustrate it this way. In fact, I got this from Terry. Terry and I were talking about this last night, walking out the door, and it reminded me of something we used to talk about a lot in trying to explain this. Picture being with a recruiter for military service, being a Marine or somebody in the Army, and there's two sides to that sheet of paper. the recruiter is showing you, and part of what he's selling you on is some really good stuff. You're gonna be part of the few. You will be part of the proud. You're gonna have a really cool uniform, especially in parades. You're gonna be in parades. Did I tell you about that? The benefits are wonderful. We're gonna send you to college if you do your tour for free. We'll send you to college. There's a financial benefit at the end as well. We're gonna teach you a skill. You're gonna have a vocation. A lifetime of benefits in medical care is what you have signed me up. You've got to go to the other side. That's true. That's a part of the story. It's not the whole story. The whole story is this. When you join us, you're going to leave your family and you're going to leave your friends. We're going to shave your hair and make you look like everybody else. And you're going to learn that you're not the center of the story anymore. You're a part of the story. And it's a very big story of which you are a part. But it's not about you is what you're going to learn about this whole thing. And then one day you might go to Afghanistan, and when you're in Afghanistan, you're not going to be thinking about your college deal. Because we need soldiers. This isn't about people who look good in their uniform. That's what we're looking for. I mean, just your picture, I get that. we need people who really understand this is about becoming light so that the world can see who Jesus really is and this becoming is not rhetoric. It's not about people looking good in their uniform. Let me say it this way, kind of a parable, if you will. Imagine being a young kid. Picture him 18 years old. He's right out of college and this kid can play. Just make it baseball. and he's so good he got drafted right out of high school and he got drafted by a storied franchise so it wasn't the Cubs who picked this guy when I think of a storied franchise I think of the New York Yankees and the New York Yankees have legendary players like Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio, Derek Jeter, Murano, other guys too and when you go to Yankee Stadium You can go to center field and you can see the plaques of their names. You can see their faces there. You see the sign that says, this is the house that Ruth built. This is the house that Babe Ruth built. You're in Yankee Stadium. Imagine now, 18 years old, walking into the clubhouse for the very first time. And you feel, you feel the presence of those old players. And you also feel the reality of the present players. because Derek Jeter is, there's that guy. Whoa, he's right over there in the flesh. Think you'd be thrilled? 18 years old, right out of high school. Think you'd be intimidated maybe a little bit, maybe a lot. Absolutely. In fact, if you weren't intimidated, you probably don't know where you are. And the wise old coach then, seeing the look in your eye, because you're wondering if you belong in this place, walks over to you and puts his tired, bony arm around you and says, boy, I know this can be a bit much because this is a storied franchise, but you belong on that field. We drafted you high. You have the right stuff, so get out there and play. Which, you guys, it's actually what I think Paul is doing. in places like Ephesians chapter 1 when he says to some fresh young recruits who lived in Ephesus, you can play this game and you just need to know you were drafted high. Indeed, before God created the world, before God created the world, before the foundations of the world, he chose you to be in him. Ephesians 1, 4, for you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world which means you were drafted high, which means you belong on this field, which means you have the right stuff for God has granted to you and me and us everything we need for life and godliness. 2 Peter 1.3. So get out there and play and to your faith add moral excellence and to your faith add knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness and kindness and love. how many of you have an awareness that when you said yes to God and opened your heart wide to faith in Christ that you were being called into a storied franchise with legendary players like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob like Deborah, Esther, and Ruth like Peter, and Paul, and Jesus himself who played this game like nobody else. He could play. And then Jesus showed us how to play this game called life, and then he called us to do the same, and then he said, I'll show you how. I'll send my spirits and help you. So walk into that clubhouse. How would you feel? Would you be thrilled to be in the company of such people? Would you be intimidated a little bit? Good. Good. That means you're maybe in the story. It means you maybe get it. Remember Moses? You kind of do. You remember that he, I'm going to stretch these athletic metaphors beyond credulity here, but remember he spent his whole rookie year, sorry. He spent his whole rookie year sitting on the bench, pouting on the bench, because when God said, you do have the right stuff, I'm calling you to go there. He said, who am I? I can't. Shut up. It's not about who you are, Moses. It's about who I am, and I am with you, so go. It took him a while to get that. But actually, you know what it means? It took him a while to get it, enter into it. It means he understood the story. It means that because it scared them. If it don't scare you, I don't think you'd get the story. You know, I didn't story. The story he was being called into was bigger than pray the prayer, go to heaven when you die. Pray the prayer, go to heaven when you die. But that's just part of the story. Moses at least had the sense to be scared because he knew the story. So what's our story? Are you bored? It's so boring. Oh, God. well all I can say is honestly you're in the wrong you're in the wrong story now intimidated, scared wondering if you have I know how to help you there I get that it just means you're in the story one of the things we talk about here is the picture of the church as being more like a locker room and this works here for me the church being more like a locker room and it is a cathedral. And the thing that strikes me about being a locker room, as we've said before, is this, that the locker room is not where you play the game. We don't play it here. It's where you prepare for the game and heal up from the game. It's where you regroup and remember how to play the game and why we play the game. But the game of shining as lights, if you will, is out there. The real ministry is not in here. I'm in the ministry, and it's not in here. It's out there, and whatever is in here is preparing us for there. We're not doing the kingdom when we go to church. We're doing the kingdom when we learn how to love a flawed human being, like our husband, our wife. We're doing the kingdom when we learn how to love our neighbor. Our neighbors don't care that we're in church. We don't get any points. But they get affected when we love them. It's weird how that works. and this application of this analogy keeps expanding in my mind I've been in a lot of locker rooms sometimes even professional ones were professional athletes and among the things that I remember about those things as well as being a little intimidated for sure but this is weird because this can't be I remember at times in those locker rooms even with professional athletes being struck by up close how ordinary they look I'm shorter than me they just look like regular people like real people when I watch them play however they're bigger than life wow I see my TV it's like are they in the same race as I am it's just weird they come in the locker room having played the game where they look bigger than life but they come in the locker room and you know what they look like ordinary they look tired and sweaty dirty and bloody they look happy and sad they look elated and discouraged. Sometimes they get injured, have to get carried off the field, and then they wonder if they'll ever play again. The point is this, in the flow of everything, they're a lot more regular than you know. But sometimes in church we get that wrong. In fact, it ends up being the opposite where we didn't play the game very well at all. out there, don't really even care about learning what it means to love our wife or our husband or ordinary people or our neighbors or having a light shine through our life that is authentically becoming more about Christ. That's not even on our radar screen, so we don't play at all, actually, out there. But when we come here, we put it all on. And when people come to church, we put our little military uniform on, don't I look good? You look like an idiot, actually. Imagine being part of a team where somebody didn't really play, didn't want to play, wasn't giving themselves to the team, wasn't entering into the stuff you do, the workouts, and when they played, it was half-hearted, but you come in the locker room, get, go away, please, leave. Everybody's dressed up, everybody looks good. but if we're in a different story a bigger story you come into the locker room a different way probably the way that many of you are here today just the way you are so you come to the locker room maybe tired sweaty, dirty, bloody, happy sad, elated, discouraged sometimes injured wondering if you'll ever play the game again, you're sitting in the dark hoping nobody even sees you here today. You don't even feel like you're part of the team actually today. But you come into the locker room the way you are. You know why? Because this isn't where we play. In fact, you'll look stupid if you start showing off here. This is where we prepare to play. This is where we regroup and remember who we are and how we play and why we play. And this is where we come to heal so we can get back in the game. And that's our story. That's who we are. That's why we're here. One final word about being a storied franchise. If you play for the Yankees, one of the things that the Yankees will make very clear to you real quick, I think, is that there's a certain way to play the game. Twins have been kind of known for that, the Minnesota Twins. There's a Twins way to play, very clear on the fundamentals. And if you're a Yankee, there's a way we play the game. And they may not say this, but it's going to become real clear to you that we're not playing for the Chicago Cubs anymore. We're playing for the New York Yankees. And because we're playing for the New York Yankees, we play in the manner of Ruth. We play a certain way. We play in the manner of Garrigan, Mantle, and DiMaggio. We play in this franchise. We play in the way of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. We play in the manner of Joseph and Deborah, Esther, and Ruth, Peter, and James, and John, and think about how they played. Did they play perfect? No, they didn't. Moses had a huge issue with his anger most of his life till the end. He kind of softened a bit. Abraham had a problem waiting for God for the promise coming through Sarah, so he went into Hagar. Didn't always play it perfect, but boy, could they play. And by play, I don't mean perform. When I say they could play, Moses, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Ruth, Esther, Deborah, I mean, boy, could they believe they believed. So much that they went to a land they didn't know. And when I say they could play, what I mean is they obeyed. What I mean is they followed God and they didn't do it pretty. They just didn't do it pretty. But they could play. Okay. and that's our story that's who we are that's why we're here and it's not just you being a player it's we are the light of the world living stones remember that a couple weeks ago living stones who as we individually grow are being fitted together with other living stones that is creating this temple this dwelling of God that creates more and more room for the dwelling of God and the moving of God and the revelation of God even to the world. And this is who we are and this is why we're here. This is why we invite people into the struggle of becoming fully alive because the more alive we become, the brighter the light is shining and clearer the face of Jesus becomes in the world. so what's your story? Let's pray as we're dismissed. Would you stand with me? Close. This thing just came into my mind. Just now. I was talking about this analogy of they didn't get it right all the time. If you're a baseball player and you hit 300, I think that's three hits out of every 10 times, so you strike out a lot, which means you didn't play it perfect. You hit 300, you're in the Hall of Fame. It didn't play it perfect. If you hit 260, you're not so good. It occurs to me that some are in the game, really in the game and not playing very well. And you're not sure you even belong in the game. And some of you probably need prayer. Some of you probably need healing. To know you belong in the game. To know you can get back in the game. And so there will be people here to pray for you. Maybe you can sit with some people you're with right now. And do that if you'd have the courage to just say, I'm injured. I got a limp. And I want to get back in the game somehow. Somehow. So Holy Spirit come. Upon us. Because this is a we. Heal your church. Heal your people. If my people. Call on my name. Will call on my name. Humble themselves. humble themselves I'll heal I'll heal them I'll fill them use them God help us to enter into the whole story your story to which we have been called as your chosen people for once we were not a people but now we are the people of God and all God's people said Amen God bless you as you leave you're dismissed come for prayer if you need it see you later you
