Good morning, I'm Jim Powers. And I'm Game Powers. Today's scripture reading for this first week of Advent comes from Isaiah 64, Psalm 80, and Mark 13. Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains would tremble before you, as when fire sets twigs ablaze and causes water to boil. Come down to make your name known to your enemies, and cause the nations to quake before you. For we have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind, our sin sweeps us away. No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you, for you have hidden your face from us and have given us over to our sins. Yet you, Lord, are our Father. We are the clay. You are the potter. We are all the work of your hand. So hear us, shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock, you who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Awaken your might. Come and save us. Restore us, O God. Make your face shine on us that we may be saved. Then we will not turn away from you. Revive us and we will call on your name. Restore us, Lord God Almighty. Make your face shine on us that we may be saved. And then one day we will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. But of that day and hour no one knows. So be aware, stay alert, keep awake. And what I say to you, I say to all, keep awake. For this is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Thank you. Some of you know, I'm guessing many of you don't, that those scriptures we just read for Advent come from the lectionary. And some of you know because you've been following with us in the lectionary. The way the lectionary works is the scriptures of the week. You read them into the weekend and some of you began. And if you were doing the lectionary, you've been reading those scriptures all week long. And now today I'm going to preach on it. And we've done this before without you always knowing it. We've kind of preached through the lectionary, sometimes for Lent. I think we did it last year also for Advent. But we didn't invite you into it all the time. We didn't know how to do that actually. But we are this year. And some of you accepted the invitation last week. But we would like you to do it this week. Again, you can get on our website actually. And you'll see the thing just like that. Click on that when you see that little picture. Click on that and you'll see the place where you can click on to the scriptures of the week. And you will begin tomorrow to begin the scriptures that we will be preaching on next Sunday. So you read into the weekend. And we've been talking a lot about becoming a people. Because we are a people. God's chosen people. His own possession. And it's something good to do as a people. To be in these scriptures and then move into the weekend with all of these things in mind. Some of the scriptures will confuse you. What are that one doing there? I mean, this Mark 13 passage where the Son of Man is coming in the cloud sounds like an end times thing. Why are we doing that at Advent? Good question. I'm answering it. Anyway. Let's pray as we begin. Father, we pray for the work of your Spirit to continue among us. Keep our hearts open and receptive to the things you'd have to say to us and call us to in Jesus' name. Amen. Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel. Awaken your might and save us. Stir up your strength is what that means. Come down to us. Rend the heavens. Break open, rip open heaven and come down to us. Restore us, revive us. Make your face to shine upon us and save us is the language of Advent. And the language of Advent is the language of longing for things to be better or different or whole. So restore us, revive us, because things aren't the way they're supposed to be. Revive us, make your face to shine upon us. But the language of Advent is also the language of waiting for what we're longing for. It's the language of longing, but you're going to have to wait for that thing you long for. It's the language of waiting and watching and believing, even though you're not seeing, at least right now, which means that the language of Advent is the language of living in that place between what you've been hoping for and that hope of being fulfilled. The language of Advent is the language of living in that place between the promises of God or what you thought were the promises of God and those promises being fulfilled. And when you're in that place between, and we're in that place a lot, in fact, in some ways we're in that place between our whole lives, all you can do is wait for the fulfillment of everything you've hoped for and dreamt for, all the promises of God to be made visible and real. so all you can do is wait i'm not good at waiting and i know that is a surprise to you uh but i'm not when we go to a restaurant it's kind of a family joke and we're told it'll be about an hour i'm thinking that's code language for uh you need to go somewhere else to eat because that's what i do um i actually i think that's code language when they tell you it's an hour wait it's code language for why didn't you make a reservation idiot and that's what that is seriously i really am that guy at the grocery store, always looking for the shortest line, and I think it was going to be the fastest line, and I'm always wrong. I really am. It drives me crazy, because I think this stuff out. I check it through. I'm watching what's going on in each line. That cart there is a little fuller. It's going to take longer. That register person there looks a little sleepy. She's going to be slow. He's going to be faster. I'm thinking about this stuff, and so I jump into the line that looks shorter. and I'm actually winning. And then I see the thing on her little vest or whatever it is, cashier in training. Sure, of course you are in training. And I'm not going to win again today. A couple weeks ago, it's a true story. It's not a happy story. It's a sad story. I wanted a bag of nuts. It's all I wanted for a snack. It was later in the evening. And so I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to run to the store. Bonnie says, that's great, but go to this store. It's a little cheaper for nuts. Who cares? Okay, I'll do it. A bottle of water. Get some water as well. it's on sale at this particular store. I can already feel things slowing down when she's giving me all this stuff, but I'm going, so I do go thinking it's going to be quick, but it's not quick. Of course, it's not quick. One register is open. That's all that's open. There's more people there than should be there at that time of night, and one register is open. I'm thinking, what are they thinking? I'm thinking, what are they thinking? Don't they know I'm here? But there's nothing I can do, and I'm really pretty formed in this stuff, and I kind of hear the message in my own brain, just slow down, just take it easy, all you got to do is wait, just wait. So I wait, and I wait, because there's just one register, and I'm not near the front, and then I hear this voice, it's the voice of God saying that register two is now going to open, and I'm going, thank you, Jesus. So I make my move, I'm second in line, this is good, but there's nobody there. It's open, the light is on, but there's nobody at the cash register, so I wait. And I wait, and I'm still doing pretty good. And then I saw her, it was obviously an employee of the store, and she's walking toward the checkout line. She's obviously going to be our cashier, and she walks right by the aisle. I had to talk to the cashier at the first aisle, and I'm like, okay, they must be friends. And apparently, they were really good friends, because they were apparently catching up. I don't know what's going on. And I'm waiting, and I'm doing all I can do to wait, and I'm waiting, and I wait some more. And then she's done with her conversation, walks toward my cash register, and then she walks out the door, and I wait, and I wait, and I wait. No more. Actually, I left my cart full of the nuts and the water. I left it right there in aisle two. It's probably still there. I just walked away. I didn't make a scene. You would have been proud of me. I didn't mumble under my breath. I didn't roll my eyes. While being neglected, I uttered no threats, just like Jesus. It was incredible. And then I went to Sam's Club to get my bag of nuts and water. And guess what I did there? You guessed it. I waited and waited and waited some more. All of this to the absolute delight of my wife, who, when I told her this, broke into a great smile because she sees things like this as proof that there really is a God and he's on her side. It's just a silly thing. But it's a telling thing. It really is because here's the truth about me and it's the truth about you. I want what I want when I want it. And waiting, without any noise, says, can't have it. You can't have what you want when you want it, at least not yet. You'll just have to wait, just like, by the way, just like everybody else. Which means at least two things. And these two things are telling as well. The first thing it means is this, you're not that important. I love hearing that message. Because the doctor is going to see you when he or she is ready to see you. Second message, very telling, is this. You're not in control because the cashier is going to ring you up when it's your turn. So you'll just have to wait like everybody else, which puts my silly little grocery story into a slightly different light. At least it does for me, and it's maybe not as cute. Because when I left my cart and walked out the door that day, I was basically saying, want to bet? I have to wait? Want to bet? Just watch. Because I don't have to wait. I'm leaving. I will not wait. I'm not like everybody else, like those losers who are still in line. They're probably still there. Two weeks later, looking, what is going on? I won't be controlled. You can't control me. I'm leaving my cart. Passive-aggressive, a little bit. I don't know. I took psychology in college. That's what they call it. Actually, kind of frightening, don't you think? Because I'm the pastor. This is great. But here's the deal. You know it's true at the grocery store. You can get away with that stuff. Because at the grocery store, you don't have to wait. You can just get up and leave. You can be in that kind of control. But sometimes, and you know this is true as well, and so do I, you can't get up and leave. You can't just be in control. though you might continue to pretend you are because sometimes something happens that's just a little bit bigger, something that this time you can't control and you can't fix, and now you have to wait. And now you have to wait like everybody else, which means you just got a gift. I mean, it doesn't feel like a gift, but you just got a gift, and it's just in time for Christmas. But it's not the kind of gift we normally welcome or want because the gift you got was this. You got de-centered. We live our lives as if we are the center. We don't know we do it. I do it. It's a picture, a circle. You're right in the center. And as long as you are in the center, it kind of feels good. You feel secure. You're in control. You never grow there, by the way. Nothing ever changes for you. You never are transformed in that place. And then you get a gift. You are de-centered. You're no longer the center of the universe. You thought you were. You're no longer in control. This gift you got actually was a revelation, and the revelation was you're not the center. You thought you were. You're not. And the revelation is you're not in control. You thought you were. You wanted to be. And so do I, but now you're actually entering into, when you feel those experiences of being de-centered, you're not the center of the universe. You're not that important. You are actually entering into now what Advent really is. you're entering into that spirit of Advent. And it's a lot different than what we call the Christmas spirit because it's a fascinating paradox what Advent really is and what we're kind of gearing up for when it comes to Christmas spirit. It's a totally different dynamic because this time when you're actually entering into an Advent kind of experience that's authentic, what the Advent experience tells you is this, you have to wait because this time you have no control because this time you can't fix it. just by pitching a fit. This time you can't fix it just by leaving your cart in the proverbial aisle at the grocery store because Advent isn't just a date on the calendar for weeks before Christmas. Advent is that place between all the things I've been hoping for but not yet fulfilled. It's that place between the promises of God and the fulfillment of that promise and the place between is that place where you have to wait you have no choice and that's not usually a place we want to go or would willingly go but it's not an elective course I think you know this too on this journey we call life particularly on this journey we call the spiritual life or the life in the kingdom of God life where we want to grow and become who God's called us to be and who God's designed us to be, which is why Richard Rohr says what he says in his book Adam's Return when he says, kind of matter-of-factly, and I love how he says this because it's kind of a like it or not, this is true, that nothing fresh or creative will ever really happen when we're still in control, when we're still insulated and isolated from our self-constructed comfort zones. Nothing original ever emerges from business as usual because you think what you always thought, you believe what you've always believed, and you are who you've always been. How thrilling, how boring, really. Nothing ever original or new, creative or fresh. Nothing transforming ever takes place when you're still in control and then you get a gift. It doesn't feel like a gift, but the gift is this, you get de-centered. Sometimes just by life, life will do that to you. Often it's by something difficult or disturbing, something sudden or disruptive, but not always. There's some very positive things that can de-center us in very healthy ways. The birth of a child can do it. When a woman experiences something like that for the first time, maybe for the first time in their life, they're experiencing something. They don't have these words, but her center is no longer herself. It's this child. It's a de-centering. It's a transcendent experience. It doesn't always last very long because they start crying pretty soon. And worship, authentic God experience can de-center you as well in a very healthy way. You're not the center. God's really the center. Transcendent worship where for a moment in the context of even corporate worship, we really get this sense, I'm not the point. God, wow, we really are. God is the center of this. Those positive things are wonderful. They can be de-centering and transforming, but they don't always last long because by the end of that very same worship service, you're going, why do they sing that song? They sing it too loud. They sing it too soft. They sing it too slow. And all of a sudden, you're the center again because you're the critic. Now you're the center again. This is the universe. It's back to normal, which is why most of the de-centering things that actually work are difficult things. Disruptive things like the death of a loved one or the death of a marriage, the death of a dream, or the loss of a job or your health, some kind of suffering that you can't fix this time, that you can't control this time simply by leaving your cart at the grocery store aisle. You've been de-centered. You're in that place between what you'd been hoping for and the fulfillment of that hope. And in this place, all you can do is wait, and it drives us crazy to wait. But it's from that place of decenteredness that the language of Advent begins to emerge. What I would call the songs of Advent begin to be sung, and even the tone of worship today, I don't know if you noticed it, but it was powerful and hopeful, but there was a melancholy flavor to the whole thing. The songs of Advent, and the language of Advent, is the language and song of longing. Longing for things to be better. For things to be, I don't know, different. I just wish it was different in our marriage. I wish it was different in our church or school or my job or the world. I wish it was whole, which is, by the way, the longing of every human heart. And it has been since the beginning of time. Isaiah talked this way. The psalmist talked this way. And so we say, restore us. Isaiah, the prophet said that. Revive us. Come down to us and save us, said Isaiah the prophet and the psalmist as well. Because we can't fix it this time, God. So all we can do is wait. For what? What is it that we're waiting for? Matthew 13, 26 is the answer to that. That was the third scripture in the lectionary reading. You can see it on the screen. This is what we're waiting for, the Son of Man. This is what we want. Come down. And we're waiting for the Son of Man to come through the clouds with great power and glory. That is what we're waiting for. Think about it because it's the Son of Man who will restore us and revive us, come down to us and save us. But it is weird. I mentioned this at the beginning. What's that passage doing in Advent? That's an end times passage. That's the second coming of Christ at the end of the age. This is Advent. That was the first coming of Christ. So what does this have to do with Advent? What does this mean? Here's what it means, and this is powerful, I think, what it means that they would put that text in this Advent place. It means this, that the people of God in every single age, from the beginning of time, need to do what the people of God in every age have needed to do, beginning with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, Moses, Joshua, Isaiah, the psalmist, Mary and Joseph, us two, including. And they'll be needing to do this at the end of the age, right up to that final day when the Son of Man finally actually does come through the clouds with great power and glory. Even then, from the beginning to the end, God's people need to learn how to wait. And I hate waiting. To be aware and awake. Don't go to sleep. Stay awake, therefore, Mark 13, 35, and wait. Here's the key. For God to deliver. Because you can't fix it this time. So you have to wait for God this time to provide because you can't provide this time. Wait for God to move and wait for God to heal and restore because you can't fix this one. You can't. You tried, quit trying, shut up. You need to learn to wait and let God revive, let God lead and guide, come down to us and save us, and that's the invitation of Advent. When you feel those things, you're experiencing Advent, but it's more than an invitation. This is the discipline of Advent. Because this waiting thing is part of the deal that we call life. Indeed, the first Advent story. Go back to the first one. all the characters, Mary and Joseph, all these people. That first Advent scene story is full of people waiting in that place between what they were hoping for and the fulfillment of that hope because there's Elizabeth. Remember her, there she is waiting for a child to be born, but it isn't her child she's waiting for, and she's in that place between what she's hoping for because it isn't quite there yet, and Zechariah is waiting too. He's waiting for his speech to return, but he's wondering, is my speech ever going to return? He's not sure about that. Simeon is waiting to see the Lord's Christ, that an angel told him he would see before he died. Was it an angel who told me that, or was it the pizza the night before? I thought an angel told me I would see the Lord's Christ, so he is in that place between what he thought was the promise of God, what he was hoping for in the fulfillment of that promise. Israel, all of Israel on that first advent is waiting. For what? For God's promised prophets. They're waiting for Messiah. They've been waiting for years. They've been hearing, they've been crying this cry. They've been praying this prayer. Hear us, O God, O shepherd of Israel. Come down to us with your promised prophet Messiah. So they're in that place between. And Mary, pregnant with Jesus, is waiting for what will come of this life in her. It's growing in her. The angel said to her he would be great. So I'm expecting great. A light to the Gentiles is who he will be in the glory of God's people. Israel and all of them are waiting every single one in that place between what they were hoping for and the fulfillment of that hope. And when you're in that place, all you can do is wait because you can't fix this one. You don't know the answer. The ancients had a word for this, called it liminal space. The word liminal is Latin and it means thresholds. They actually had come to reverence this thing they called liminal space. They considered it sacred space because it was a space, it was a place in your life where you were decentered, but that was the place they knew you could be transformed. It comes again from this word meaning threshold because when you cross a threshold, you're crossing over into something. You're moving from, literally in a threshold deal, you're moving from one room to the next, but the threshold itself is that place between one room and the other where you've left one room, let's say it a different way, where you've left one way of being, one way of living, all the securities that you knew in that room, but it was a confining room, so you either chose to leave or you're kind of getting pushed out of this place. You've left one room, one security, and you haven't quite entered the next. The threshold is that place where you've left, and so that's kind of scary because that was secure, but you're not at the new yet, so I don't have any secure. I'm at this threshold. I'm in this place. Between, it's called liminal space, where what you've always known is no longer what you know you've left, how you always thought and how you've always been, but you haven't fully entered the news, so you're again in that place. Between, where all you can do is wait and wonder and listen and pray, and it's not an easy place to be. because we hate waiting. But I don't care if you're good at waiting or not. It's not an easy place to be. It's an unfamiliar place. It's unsettling. It's a place of not knowing, which means it's a place that we humans don't want to go, don't want to be. But it's a place, says Richard Rohr again, that the biblical God is always bringing his people. Indeed, much of the work of the biblical God and human destiny itself is to get people into that kind of space, this liminal space, and then to keep them there long enough. I hate this. And then to keep them there long enough so as to learn something essential, something genuinely new. But there's the rub, isn't it? Because we need to stay there long enough to learn something essential and genuinely new, but we don't wait well. And we all know that. In part because we refuse to, like I did in that grocery store. You just can't make me stay here. I refuse to wait. But in part, because we don't have to most of the time wait, just like me at the grocery store. I don't have to wait. We can just turn up to volume. You can just leave the shopping cart in the aisle, which allows you to live, by the way, when you just turn up to volume. It's an incredible picture of people who just make it noisier. I know, I know, just make it noisier, which allows us to live at that place on the outer edges of our life, at the circumference of our lives. Then we begin when we're living out there in these thin places, disconnected from our own heart. We confuse these centrifugal, these circumference experiences out here with actual life. Now I have to have my headphones on all the time, Because this is all there is. It's just noise and it's empty. Disconnected from yourself, which is why the poor in some cultures, says Roar, earlier peoples, before all our technology, had an advantage over us when it comes to soul work. They don't have as many escapes from the soul work that we can avoid. Because they have to stay in it. There is no easy way out. There is no instant fix, no pill to swallow. no vacation to take, no new car to buy. They have to stay there long enough to learn something essential. We, on the other hand, can live on the circumference of our lives for quite a long time, so long, in fact, that we can begin to believe it's the only life that's there. Parker Palmer, in his book, The Hidden Wholeness, points out that Jesus fasted for 40 days. And I've never heard this before, but it was a fascinating thing. It says he fasted 40 days and then he was hungry. It says in Matthew 3, verse 2, suggesting did Parker Palmer that that's how long it takes to get in touch with our longings, with our true hungers, 40 days. Whoa. Who would do that? Are you kidding? I'm taking a pill. I'm going on vacation. Who would do that? Who would wait that long? Well, I don't know the answer to that question, But what I do know is this, whether I like it or not, this is the invitation of Advent. And it's crazy, I think. Fascinating, actually, that as we enter into this season of Christmas that is notorious for turning up the volume and moving us to frenzy, the invitation, the actual invitation of this season is to wait. In that place between what you've been hoping for and the fulfillment of that hope and in that place between, that place is a place of longing. For things to be better or different. I just wish they were different. At my job and my marriage, I just wish it was different or whole. So hear us, O Shepherd of Israel. This has been the cry of God's people for millennia. Hear us, O shepherd of Israel. This is the cry of every human heart, whether they know it or not. You who lead Joseph like a flock, you who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth. God, we pray before Benjamin and Ephraim and Manasseh, but even more that you would tear open the heavens and come down is what we pray and save us. And here's the good news. you just need to know he has, he has come down. He has come down indeed. Having humbled himself, Philippians 2.17, he took the very nature of a servant, to what we talk about at Advent, and being made in the likeness of men, he has come down in the form of a baby boy. He has come down and he will again, you need to get your hopes up around this, he will again come down. And when he does, we will see. And what we will see is this, the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. So stay awake, church, and be alert, be aware, because we will see. But until then, we live in this place. That all of God's people have lived in from the beginning, in that place between, and from that place we wait and watch and pray and cry out, Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel. for our marriages and our families and our neighborhoods and our schools. Come down to us. Restore us. Revive us, we pray. Make your face to shine upon us and save us. Let me close with a question. What is it for you? What is it for you that you can't fix? What is your longing? It's weird about our longings because some of us don't have easy access. We don't know what they are. Others, you're so aware of them, you are really having a hard time not weeping right now because you know. But here would be my question, do you know? In that place between, can you name it? In that place between, which is where we are, can you identify it? could you maybe right now bring it to God? Could you share it with a friend? In closing right here in this space, I want to provide some silence for us to ask God about that. What is my longing? That place I'm in between. I'm going to say something that sounds like a prayer and then I'll be quiet and then I'll say some other things that sound like a prayer and be quiet. If you'd like, you can close your eyes. However it is that you would enter into prayer, find a comfortable position, put your hands in a comfortable place. Silently. How silently the wondrous gift was given. I would be silent now, Lord. Right now in this place, I would be silent. and expectant that even now, even here, I might receive the gift I need so I may become the gift that others need. Oh, holy God, even in this silence, I become aware there are dark places in my life. And in my world. And there are places I want to avoid. Places that I feel quite hopeless about. I wonder, what would you want to form in me? What new birth do you have in mind for me? Give me courage, Lord. Give us courage, Lord. not only to wait for you in these hard places but to be alert with expectation to be alive with hope that your light will soon come and that something new is on the way that something new is on the way. and all God's people said amen would you stand with me as we close for all of us Father who are in this place between what we've been hoping for and hope fulfilled. We pray your grace, your mercy, your life. Rend the heavens and come down. Restore us, revive us, save us. We pray. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. There will be people here who need prayer. God bless you as you leave. You're dismissed. - Thank you.
