If you open your Bibles with me to the book of Matthew, chapter 5. In our continuing study of the book of Matthew, we are in our continuing study of the Sermon on the Mount. Focusing today on verse 9. If you've been with us at all these last few weeks, you are aware of the fact that the Sermon on the Mount really began in chapter 4. The kingdom of God was introduced in verse 17 when Jesus came and said these words, repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand the kingdom has come the reign of god but that kingdom was not just something to be talked about or looked at it was a it was a kingdom that had power and authority and it wasn't the power and authority that you just talked about either because that power was demonstrated in verse 23 when he went about in all galilee teaching in the synagogues proclaiming the reign of god had come but also demonstrating that by healing disease and casting out demons. And then the news of the spread, the kingdom spread throughout all of Syria and Galilee and people began to come. And when he saw the people coming, he knew that some of them were coming for the wrong reasons. And so he kind of backs off. And we read these words that we've been dealing with in Matthew chapter 5, verse 1. When he saw the multitudes, he went up on the mountain. And after he sat down, his disciples came to him, his followers, not just the 12. And opening his mouth he began to teach them saying basically this these are the people who really are part of the kingdom it isn't just the people who are looking for the power and wanting to see all the razzle dazzle and it isn't the religious elite the religious elite that you have come to use as your definition of what spirituality is blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are those who mourn over their sin and get out here what is in here for they alone shall be comforted. Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they alone shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God. Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when men cast insults at you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely on account of me. Rejoice and be glad for your reward in heaven is great because they did the same thing to the prophets who went before you. You are the salt of the earth. Let's pray. God, I sense your spirit upon me in a strong way today and I also sense a warfare in a strong way today. I don't think that Satan likes what's going on here and I don't think he likes the truth that is being presented that sets people free. And in Jesus' name we ask that the power of your spirit would reign supreme and that we would hear this morning as it were the very oracles of God. And I ask this in the name of Jesus and by his authority. Amen. blessed are the peacemakers there's something in the heart of man that aches for peace that sense of inner settledness a quiet confidence a sense of security but the problem is is that while there's an ache for that there's also an awareness that very often we don't have a sense of inner confidence of inner settledness of a sense of security the lack of peace in our lives is something I believe that in any context, wherever you are, if you sense a lack of peace, it's something that somehow grates on the human psyche. If you go into a group of people and there's kind of a good spirit and a good feeling and all of a sudden someone interjects something that is hostile, it grates on your spirit, you shrink back, you kind of shrivel up. If you're in a home and there is a consistent lack of peace, there is something about your psyche that we could say of it, it is shriveled up. It grates against us, we ache for peace. a lack of it wears us down it saps our strength it drains our life but on the global level we don't see peace we watch with naive hope as people superpowers come together and we believe that maybe something can come of it to bring peace but it never does really happen even if they do sign a treaty nobody ever keeps it on a local level we watch the news and hear the numbing statistics of theft and murder and rape and abuse of children and adults, families that can't stay together, it's almost become something we just accept, that relationships get shattered. They come together and even when people come together, they anticipate the time when that relationship will be shattered. There is no peace, a sense of unrest. But you know, I can talk about the global level and the local level, but most of us don't have to go any further than our own heart to understand the reality of annoying, unsettling unrest, a lack of peace. And men cry, peace, peace, but there is no peace. And that's kind of scary. And there are things that people do to deal with the lack of unrest in their spirits, the lack of peace that they feel. And some people lose themselves in their work, and they get all involved in that. And sometimes that's because they're so full of energy, but sometimes the reason they do it is kind of in an effort to somehow medicate The numbing, gnawing sense of unrest that they feel. It's almost a running. Some people absorb themselves and lose themselves in things that they acquire for themselves. And it even works for a moment. When you buy the new car, you kind of forget, but you've got to come back to yourself. And that gnawing sense of unrest returns. And some people involve themselves in doing things. And other people protect themselves with silence. You see the way they maintain the peace in their home is they just never bring up any issues that will cause any unrest, and they ignore problems, and they just kind of hope they go away, and they call that peace, but the gnawing continues inside their spirit. And some people medicate the lack of rest with drugs and alcohol, and some people remove the sense of unrest with a bullet to the brain. Men cry, peace, peace, but there is no peace. And into that kind of gnawing unrest, the kingdom has come. and Jesus took the book of the prophet Isaiah that was handed to him in the temple and he said this I got good news folks those of you who have a gnawing sense of unrest the spirit of the Lord is on me and he has anointed me to preach the good news of the gospel of peace and he has sent me to proclaim release to captive people who are in bondage to sin and he has called me to proclaim recovery of sight to the blind and to set free those who are under it and to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord, that is this, forgiveness of sin. The Prince of Peace came into the world to answer one of the fundamental issues of human life, annoying sense of unrest. And the people to whom we have been learning these last weeks, the people to whom this peace of God comes the people to whom the prince comes and delivers this peace that we so need. We have been learning the last few weeks are not the religious and the perfect and the well put together and the ones who look so good. This peace that the prince has come to give is coming to those who are broken and recognize they need a prince of peace. And it's coming to those who mourned over their sin. And it's coming to those who are hungering and thirsting for a righteousness that is not their own. and is coming to those who have been given by the Spirit of God a brand new heart that yearns for real righteousness. Those are the people to whom this peace is coming. And those are the people through whom that peace will flow. I want you to notice something about the text. I'm talking about peace in my introduction here, but it doesn't say in our text in verse 9, blessed are those who have peace. It says this, blessed are those who bring peace. Blessed are those who are peacemakers, peace bringers, people who are moving into churches and relationships and moving to Michigan and moving to Pennsylvania and what they're bringing with them when they go is the peace of God, the kingdom of God. Something is assumed when we come to verse 9 that we need to understand and that is this, that the people he is calling to be peacemakers are the people who have been broken and they are mourning and they're hungering for a righteousness that is not their own and the righteousness that they have received from Christ by faith is now flowing through them. And they are pure in heart people. They are people to whom peace has come. And now he's looking at those people, kingdom people, and he's saying this, I want you to take the peace that God has given to you and bring it everywhere you go. Be a peace bringer. Be a grace giver. Be a forgiveness of God declarer. Everywhere you go, blessed are the peacemakers. They are the sons of God. You want to know a peacemaker? You want to know a son of God? there are people who are bringing grace. There are people who are bringing forgiveness. There are people who are bringing the reign of God to the world. Those are the sons of God. But what is a peacemaker? I'm going to break our study down into three parts, three aspects of what it means to be a peacemaker. The first part is this, it's perversion. It's perversion. I think we have some fuzzy ideas about what it means to be a peacemaker, and I want to straighten those out. The second part is going to be its enemy. the enemies to peace in your life and in mine. And then the third part very quickly will be the call to be a peacemaker. First of all, the perversion of what it means to be a peacemaker. As I said just a moment ago, the reason I bring this up is I think we have a lot of fuzzy ideas about what it means. What is a peacemaker? Don't even think of what you think it ought to mean. Think of how it is in terms of your functioning in your life and in your family. The peacemaker in your family is the person who does what? Maybe you are that peacemaker. The peacemaker very often in our minds is that person in our family or at work or at church or in the circle of friends who is responsible to keep the peace. That's a very nice endeavor. That's a very nice ambition to keep the peace. The problem is this. Very often our impression of what it means to be a peacemaker issues in a lifestyle that basically says this. The way I keep the peace is I ignore problems and I change the subject. You ever do that in conversations where you're with the family and everything is going great and you know that daddy is really upset about some certain thing, so kids don't bring that thing up. And so the peacemaker's job is to make sure nobody ever brings up a subject that's going to upset daddy. Even if it's something that needs to be talked about, we don't talk about that, and then we'll just make sure everything's okay and we'll call that peace. Certain things aren't talked about because it creates upset, and we call that peace. Peacemakers are people who avoid confrontation at all costs. They ignore issues and they wear a happy face and call that peace. That is not peace. That is not peace. Very often one of the things I need to confront right from the beginning is that we very often, attempting to be peacemakers, will establish what we'll call a peace out here where people aren't yelling and screaming and they're not making confrontations and we don't feel any tension out here but we have all sorts of strife in here and we've never dealt with real issues. Jeff Van Vonderen coined a phrase called a no-talk rule rule. And we've dealt with that several times in our church together. And how there are, we have little categories of things in the church that you just can't talk about. And you can't bring them up. And in your family, you probably have little no-talk rules about things you just can't talk about. And as long as we don't talk about it, nobody gets upset. And nobody gets angry. And nobody gets their feelings hurt. The problem, and then we call it peace. The problem is, the issues that need to be talked about never are. And the internal peace of God never comes. Much of what I'm afraid we call peacemaking is a pretend kind of peace. It's placating and appeasing. It has no conviction. And it really isn't peacemaking. John 14, 47 is a key verse in our study. It's when Jesus says, and these are familiar words, it's when Jesus says this, peace I leave with you. But wait a minute, I know you got a goofy impression of what peace is. Let me clarify. It's my peace I give unto you. And let me clarify it even more. It is not as the world gives peace, give I unto you. My peace I give to you. What is the world's kind of peace? What is the peace that the world offers and delivers and deals in? I've already kind of given it to you. The world's peace, the kind of peace that the world offers is what I would call simply an external peace. It's getting people to put down their guns. And see, we can get people to stop shooting, but we can't get them to stop hating. And Jesus says, the kind of peace I want to get goes to the heart that doesn't just get people to stop shooting and talking and yelling, it gets them to start loving, you see. See, a lot of what we call peacemaking is really truce-making. You know what a truce is? A truce is when you put your guns down long enough to reload. See, the world's peace can do an external thing and stop people from yelling, but people are still resenting. And they can stop people from hitting, but they are still raging in their spirits. And we can stop people from abusing little children, but we haven't dealt with the depraved heart. And we can stop confrontations in the home and in the church that are very hard to handle. And the way we can stop those is to start avoiding issues and pretend everything's okay and stuff feelings we've got and ignore issues. We see that in families. If any of you are living with an alcoholic, or someone whose behavior is much like that of an alcoholic, you know what it feels like to know there are certain things you can't talk about. And in the name of peace, you don't talk about those things, and you never confront, and the person who's doing the behavior is never responsible for the behavior. And we call that peace. That isn't peace. That's external world stuff. And Jesus says, I want to go to the heart and deal with the issues. And anything that does not deal honestly with the issues is not peace. And I don't care if you stop yelling. we have had people in our church and i weep when i hear this people in our church who've given testimony from time to time or come to my office and they have said things like this when i was a child i was abused sexually but one of the problems in my family was we could never talk about what was really going on and it was never appropriate to have pain and so i could never talk about it and I could never get it out. And it would always look like peace. But now I'm 27 years old and I'm having some struggles in my life and in my marriage. And I'm all of a sudden now beginning to realize that it goes back to that thing there. And I need to talk about it and get it out. And I weep because I think of the pain that people and the bondage that people have been in for years and years and years. And I rejoice that finally they're finding a place where they can come and get it out and speak the words and say the truth about their pain so that something real can come to them. And you know what it is? Real peace. in here. There are churches that run that way too. There are many churches where the carnal, whining, immature babies who wouldn't recognize the work of God if it bit them on the nose are the ones who dominate the work. You know why? Because the peacemakers, knowing that there's a carnal person there and that it's an attitude that's immature, the peacemakers say well we we can't resist them and we don't want to have a problem we don't want to confront anybody so we give in and say it's peacemaking that's not peacemaking that's placating that's compromising god wants peace in his church and he wants peace he wants peace in the home and he wants it in the world but the peace that he brings and the peace he calls us to is not mush it is not born of silence and avoidance and pretending it is not characterized by appeasement and lack of conviction Another key verse as this thought flows is James chapter 3 verse 17. It's another one you've heard before. The words say this, Wisdom, the wisdom that is from above is first of all what? You know the word, pure. Then it is peaceable, easy to entreat, full of good fruits and on and on and on. Significant, first, pure. The wisdom from above is first pure. The word pure we got from last week, our study, when we dealt with the pure in heart. The word pure means unmixed, undivided, real, authentic, true. Wisdom from above is first of all true. It is first of all pure. It is first of all real and authentic. Hear this. Any form of peace that does not issue from what's real, that does not deal with what's real and true and pure, is a pretend peace. Let me say it this way. The wisdom that is from God finds its way to peace. Hear that? The wisdom that is from God finds its way to peace, not through pretending nothing's wrong, avoiding heart issues, ignoring sin and carnality. The wisdom that is from God finds its way to peace through dealing honestly with what is true and pure and evident and with what is happening. It says out loud. It confronts what is real and it exposes what is false. You know what? I don't know if you're getting this already. There's a real paradox emerging from what I'm doing here. My picture of what a peacemaker is changing radically and it feels kind of uncomfortable. You know why? Because I'm beginning to get this picture of someone who is really going to be a peacemaker in the kingdom of God is going to have to be someone who is willing to move into conflict, not run away from it. Do you see that? That's kind of bizarre. you know another thing i gotta share with you right now i've always wondered in the flow of these things we're going to make this more clear next time we get to this back to our study but i've always wondered why at the end of these things it says blessed are those who when men cast insult to you and persecute you and say all sorts of evil things against you falsely why why they would say that about nice little gentle grandmotherly peacemakers who were going around oh no don't let's not talk about that you know these gentle little people people don't cast insult to people like that, gentle little peacemakers, at least the way we've defined peacemaking. But people do get frustrated with and angry with people who are bringing the kingdom kind of peace that does not allow for an external peace, but constantly confronts what is real so that we can get to real peace. Those kinds of confrontive people who are bringing the real peace of God upset the apple cart. Matthew 10 and Luke 12 both say these words that are kind of upsetting. Jesus is speaking. The same Jesus who said, blessed are the peacemakers, says this, do not suppose that I came to bring peace, but rather division. What? From now on, Jesus says, five members of a household will be divided, three against two and two against three. What? What is going on? What an incredible contradiction. Why would he say that? Well, maybe he didn't really care about peace. He's just kind of changing his mind. He doesn't care about peace at all. It has nothing to do with that and that couldn't be further from the truth. The reason for that is because the peace that Jesus wants to bring deals with truth first. It deals with truth first. It says what's real and it says it out loud. And that kind of peace bringing, that kind of truth bringing, the kind of peace that only comes through truth is a peace bringing and a truth saying that sometimes causes strife at first. The same Jesus who said, blessed are the peacemakers, went to the Pharisees and said, and you've heard this over and over from this pulpit, you what? Hypocrites. That's not a very nice thing to say. That's not a very peaceful thing to say. Why would he say that if he was a peacemaker? Because he knew something. That is this, that real peace, real peace, my peace, comes first through purity, through honesty, through what is genuine, through what is real. And he didn't tippy-toe around the Pharisees and go, they're really not that bad. You know, that would have been the role of a peacemaker in our mind, right? As the Pharisees and the people were at war, he would have walked in and said, no, no, you guys, you've got to understand these Pharisees. They just think a little different. You hypocrites! Why? Because real peace that I bring is an abiding, everlasting, internal peace, but it will never come through pretending that what is wrong is right. Never. My peace I give unto you. Acts 24 verse 5 has an interesting thing to say about Paul. He is before Felix and the testimony against him is this. We find him to be a pestilent fellow. I thought of Jeff Van Vonderen as soon as I read that. The New American Standard called him a real pest. Why? Because he never settled for an external quiet. He wanted internal peace that came through truth, dealing with what's real. It's amazing to me, hear this, how Satan perverts the truth. You see, if he can't get the people of God to get tripped up and move into disobedience because they've got a hard heart or a disobedient, rebellious heart. And if you do have a rebellious heart, he's going to get you and use you to destroy the church. But if he can't get you that way, you know what he'll do? He'll take flabby teaching and take truths like blessed are the peacemakers and lay that on a tender heart like yours. A tender heart, a loving heart, a gentle heart that wants genuinely to bring peace. And he'll take that truth and he'll take a tender heart and turn it into a mushy heart, which is not a peace-bringing heart. It's perverted, you see. And without knowing it, some of us, gentle, loving, caring people, allow the work of Satan not only to continue in the church but to thrive. Why? Because in the name of peace we fail to confront issues, we fail to tell the truth, we fail to call what is real, real. A friend of mine was telling me about a situation in another church, but it happens here, it's the same kind of thing. Where they were having a problem with someone in a ministry issue, And this person was extremely hard to deal with. And they were very, very petty. And everything was just slowing down all the time because of this person. And basically it was an immaturity issue, a carnal issue. And they brought the people together, which is a good plus, a big point. Way to go. That's what you do. But the problem was, in an effort to bring peace, the way we got to have peace was to say, now, now, now, this person's not being that bad, and this is okay. Let's just all be together. Hug and kisses. Let's just shake and forget it, okay? Never dealt with the issue. Never said, maybe we got a problem. I need to tell you that I love you and I care about you, but you know how you're acting? You're acting like a baby. You're acting immature. We need to come along. We need to grow a little bit. And we're not going to yield to this kind of attitude. And you know what happens? When you hear those kinds of things, it kills you. You hate it. But if your spirit is open to what God is saying, you can begin to grow. And you know what you can begin to discover? A real peace. That lets go of all your striving. I need to say something else here before I move on to the second point. Because as I give you all sorts of permission to speak the truth, you know, and real peacemakers tell the truth and they move into conflict, I can see it stirring up a whole lot of carnality in carnal people who are really into telling the truth, you know. Ah, you're ugly. Well, that's the truth, you know. I think this is real important that I make this clarification here. You have no right to use the truth on anyone in a corrective way unless you love them. I'm telling you the heart of a peacemaker is committed to the truth. But you know what else? The heart of a peacemaker is committed to bring healing. That's why they tell the truth. The reason they use the truth is not to hurt and to maim and to win an argument. When I'm around people like that, they get rebuked. And when I'm around people like that and they bring the truth to me to hurt me, you know what happens to me? I get hurt. But it isn't a healing hurt. I know what it feels like to get confronted and realize I'm wrong, and I understand the peace that genuinely comes to me when I go, I'm sorry. And I get peace. No more pretending. But some people use the truth and would hear even what I'm saying as licensed to walk around going, Stop! You will not have your way here. But a group of people, kingdom people, who are committed to the truth, who are uncovering what's false, who are openly talking about what's real, who realize that real peace only comes through truth and purity and what's real. But they're doing it. Why? Because they've got a burning heart to heal and bring people back to health in Jesus. Matthew 18 is a good example of that you're familiar with that I don't have time to read it where it says if you see a sinning brother you go to him and if they don't repent you go and you bring someone else and if they don't repent you bring it before the whole church and that is speaking the truth telling them what's wrong but the whole intention of that verse is to restore and to heal and if you bring stuff to people just to win an argument you are not doing kingdom work just know that clearly let's move on that's the perversion of peace making second of all the enemies to peace and there are several first of all write these down if you want to get them there's several first of all sin is an enemy to peace now when i say that what i'm talking about to begin with because i'm going to bring this up again in the life of the believer but sin what i mean here is sin in the world okay sin in the world sin as dealing with the condition of man is being sinful. The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. That is the condition of man without Christ. Man is at war with God. He has no peace with God. The fact is, there is no peace without dealing with the sin issue. It cannot happen. And the reason it cannot happen is because real peace only comes through what? Truth. And we can't pretend sin isn't there and say, oh, I'm at peace with God. You got to deal with the sin. and the answer to the sin issue is a glorious one it is the redemption that comes through his blood the forgiveness of sins ephesians 2 11 18 has some powerful words about the peace that he brought he says in verse 12 remember that you were at one time separate from christ excluded from the commonwealth strangers to the covenant of promise no hope and without god you were at war with god but now in christ jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near how by the blood of Christ and he himself is our peace and he brought both groups into one and broke down the barrier and the dividing walls how did he do that by abolishing in his flesh the conflict the enmity which is the law and the commandments contained in ordinances that in himself he might make the two into one new man thus establishing peace with God and he might reconcile bring together bring peace, them, both in one body to God through the cross, by it having been put to death, by having put to death the enemy. It's interesting. He put to death the war. Isn't that interesting? He put to death the war with God and man. And then verse 17, he says this, and he came and he preached peace to you who were far away and preached peace to you who were near. I got good news for you. If you're in Jesus Christ, the war is over. The war is over. Therefore, if any man is in Christ, he, therefore, I'm sorry, Romans 5, 1, therefore, having been justified by faith, we have what? Peace with God. Problem. This leads me to the next enemy of peace. There's a lot of Christians who do indeed understand that they have peace with God in a theological sense, but they don't experience the peace of God on an ongoing basis. And the reason that is is because there's more than one enemy to peace. Another enemy to peace would be this, an inability to fully sit down in and accept and receive the fullness of the redemption that Jesus has given you. And we talk about this all the time here. The fact that I'm forgiven, but I don't really sense I'm forgiven. I don't really let it in. I don't really believe it. One of the things you need to do is get around believers like here in kinship groups and be in a position where you're constantly being affirmed relative to who you are in Jesus Christ. But we don't let it in, and we don't really believe that we're accepted and complete in Christ. And the result is there is no rest. Hebrews 4, 1 and 2 says this, Let us fear that while a promise of rest and forgiveness and just relaxing in the grace of God remains, that any of you would fall short of it and not enter into that rest. Like the Israelites they give the example had good news preached to them about the rest that was theirs, about the grace of God, but the message didn't profit them. Why? Because they never did link it with faith. They never did believe it. They never did accept it and say, I know I'm forgiven and I am at peace with God. Sometimes the lack of peace you feel is that you're not redeemed. And you're going to have to deal with that. Sometimes you're redeemed but you just have a hard time letting the grace of God affect you. But there's another enemy. And it doesn't have so much to do with my identity as it has to do with my circumstances. It has to do with a lack of faith as it relates to the external circumstances in my life. And I have a hard time believing when I look at the things in my life that God really is in control. And I begin, by the way, to get my peace drawn from external things. You're talking in circles, I don't understand. I can help you get to the core of this by asking you a question. And ask this of yourself. What is it that you look to in your life right now, externally, that is your source of peace? What is it that you look to right now that you have to have and if you have that thing then you'll be at peace. For some of you it could be your kids. If my kids were just a little bit different like this or that then I would have peace. For some of you it's your job. If my job was a little bit different like this then I would have peace. Some of it's your boss. Some of you it's your husband. Some of you it's the church. If the church was a little bit different I would have peace. And all those things need to line up. And if my house was different I'd have peace. And if somebody else was different I'd have peace. I got something to share with you. And it's a promise. It's this. If your peace is contingent on external circumstances lining up the way you need them to line up, you are going to have peace as long as all those external things line up. And you know what that means? You're not going to have much peace. Real peace. The inner settledness about who I am in Christ. And inner confidence in God's ability to sustain me in whatever circumstance I am in. No matter what is going on out here is the kind of peace that he offers. And that only comes when Jesus on a day-to-day-to-day basis really is my source. And not everything else out here. The glory of the peace that he gives is this. That there could be an incredible war going on out here. I could be confronting people all day long. But the peace that he gives would give me a contentment in here. That is a supernatural kingdom peace. That allows me to bring truth into situations. That allows me to confront stuff. that allows me to love people genuinely. And while the war goes on, there's a peace that passes understanding inside because he's my source. By the way, if your peace is dependent on external tranquility, you'll never, not only know peace, you'll never be a peacemaker. You know why? Because you'll be the person I described earlier that constantly makes sure nothing tension-wise happens. Why? Because your peace is contingent on everything out here being okay. and so you'll always walk on eggshells make sure you never upset the apple pie that's bondage there's another enemy to peace and it's sin as it relates to believers not in the world but in you and me and you know that I don't need to tell you that Psalm 32 gives an illustration of that David in verses 3 and 4 he said this when I kept silent about my sin my body wasted away through groaning all day long day and night your hand was heavy upon me and my vitality drained as with the heat of summer you know what that means? he had no peace you know what? there are people here today who have no peace and you are with God redeemed and you know and you're even trying to claim all that stuff that I gave you a few minutes ago yeah that's my problem I just need to let it in and by faith receive it if you've got blatant sin in your life if you've got known sin in your life you can't claim that stuff your body is wasting away and you know it the good news about Psalm 32 is this when David said when I acknowledged my sin when I confessed it when I quit hiding thou didst forgive my sin and you know what he got back? peace peace and I would just release the power of the spirit here this morning to give you the freedom and the power you know what happens when we sin as believers we run from god no it's like adam in the garden we run away we're ashamed and what we need to begin to learn to do is that that is one of the tools that satan wants to use on us to keep us from having peace because when i sin you know what i need to know that i got an advocate with the father and if i confess my sin he is faithful and just to forgive and rather than run from god beloved we as kingdom people need to learn that when we sin we run to God and say, God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I want to have fellowship restored. Relationship is always there. I want to have fellowship restored. And as the Spirit of God would minister to some of you, don't leave this morning without dealing with that, if that's the enemy to your peace. Sometimes it's between a brother and a sister in Christ. In Matthew 5, 23 and 24, it says you're coming to worship. And you realize that you've got something with a brother or sister in the body of Christ. Jesus said, leave your sacrifice on the altar. Don't come and worship until you've gone and dealt with your brother and cleared up that issue between the two of you. You can't claim peace. You can't act like there's peace by pretending there isn't and going and worshiping God and raising your hands and getting tears in your eyes. Why? Because real peace only comes through truth. So you stop. Let's deal with the truth. You go to that brother or sister and you say I'm sorry and you or whatever you need to say and then you come back ever have any trouble worshiping maybe it's the songs maybe it's the attitude you got when you cut maybe it's sin maybe it's sin leave the altar go to the brother go to the sister sin is an enemy to peace I got to tell you one more and I'm very aware of this one right now in my life and in the lives of people that I'm around Satan is an enemy to peace well of course that Satan is an enemy to peace Don't let that be like, oh yeah, I knew he'd say that. Hear that powerfully. You see, there are times in our lives when the problem that we're struggling with and the turmoil you feel, please hear this, is not a problem with sin. It is not a problem with lack of faith or unbelief. It is not a problem of letting the grace of God in, but you still feel a lack of peace and there's a sense of turmoil. We, beloved, need to understand. We need to know. And the bigger we get and the more significant the ministry that you are involved in and I am involved in becomes, We better know that we have an enemy who wants to bring us down. He wants to bring you down. He wants to destroy your life. He wants to destroy this church. Know it. And he will get us, when there is no sin, to start thinking up sins that we did. You ever do that? When you're feeling just oppressed and heavy, you start going, I confess, and you're making stuff up, you know. And it turns into shame, and you start feeling like a worm, and he's going, ha ha, there isn't anything. and we need to begin as we have relationships with each other and here i go again we need these kinship things where we're in relationship with people where we can come on a weekly basis and say i'm really struggling this week and it may be sin and you confess it but it may not be and we put hands on you and pray for you that the power of christ would flow through you and satan would be bound we need to do that ministry here we need to be praying for each other and the more by the way, you become a peacemaker and deal with truth and confront issues, the more Satan will move against you to keep you from doing that. Know that. It will come in two ways. There will be a sense of oppression. There will be a sense of oppression. You know what? He doesn't like it that we're talking about him today either. There will be a sense of oppression. And generally, what I believe is this. It's a heavy thing, it's dull, and it is vague. One of the ways I can spot the work of the evil one in my heart is that the sense I have of lack of peace is a vague one. The glory of the Holy Spirit's conviction is this. When the Holy Spirit's conviction comes to you relative to sin, he puts his finger right on the issue. David, you did this then, and you know it. Thou art the man. There isn't any fuzzy stuff. And I might spend a lot of energy rationalizing and pushing it away, but the conviction of the Holy Spirit is right now, this thing. The attack of Satan and the oppression of Satan is this vague thing. What's the matter? I don't know. Is it sin? I don't think so. Just be aware that that is very possibly the work of the enemy. And when that happens, you know what you need to do? You need to pray. And if that's not working, you need to get people to pray for you. I believe with all my heart that the ministry of this church has significantly expanded in the last several months. I believe with all my heart it's just begun. And I believe with all my heart that with that excitement that I feel, I know that I have sensed a greater level of oppression than I ever have in my life. A greater sense of the enemy attacking you and me. And we need to be aware that the enemy of peace is an enemy. The evil one. He accuses too, not just oppression, he accuses. He comes with lies. He'll remind you of past sin, that the blood is covered. He'll bring those things up and remind you and say, He doesn't love you. God doesn't care about you. He couldn't forgive you. And you know what? If you believe that, you will remove yourself from effective service. Why? Because of shame. And it's the work of the evil one. And you need people around you who are supporting you and praying for you and telling you that the lies that Satan's telling you are lies. He'll take present struggles and he'll tell you things about the present struggles and create doubts about God's care for you and his love and his ability to deliver you. We have an adversary and he wants to bring us down. We need to be aware. We need each other to do spiritual warfare. Third to call. The call to be peacemakers. 2 Corinthians, turn with me, would you? Just as we close. 2 Corinthians chapter 5. This is wonderful. verse 17 talking about redemption in verse 17 therefore if any man is in Christ he's a brand new person a brand new creature the old things are passed away behold new things have come he's been raised from death to life now verse 18 all these things are from God what these things the fact that you're a new creature in Christ the fact that you're filled with the spirit the fact that you're holy and blameless before God they are all from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ he made peace with us through christ and god and then what he did was after he made peace with god for us through christ he gave after giving us the peace he gave us the ministry of peace he gave us the ministry of reconciliation namely that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself bringing peace to the world through himself not counting their trespasses against them and he has committed to us the word of reconciliation he has committed to us the work of bringing peace that peace of grace and forgiveness therefore we are ambassadors for christ listen to this we are ambassadors for christ as though god himself were calling people through us were entreating people through us we beg you on behalf of christ be reconciled to god do you see that god reconciled you through Christ to himself. And when he did that, it brought peace to you. He gave you the same ministry of reconciliation to bring grace and life and mercy and forgiveness. And when you do that, it is as if God himself is begging through you to the world, be at peace with God. Come to know Jesus, the giver of peace, in here, not out here. To be a peacemaker is not pretending that everything is great in avoiding and ignoring issues, with a view to heal, to bring the peace of God to homes, to work, to school, to church, to the world. The bottom line on this, being a peacemaker, is being evangelistic. It's evangelism. No wonder in Romans 10, 15, it says, How beautiful are the feet of those who bring the good news of the gospel of peace. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God. How do you know a real son? How do you know a kingdom dweller not the person who's walking around appeasing and placating problems it's the one who brings the light into darkness the one who brings the truth where lies are the one who brings reality where hypocrisy dwells the one who brings grace where legalism thrives the one who brings holiness to where carnality lives where are you at today where are you at today maybe you're not even at peace with god you don't know him as your savior i entreat you as it were god in treating through me be reconciled to god today maybe you are at peace with god and you know you're among the redeemed but you're not experiencing the peace of god would you let the spirit of god do an inventory on you maybe it's because you just don't believe that you're really forgiven and you need to sit down in it today and accept it and receive it maybe with circumstances you're starting to draw your life and your peace from things that can't give it and just today maybe even with a click sometimes i can do that just with a switch i go i'm doing that i'm going to quit doing that i'm going to go over here maybe you can do that getting life and peace from things that can't give it maybe there is for you a real sin unconfessed deal with it today don't run away run too maybe you are in a situation where satan is really attacking you and you've become a target for his manipulation and his lies i want you to be able to come so we can pray for you and set you free from that and come underneath and do warfare with you against the enemy a peacemaker you know maybe you really do have a heart to heal but the peace that you've been bringing to your home and the peace that you've been bringing to the church and your relationships has not been coming through truth it's been mush and i'd like to pray for you for courage to be a kingdom peacemaker the wisdom from above is first of all pure. It deals with what's real. Then it's peaceable. Easy to be entreated. Full of good fruits. But you know what? If you walk out of here this morning and you start doing that kind of peacemaking, you're going to need the next text next week. You just remember that. You just remember that. We're going to go to a time of worship. just believe that the spirit of God works time and as you feel the spirit of God speak to you it may be that you'll know you need to come and have ministry it may be that you want to receive Jesus Christ as your savior and be made at peace with God and we want you to come, people will come and minister to you it may be that you're under attack and you need to be prayed for it may be that right where you're sitting without coming forward the spirit of God can minister to you we want to have freedom in this time so the spirit of God can do what he does Thank you.
