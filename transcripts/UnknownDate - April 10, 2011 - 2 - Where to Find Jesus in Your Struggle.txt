If you came in this morning having lost the plot this week, Having messed up, having your best efforts fallen way short of what they should have been or what you hoped they would have been. The good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ says this, he meets you there. In your failure, in your lostness, and in your brokenness. Jesus meets you there. So if you are bedraggled today, welcome to the other thousand of us who are also bedraggled. Colossians 3 verse 12. If you would turn your Bibles there, we will continue on in the fire hose, as Joel called it. Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourself with compassion and kindness and humility with gentleness and patience and bear with each other. Forgive one another. If any of you has a grievance against someone and forgive as the Lord forgave you and over all these virtues put on love which binds them all together in perfect unity. Bear with each other. It's the phrase we camped on last week, and I told you that as I was in my study last week on Tuesday morning, looking at this passage, when the phrase bear with each other came into my view, my first and 50th reaction was what? No. No way even. and I was just being honest as I looked at the landscape of hard things in my life. Put on compassion, put on kindness, put on humility, put on gentleness and put on patience and in doing so, bear with one another, even forgive one another. All of that sounded to me like an immense struggle that I was not sure that I was up to. so we took a look at last week at this amazing story found in Mark chapter 6 where the disciples of Jesus have been sent out and they come back to him and they're saying look at all we've done it's been amazing all that we've taught and the miracles that we've done and you can see them sort of pouring this out to Jesus and Jesus's reaction to them is man great job you guys so let's get away by yourselves so you can what rest looked at the importance of pausing and being honest about where you were at. And so into this rest, they were invited by Jesus. But what we found out was something terrible happened. Needy people from all around the area beat them to the place that they were going and met them there. So into the place that they were supposed to be resting, came need. Have you ever been there? Has that ever happened to you? You're looking forward to this so much, and then boom. No. And so Jesus had compassion on these people and was teaching them all day long. We read so much so that one of the disciples came up to Jesus and said, Jesus, you got to send these guys away. I mean, they're, I mean, they, they are, they've got to be hungry, so send them to the surrounding villages and towns so they can buy something to eat. Send them anywhere but here, because remember, this is our time to rest, and maybe even eat. I mean, that wouldn't be a terrible thing to do. To which Jesus says this, you give them something to eat, which is so uncompassionate. and unkind. Well, to that, the disciples said, we don't have enough. Even if we pooled all of our money together, it would take a year's wages to buy enough bread, just bread for these guys to eat. It would cost way too much. And so we found last week that at the intersection of empty and full, Jesus gives you an invitation to be full of that which you are empty of, courage and compassion and kindness and gentleness and humility. Jesus offers a way for you to be full of those things. Jesus also offers a way for you to be empty of the things that you are currently full of, rage, malice, anger, slander. So at this intersection of empty and full, Jesus meets us. Well, this week we're going to talk a little more about the struggle of bearing with each other because it is a struggle. To bear with means to stand up as straight and firm as you can and hold someone else up. That sounds to me like a struggle. To endure with someone. Now, you don't need to endure something that you are enjoying, right? It means to delay punishment, to bear with someone. As I think about it, it reminds me a lot of mile 25 in a marathon. Now, my friend took this picture of me. This is on Summit Avenue, about mile 25. And you'll want to notice a couple things about this picture. But if you look at my face, look at my eyes in particular, That look is saying, I have no resources left. One mile seems like about 20 miles right now to go. I have no idea how I'm going to make it. I have nothing left. There's not enough in me to finish this race. And the last thing that you can notice as you look at that picture is even on mile 25, I am passing that guy. no look at his face too he's struggling just as much as I am now into your struggle whatever it is right now there is a large chance that you feel like you are at mile 25 and there are no resources left and you cannot make it to the end in your struggle to bear with someone else, to forgive someone else, to hold someone else up, to endure someone else one more day, one more week, one more time, my guess is that you are feeling like you are at mile 25. And maybe the person that you have to endure that you're struggling so much enduring is yourself. so how do we come honestly to God saying here I am in my struggle I don't know how to make it but here I am well I kept reading after the story of the feeding of the 5,000 where Jesus gave them bread in their hands. Remember this? Just a little bit of bread. Remember, my contention was that the multiplication didn't happen until after it was given away because it just wouldn't have worked. If Jesus prayed and blessed it, then it would have become a mountain of bread and fish, and then everyone would have clamored. It would have been chaos. No, the bread multiplied when it was in the disciples' hands and they went to the people having just a tiny little bit of bread and a tiny little bit of fish. And they said, well, here's all I have. And then they looked down and they said, there's more. Here's all I have. And they looked down and said, oh my goodness, there's more. After that story, there's another magnificent story of struggle. And it's found in Mark 6, starting in verse 47. I'll read it to you. Now Jesus, after this was all said and done, he sent the disciples away and then he dismissed the crowd. We read in the verses that are previous to that. And my interpretation of that is like, thanks guys, this lesson wasn't really for you, it was for them. I'm glad that you, you know, got your fill of food, but I needed to teach these guys something about what was available to them. So Jesus dismisses them, sends the disciples off in a boat. And when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he, Jesus, was alone on land. So picture this in your mind's eye. And then we read, he, that is Jesus, saw the disciples straining at the oars. I love that phrase. Have you ever been there? straining at the oars because the wind was against them. And then shortly after dawn, he went out to them, walking on the lake. Now, look at that passage. And if you're looking at it, trying to notice things, something in there should make you extremely angry. I don't want to have this be a where's Waldo thing completely. But you may notice that when he notices them, it's evening time. He notices them straining against the oars. The wind is against them. And then we read, shortly after dawn, he went out to them. Thank you. that is a long night of struggle here's what's happening to these guys they're dying out there right they are dying out there so in your struggle as you're straining against the oars and the wind is against you from this passage we learn some things the first thing we learn is this Jesus sees you in your struggle Jesus sees you but sometimes Jesus seems to be okay leaving you in it for a while to which our collective response is awesome now from evening to morning the time where you're struggling against the oars wondering where God is asking God to come pleading for God to come begging for God to come and still you're struggling what's happening in you well the first thing that's happening in you is you may notice some things you may notice i don't like to struggle oh god please give me a parking spot that's close because i'm late oh god please don't let it rain today on my party I'm just being honest right we don't like to struggle even in the little things but sometimes I think in the struggle some things get revealed that are very helpful to future struggles in my struggle when it's not taken away from me I think about Paul when Paul says, I pleaded with the Lord three times to remove this thorn of flesh, this thorn in my flesh. Remember that little passage? Paul wrote Colossians. Paul wrote that piece too. God, remove me from my struggle. Paul said, here's what I've learned as I've had to deal with the struggle, is that God's grace actually is sufficient for me. And what I think you learn in the struggle, if you press into it, and are willing to press into it, honestly, and, you know, with all your rantings and ravings, is you see how many other things you try to be sufficient for you until you finally realize that it's God that is sufficient for you. maybe just one extra drink tonight will be sufficient for me maybe one more meaningless relationship will be sufficient for me maybe looking really really good and performing really really well will be sufficient for me what is sufficient for you that would be a great question to ponder. When I'm struggling, what makes me feel like I have enough? When you struggle long enough, you realize those things that actually aren't sufficient don't work. And I wonder if that's a part of why Jesus is okay letting us struggle for a little while. Now, I don't know that that's true. There are some struggles that you go through that the answer, honestly, is I don't know why God hasn't shown up. And you might think, I have learned plenty. Thank you very much. When we have to struggle, when we find ourselves in the struggle, we find ourselves crying out prayers like the one found in Psalm 22. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? It's the prayer that Jesus was reciting from memory when he was hanging on the cross. If you read Psalm 22, it's an amazing journal entry from someone who's going through incredible struggle. If you are going through struggle right now, one of the most helpful things you can do is just to meditate on Psalm 22. It teaches you about honest struggle. So Jesus sees you in your struggle. And sometimes, Jesus leaves you in your struggle for a while. And I wish that was not true. I wish I could just say, Just cry out to God and God will come. But if I said that, you would know that I was absolutely lying. Cry out to God in your struggle. Do it as honestly as you can. Because there's some more truth about God in the struggle. Let's keep reading in the story. Mark 6, verse 48. So at dawn, when he finally goes out to them, we read, he was about to pass by them, but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost, which is exactly what you and I might think, right? No, because we don't believe in ghosts. They did believe in ghosts. They were terrified. If they thought the wind was gonna kill them, At this point, they thought for sure this ghost was going to kill them. And so they all cried out because when they saw him, they were terrified. And he immediately, he spoke to them. And he said this, take courage, it is I, don't be afraid. Then he climbed into the boat with them. And if you're struggling right now, those should be very welcome words. At just the right time, Jesus speaks and moves into your struggle. At just the right time, Jesus speaks and moves into your struggle. And the word that I think many of us need to receive this morning in our struggle is this. Take courage. It is I. Don't be afraid. Take courage. Jesus is saying, it's me. I know you. You know you? I made you. I'm in you. I'm with you. Don't be afraid literally means in your fear, don's run. Doesn's mean not to be afraid. You ever tried not to be afraid? Don't be afraid. Okay, sweet. No, it means in your fear, don't run away from here. In your fear, don't run. in your struggle don't run those are the words that Jesus speaks but then Jesus also moves and when we did you notice that phrase Jesus when he was about to pass by and again if you read the scriptures noticing things you're like what why was he going to pass by I mean hey guys you know Now, this is where the translation is really terrible, but the word to pass by literally means, it's a compound word, para is part of it. Para means to come alongside. It means to come alongside and be present. To come alongside and be present in your struggle. The word that also has the word come alongside, which you may know is the word paraclete. Paraclete, it's the word that we use to translate the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity. Para means to come alongside. And the word paraclete is translated, the commentators agree, it's one of the hardest words in the Greek language to translate. Sometimes it's translated comforter, sometimes advocate, sometimes helper. But it's all these things that try to describe what it means for God, God's self, to come toward you, alongside of you, and be present to you. In some of my studying this week, there was a commentator that said, in a certain African language, there's an idiom that is used to describe the Holy Spirit, and the idiom means one who mothers you. One who mothers you. Now, if some of you had a good mom, you know that when a mom is mothering really well and a kid is hurting, that mother comes right alongside, kneels down, looks that little kid right in the face, kisses him, bandages him, lifts him up in her arms and holds him. That's the picture of what God does to us. Here's another picture of what this could look like. That's just so appropriate right now. I love that. Let her cry. It's fine. That, of course, is Mother Teresa. She's holding a little baby who has no arms. Look at the look on their faces. It's as if Mother Teresa is holding the most valuable thing on the planet. And look at the look in the baby's eyes. It's as if she believes she's the most valuable thing on the planet. This is a picture of the paraclete. If you are struggling right now, you need to know this is who God is. One who sees value in you. One who runs to you. Another translation is someone who falls on you when you're down and scoops you up and carries you to safety. Jesus, through the Holy Spirit, sees you in your struggle and at just the right time moves and speaks into your struggle, climbs into the boat with you and says, whatever happens, we're in this thing together. Now that's good news, right? Woo! Mark 6, rest of the story. Starting in verse 51, and then after Jesus climbs in the boat with them, the wind dies down. Who can do that? And they were completely amazed, for they had not understood about the loaves. And I love that that's in there. It's like this, How could you not understand about the loaves? I mean, it was 5,000 men were fed along with all the women and children through five loaves and two fish, and they didn't get it. It's so very much like me and you to not get it. Oh, he had to do it again. God had to be even more creative to show me that God is enough. God had to be even more creative to show me that God is with me in my struggle and that there is enough and that God is enough and that I, their hearts were hardened. They didn't get it. But when they had crossed over. Now, Hebrew, Old Testament scholars should be, a big light should be blinking right now with those two words. crossed over. They landed at Gennesaret and anchored there. Anytime you read about, I've told you this before, water in the scriptures or words like crossover, you need to see that a huge illusion is being made here. Illusion. It's another metaphor from death to life. Leaving death on one shore and going to life on the other shore. See, what we see in this story is that Jesus transforms their struggle of straining at the oars and uses it as the very thing that will help them cross over and be anchored. Your struggle, the thing that you hate right now, the thing that you would give anything to be out of, and you should want to give anything to be out of it right now, because it's terrible, it's hard, it's brutal. if you let the work take its course, the struggle will be what God uses to help you cross over and be anchored in something much more firm and true. When we're empty of what we need, Jesus provides us a way to be full. When we're empty of courage, and Jesus, and compassion, and kindness, and humility, and gentleness, and patience. Jesus provides us a way to be full of those things, and many times that way is struggle. I wish it wasn't. You're thinking, awesome message. I had this great talk today. You have to struggle. But Jesus also provides you a way to be empty when you're full of all the things that will never help you to cross over. Things like rage and anger and impatience, jealousy, that which makes us give up on others and ourselves and God. At that intersection, Jesus provides you a way to be full of God. Now to close this talk, what I'd like to do is bring a thing that I think, it's a word that I think God has for us. When you think about bearing with each other, holding each other up, enduring each other, withholding punishment from each other. The primary people that I think need to hear this message right now is men and women. Because I think in terms of marriage anyway, not just in this church, but all around the church, women and men are not seeing each other. and not bearing with each other. And the result is destroying the church. Women are looking at their husbands with contempt. And with their words, they are emasculating them to their face, behind their back. And this is not okay. It is destroying your husband. And men are looking at their wives as objects to use for sex, to get the work done that they don't want to do. And it is destroying the community that is the church. men and women are not seeing each other face to face eye to eye bearing with each other and in this moment I believe Church of the Open Door Jesus is inviting us into a different way of being with one another forgiving one another being compassionate to one another looking down at the bread that you have in your hands going it's not enough this is going to cost me way too much if I move toward her with compassion if I move toward him with compassion but I have to believe that as I do that Jesus will multiply what I have there is a different way of being that Jesus is inviting his church into and I believe that is a word from God to us now that may have just caused a flurry of panic in your mind that perhaps is absolutely overwhelming you here's what's true about what God does and what God is into your struggle in that arena right now. God will generously provide all that you need so that you will always have everything you need even in that struggle and plenty left over to share with others and hold them up and endure with them and bear with them. Amen. Breathe in. Breathe out. And stand up and I want to pray a prayer of benediction over you. now the prayer I want to pray is not just a benediction but it's a really a prayer of consecration to that word and so just hang with for another minute Jesus Christ Father God and Holy Spirit enter into our struggle right now especially as it relates to men and women, husbands and wives that aren't seeing each other. And with a kind of miraculous work that you did walking across water and having the winds die down and like you did feeding the 5,000, do a miraculous work in us that could only be from you so that men can look at their wives with love and honor and cherishing them. And that wives would look at their husbands with love and honor and cherishing them so that they really could, from an authentic place, be compassionate and kind and patient with each other. And Jesus, this will only happen if we see you in between us and all people, giving us what we need when we need it, allowing us to see people through your eyes, and going before us to the places that we have not the courage to go. So Jesus, lead on, O King Eternal, into our lives, into our struggles. And we will meet you there and follow. Amen. Amen. Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota.
