Open your Bibles with me to Exodus 33. As we return this morning to our study of a pivotal episode in the life of God's people, I'd like to pray as we go into it. Father, I pray in Jesus' name that the power of your Spirit, which has been so evident already in the context of our worship, would continue to evidence itself. And Father, that as we seek to know your ways relative to your glory, that this particular way of dependence would be one that you would powerfully illustrate and call us to this morning. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, it all began when Moses was presented with the most extraordinary of possibilities. It was this. Moses, it is possible for you to procure for yourself and the people of God what looks to be the provision and promise of God without the active presence of God being involved at all. Chapter 33, Exodus, verses 1 through 3, basically say, Moses, you can enter into the land of promise, you can taste the milk and honey, but I will not go with you. To that possibility, Moses said this, verse 15, Lord, if your presence does not go with us, then do not lead us up from here, for we are a people of the presence, verse 16. It's who we are, it's all we've got, without your manifested presence at work among us. The land of promise, as much as we want it, the milk and honey, as much as we desire it, has no meaning and provides no joy. That was his declaration. We want you more than the milk and honey. Now, to that declaration, he also added a two-fold request. It was this, number one, let me know your ways that I may know you, verse 13. And number two, I pray thee, show me your glory, verse 18. Something that in verses 19 and following, God did in a variety of ways. And we will, over the next several weeks, look at as many of those ways as we can discern in the text. Now that two-fold request of Moses raised for me two weeks ago a question. The question was this. What are the ways of God that reveal the glory of God to the people of God? Well, so far we have touched on three of those ways as we've been able to discern them. The first was this, that one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the way of desire. For God reveals his glory and manifests his presence to people who singularly want it, who passionately pursue it. More than the milk and honey, more than power, success, or fame, much as I might want those things, we want you, said Moses, and the people of God. More than any of that. God's heart is drawn to that. He goes toward that. The second thing that we discovered as being a way of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the way of humility. Embodied in Moses, who though he was a great leader and a faithful servant, a man who spoke with God as a man with a friend, still saw himself as a learner, as a novice, if you will, as one who still needed to discover as though he had never known the ways of God, the ways of God. You need to understand that in the request itself to know the ways of God, given where he was in his stature of leadership, The request itself was a demonstration of humility. Moses didn't just act humble. He was humble. And one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the way of humility. For God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble. God's heart is drawn toward that. He moves into that. Third way of God that reveals the glory of God is the way of reverence for God. And while Moses certainly embodies a spirit of reverence, to fully illustrate this, I told the story of how King David's desire to reconnect the people of God to the manifested presence of God required that they first have rekindled a sense of reverence for the holiness of God. Why? Because one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the way of reverence for the holiness of God. Today the fourth way of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the way of dependence on God. Almost always born of brokenness, where usually in some painful way that quite frankly I would just as soon avoid, it is made clear to me again, I can't do this kingdom stuff myself. And in that place of brokenness I come up recognizing again my only possible hope is God. Not the strength of my hand, not the power of my will, not the dazzling effect of my talent. The fact is, I can't save myself. I can't, by exerting my will, sanctify myself. I can't grow this church. I can't serve effectively by the power of myself. I desperately need, and by the way, this rises in me, this desperate need, when I face some area of brokenness in my life, I desperately need the grace, the filling, and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit of God who is my only possible hope for any of these kingdom realities to be experienced by me and come through me. To that kind of desperate dependence, the power and glory of Almighty God is made manifest. And that is why Paul said in 2 Corinthians 12 verse 9. Most gladly, therefore, I will boast about my weaknesses so that the power of Christ or that the glory of God may be made manifest in me. Therefore, I am well content with insults, distresses, persecutions, and difficulties for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, I don't like feeling weak, but the fact is when I am weak, I am dependent on God. And when I am dependent, I experience a strength from God that I don't experience any other way. And some people might call it glory. And the reason that is true is simply this. One of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the way of dependence on God. The heart of God is drawn to that. He goes toward that. God delights, beloved, to show himself strong and sufficient to those who know they need him, to those who live dependently on him. It's simply one of the ways of God. But most of the time, it is a way that we do not walk in very well. And quite frankly, if honest, it is one of the ways that we do not walk in willingly. In fact, as I even reflect over my own life, the times I have walked in this well are times when God has often brought to me a brokenness that I did not necessarily want. Kind of pulls the rug out from under me and as he does that, the rug goes out and there I am looking up at him again which is where I finally find some peace and strength again. We don't walk in this willingly very often for most of the time our human heart yearns for indeed demands control, independence, self-sufficiency, personal strength, physical capacity. Beyond physical capacity, I would really desire physical superiority. I want to win most of the time, all the time. Perish the thought that I ever look weak, that I ever experience neediness or appear less than capable. It is just, I promise you, it is just not a posture that I would ever choose and certainly not embrace. Oh yes, I love being needy. Let me run to that. Indeed, most of us spend quite a bit of energy marshalling the forces of our life so as to avoid ever looking weak, ever being needy. But here's the deal, people of God. One of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the way of dependence on God. And according to Matthew 5 verse 3, it's a way of begging dependence. That daily recognizes, I can't do this myself. self, my only possible hope for anything I desire relative to kingdom living, it's just God. It's my only hope. Now, I don't know if it helps you to know that the disciples struggled with this life of dependence, but it helps me to know that. And they did. Like you and me, they needed to learn the ways of God that reveal the glory of God. And like you and me, they often needed to learn these ways the hard way. I'd like you to turn with me in your Bibles to the book of Matthew, the 18th chapter, to a story, an episode in the life of the disciples that we dealt with about 11 years ago. There's a story about my pages that stick together. I'll tell it some other time. No, I'll tell them now. Quick. I have a bad voice. I've been struggling with my voice for a couple years. I put a lozenge in my mouth. I spray all over these things. And my pages stick together because there's junk. You know how sticky Exodus 33 is? You have no idea. This is all on tape. It's going out all over anyway. You're hearing more than you needed to know. Episode in the life of the disciples where in a rather painful, embarrassing way, the disciples begin to learn about the ways of God that reveal the glory of God, specifically the way of dependence. A way that in chapter 18, we're going to discover in just a moment, they were not walking in very well. And they were not about to enter very willingly. Let's take a look, just read the story. At that time, the disciples came to Jesus saying, Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? Which one of us is the greatest? And he called a child to himself and set him before them and said, Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. What? Thank you. Whoever then humbles himself, God, quite a reaction there. Whoever then humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And he took a child and he said, there, there, there. You guys want greatness? There you go. There it is. Take a look. In this child are the necessary ingredients for greatness and competence in the kingdom of God, which you so desperately want. But right now, you need to understand that you do not possess those qualities. As this scene is just being constructed in your own mind, and you're kind of putting it together what it must have looked like. Understand this, that children in this culture were in no way revered. Their view and treatment of women in this culture was low. Of children, it was lower. To the disciples, you need to understand there was nothing quite about this scene. Oh, look at that, he brought a child. That would not have been going through them. To become like a child was a major demotion, a significant regression. Indeed, a frightening proposition, for in that culture, this child had no rights, no power, and no control. In fact, if you were an adult, one of the disciples, looking at this child, maybe not consciously, but one of the things that would have spun through your mind would have been this. I have spent most of my adult life trying to get over my childhood, and now he's calling me back to that. I'm not going there. What on earth does this mean? How does this work? What is it about this child that can teach us the ways of God, that reveal the glory of God, that can teach us greatness in the kingdom of God? Well, to answer that question, let's examine first the question that the disciples ask. For the question reveals some things about them and explains to us why it is Jesus answered the way he did. Reveals at least two things. The first is this. This question they ask reveals that they, like most of us, are born performers. strivers and competitors. You see, they got their sense of value and meaning the old-fashioned way. They earned it. Where do I get that? Well, here's where I get it. You see, when you ask a question like, who is the greatest in the kingdom, what's behind that question is this, how am I doing? How does my performance look to you? Am I doing well? In fact, am I better than them? Who's the greatest? We're all kind of great. We're all doing a kingdom thing, but who's doing it, you know, the best. Second thing the question reveals is that they were keeping track. You see, these disciples were not just coming to Jesus asking a theological question about what greatness in the kingdom looked like. That would have been a legitimate question and would have been a good discussion as they would have discussed what greatness really was. The fact is they already had an opinion about this. Mark 9, in fact, reveals that they had been arguing amongst themselves. I think it's this? I think it's that. I think it's this quality, that quality. I think it's this person. No, no, no. I think it's that person. Tell us, Lord, which one of us is right? They were not coming to Jesus to ask a question. They were coming to him to settle an argument. Which one of us, Lord, wins the prize of being dubbed by you the greatest? We're all kind of great. We're all kind of in there doing the kingdom thing, but one of us doesn't. You know, we kind of have the corner on the thing that matters most. Tell us which one. They all thought they knew the answer. They all had their own grading system. I am quite sure they had done an inventory on each other. Some, I'm sure, thought the greatest in the kingdom was Peter. I'm pretty sure that Peter thought it was Peter. Flamboyant, decisive, up front. He's the one who, standing in a boat, seeing Jesus walking on water, said, Lord, bid me come. Nobody else said that. Jesus said, come. He got out of the boat. Nobody else got out of the boat. He walked on water. He's the one who, when Jesus said, who do men say that I am? And after everybody gave the opinions that were out there, Jesus then said, who do you say that I am? Peter said, thou art the Christ, the son of the living God. And Jesus said, of the words that came out of his mouth, flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father in heaven did. He spoke words that came from God. It's got to be Peter. But some people really knew Peter, and it couldn't be Peter. Because even though he walked on water, you also need to remember he sank like a stone. Oh yeah, flesh and blood did not reveal this to you. You speak words from God, but five minutes later, he was trying to undo the crucifixion and resurrection possibility, and Jesus to that same guy said, Get thee behind me, Satan. Peter was flamboyant. He was also inconsistent. I don't think it's Peter. I think it's John, the disciple that Jesus loved. Because love is the thing that matters most. Others would hear that and say, love is good. It's very important. But you know what? Love doesn't get much done. What we need is passion. I think it's James. James is the passion guy. He gets stuff done. Yes, no doubt, James has passion. And he gets things done. but he runs people over. In the meantime, I think it's Andrew. Oh yes, it's Andrew. Put all the other ones aside. It's Andrew who in stark contrast to fiery James and impulsive Peter, quietly and consistently just brings people to Jesus. And even as I say that, you might even have your heart drawn to one or the other. Yes, I think it is him. For the fact is this, I think we do this sometimes without knowing it. What's your grading system? Who then is the greatest in the kingdom? Some would tell you it's the missionary. Others, it's the minister. Others, it's the miracle worker or the Bible thumper, the social activist. Sometimes it's the doctrine defender. Sometimes it goes beyond individuals and it becomes our group. It's our church. You know, all the other churches are good and they're doing the kingdom and they would be called great, but you know, I really think we've kind of stumbled on what really matters. And you think that unless you've been around our church for very long. And you've been around our church long enough to know that there's some good things and some bad things, and you then maybe taste something good somewhere else, and, you know, this is a good church, but they've really got a corner on it somewhere else. Who then? You tell us, Lord, who's doing best at earning their own value, of cranking it out for themselves, who's doing the best at achieving greatness and displaying glory? We will submit to your lordship on this one because you are God who is the greatest. Jesus' answer to their question is a confrontation, one that they did not expect. It's this, unless you are converted, become different than you are, you shall not enter the kingdom. Whatever else he's saying is this, disciples, you better back up right now really fast Because the question is not, who is the greatest? Because of the spirit I sense in your question, the question you really need to ask is, who enters? By the way, who enters? I don't think so much the kingdom, but who enters into the arena of what greatness in the kingdom really is? And the answer to that question right now, you guys, is someone very, very different from you. Indeed, for you to begin to enter into the arena of greatness as greatness is measured in the kingdom of God, two things would have to happen to you, and they are both rather radical. Number one, you would need to be converted. In other words, you would need to be turned. And number two, you would need to become like this child. This is a major confrontation. Keep in mind these disciples, in terms of trying to feel how big this confrontation was, that these disciples were coming to Jesus arguing about who was the greatest, convinced that one of them was. So they're kind of coming to Jesus expecting a prize. They got a bomb. I really do believe that to really enter into the fullness of this confrontation, it would do you well to become a disciple. Imagine yourself being there and hearing Jesus' words. How do you think they would respond? Well, given the circumstances and the nature of their question, I think their first response had to be shock quickly followed by an instinctive desire to correct Jesus and to clarify their question maybe this wasn't said out loud but in their hearts and probably in Peter's, in fact if anybody did it I would have seen Peter doing this, Lord, Lord, excuse me, you don't get it, you probably didn't hear the question that we really asked, see we didn't ask who enters I mean, I know you're God and it's probably very tiring being God, so you didn't hear really well. We didn't ask who enters, we asked who's the greatest. So answer that question. Being the born performers that they were, I'm quite sure that they began in the back of their minds to catalog all the right behaviors they did and correct beliefs they had to prove that they were great in the kingdom. Certainly had entered the kingdom. I mean, after all, Peter walked on water. did. No, but he did. And all of us have cast out demons. I don't even know if you know that, but by Matthew 18, they had already been given authority to do the works of the kingdom and cast out demons. And they had experience. They had cast out demons. We declared your deity. I mean, nobody else here believes that you are God, and we're telling everybody you are. I mean, we're the people. We've preached your kingdom. When you said get in the boat, we got in the boat. When you said get out of the boat, we got out of the boat. We have followed you. Man alive, if we haven't entered into the arena of greatness in the kingdom of God who on earth has. And Jesus took a child and placed it in front of himself and said this, someone like this child. Now, if nothing else has been accomplished at this point of just bringing the child without any further words spoken, he at least has their attention. After the shock, I think would come confusion. A very necessary confusion. A confusion that I think all of us as God's people enter into from time to time. It's an important place to go. When your paradigms of what God has for you, expects of you, is calling you to, is confusing you. That's not a bad place to be. It's not a comfortable place to be. I think they were confused. The problem was not, I understand your point but disagree. Their problem was looking at this kid, I have no idea what you're talking about. I don't get it. So let's try to figure it out. Let's be a disciple and try to figure it out. Let's look at the kid. The Greek word paideon indicates that this child that Jesus got was not an infant. It would have been another word in the Greek if it had been an infant. He was not a child older than seven. It would have been another Greek word if it had been that it was probably a child from five to seven years of age, somewhere between kindergarten and first or second grade. There was some speculation that this was Peter's kid because they were in Capernaum and at Peter's house, so that is a possibility. So we're looking at him and we're wondering, what are the qualities of this five-year-old child that we need to have? Well, what would you see? If we had a five-year-old kid up here, what would you see? You know, a few weeks ago, we had our little kids' choir come up, and they all came up, and they were about that age, maybe even a little younger than that. And whatever else, I mean, what did you see? Whatever else you saw, you saw cute. They were cute. Well, maybe that's it. If you could convert it and become cute. They certainly were cute. This kid, I'm sure, was cute, but there's also this possibility it was Peter's kid, so... I mean, he could have been scrawny and dirty and picking his nose, and he couldn't sense. He said, still, I have no idea what it is about this kid we're supposed to be like. Maybe it's behavior. So let's think about this. Let's look at this kid. How do five-year-olds behave? We have four kids, my wife and I. They're older now. Our youngest is 16. But I remember five very well. And all four of our kids at five years of age obeyed, listened, believed, submitted, shared their toys, were selfless and appropriate. And my four kids at this age gathered daily around our feet, looked adoringly at us, wondering what gems of wisdom they were going to receive from us that day. Every day it happened. just like the pictures that we have of Jesus with children quietly gathered at his feet just always just sitting there not moving around like five year olds do I'll say what if it was your kid I mean right in the service we were sitting here and made the mistake of sitting in the front row with a five year old and I said hey bring them up here and they were going to come up here and not just come up here but be the example of greatness in the kingdom some of you parents might go pick mine yes pick mine most of you however again just giving a five year old would be more like okay you'd feel trapped and you'd go okay let him go and while the whole illustration was going on if not really at least inside you'd be going like this tell me when it's over because the fact is this they probably wouldn't be bad they'd just be a kid they'd wave and wander, pick their nose, scratch whatever it is that itched, grab the mic, spit up, burp, and if they even got the slightest clue that what they were doing was getting attention, they would do one of two things. They would either be terrified and shut down, because I think it would be a pretty scary thing to stand up here in front of all of you, and every time they made a move, you would react. Some of them would be terrified, and mothers and fathers would want to come and rescue their kids, so that wouldn't be good. Or, when this little five-year-old kid realized that everything they did and every move they made got a reaction from you, they would begin to do Elvis. I mean, they would take over. Sermon would be done. I don't know if it's their behavior. Maybe it's that in their innocence they reveal deep kingdom truth. I think we're getting warmer. They easily believe. They quickly yield. Uttering deep kingdom truths that leave you sometimes wondering when you hear them, where did they get that? Let me tell you where they got that. Flesh and blood did not reveal that to them. It came from their Father in Heaven who is even at young ages revealing His glory and His grace to our children. That is a wonderful thing. One of the gifts that Viv Halk brings to our staff meetings on a regular basis is that she comes to our meetings and shares with us the spiritual gems that come from the mouth of babes. well we are getting warmer when we see that maybe that's what Jesus is pointing to but I still think we're not there because while at times children at that age touch on and move in deep kingdom truth at other times they don't exhibiting at other times the behavior and perspective of well a five year old one minute angelic really angelic the next minute not so much and here's the deal the disciples were like that already they wouldn't have needed to be converted or changed to become angelic one minute and not so much the next for the fact is already one minute it seemed like they got it the next they didn't. One minute walking on water the next sinking like a stone. One minute speaking words that flesh and blood did not reveal the next get thee behind me Satan. They already had this five year old thing down really well. So what is it? What do kids at this age have or not have that sets them apart from the disciples? That makes them different? I already told you at the beginning of this talk that children in that culture are not highly valued, are not especially revered. So what they don't have is power. What they don't have is control. What they do not have is any capacity in their five-year-old bodies to make themselves great. Greatness isn't one of the things you put on a kid. I mean, they have potential, and great things come from their mouths, and great behavior, but greatness that's not in their capacity yet. They are vulnerable at that age. Sometimes scared, very needy, and altogether dependent. And while they may try at that age to assert their independence, Posturing self-sufficiency. Acting like my dad, my mom and dad used to tell me that when I was that age, I was the cowardly lion. That's what they used to come, I was the cowardly lion. I could handle everything, but you'd give me anything, really. That's five-year-old. I'll never forget, this is years ago, Christopher, our youngest, we were on our way to camp, I was going to speak, we brought the kids, Christopher the whole way to camp was nervous about whether he'd kind of know his place at this camp. He just needed to know he was going to be okay. and we were telling Chris you've been here don't worry you've been here as soon as you see it you're going to recognize it well we got to the camp and he did indeed recognize it and we were walking through the dorm down the hall having been settled and he was just a little bit ahead of us and he's feeling really he's feeling really large you know before we got there he was really clingy and now he doesn't need mom and dad he's going to be really big and he walks ahead of us and he says this in the hall I know this place like the back of my head yeah well you know what some of us are walking through life that way I know this I can do this kingdom thing? I know this like the back of my head. Posturing, bigger than we are. But the fact is this. Keep with the five-year-old analogy. You put a five-year-old by themselves and leave them alone. I don't even mean in the middle of the forest. Just put them in your house. Lock the doors. Leave them there by themselves for a week. In a week, they might die. You know why? Because the fundamental undeniable life reality of a five-year-old is that they are not sufficient to meet their own needs. They are not in control, and they are altogether dependent. And as it begins to dawn on the disciples that maybe that's what Jesus is talking about, there could possibly have been rising in them. Let me stop right here. Forget about them. I promise if it was me, and I am relating to this text right now, when it dawns on me that that is what Jesus is talking about in this becoming like a child, what rises in me from the core of my being is resistance. In fact, if honest, there is actually a kind of rebellion in me to that. I don't know that for sure as being their response, but quite possibly after the shock. And then after the confusion it comes clear what Jesus is talking about. There may have been resistance, even rebellion, probably not spoken. And the reason for the resistance is this. Because most of us have spent the energy of our lives becoming independent, making sure we're in control, self-sufficient, in need of nothing, getting to a place where I can authentically say, I can do this. I will do that. I won't. I, I, I. There is a problem with that. especially for the people of God who really do desire to walk in the ways of God. The problem is this that one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God among the people of God is the way of dependence on God. And it makes me wonder if one of the reasons we don't see more authentic glory in the church is because we as a church have become so competent and capable You see, we don't really need God. We are so smart and so funny and so hip and so cutting edge, so much so that we can avoid all that messy, agonizing, crying out to God, who is our only hope. We can avoid that if we move in the strength of our own arm. You see, it is possible, beloved. and it's a frightening possibility that we can procure for ourselves what looks to be the promise and provision of God without the active presence of God being involved at all. You can procure for yourself the milk and honey by the power of your physical capacity, your razor-edged wit and intellect. You can do it, but you will never know glory. you never will just so you know this battle and resistance against dependence is not a new thing it goes back in fact to the garden just a little bit of teaching here scriptures teach that in the beginning man was created in the image of God it means we are image bearers what that means is this that we are in some respects like God like God we have capacity to love to hate we have capacity to think and reason to choose and feel and relate we have personhood so does God there are the ways however in which we are not like God among them is this God is independent he needs nothing outside himself to exist he is altogether self-sufficient he is God he exists like this needs nothing else I have not been created that way and neither have you we were created for dependence and in this place of dependence on God drawing our life from God is where we are going to experience the fullness of our humanity now in the rebellion that was in the garden when man rebelled against God the rebellion I don't think at the core was a rebellion that said I don't like God I don't want God I hate God it wasn't that it was more that the promise or the seduction of Satan was, you know what? You can be like God. And one of the ways you can be like God is you can be self, you can get independence. The rebellion was against dependence, among other things. And man got that. And now they're over here, independent, self-sufficient. I like it over here. And now I can even do things for God. And everything I do, I'll say, is for the glory of God. But it's not coming from God. It's coming from you. Throughout the ages, this fundamental sin is repeated over and over again. In Jeremiah 2 verse 13, God to the people of God said this, I have two sins against you. The first is this, you have forsaken me, the fountain of living water. You have forsaken this position of dependence and you have gone over here to dig your own wells. that hold no water. Isaiah 50 verse 11 says the same thing a different way. You guys are in darkness and you know it. But instead of coming to me and living dependently on me for the light that you need, you built your own fires. You went over here, you built your own fires, and you tried to warm yourself with what you could create by yourself. Here's the problem with that. When we dig our own wells, they don't hold much water. For the wells that we dig leak, and when we build our own fires, they don't provide much light. But if you build your own fire and you dig your own well, you are by that now kind of stuck with and limited by the water that your self-generated well can provide. By the light that your self-generated fire can establish. Question. Can you exist that way? Can you exist by digging your own wells and lighting your own fires? Yeah, you can exist. Could you start a ministry by the strength of your flesh? Yes. Could you build a church? Absolutely. Could you do your life that way? No doubt about it. But can you experience glory that way? Never. Never. Never. Why? Because one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the way of dependence on God. And the truth is that most of us are working real hard not to need God. We will put praise the Lord, glory to God, words all over the things we crank out ourselves. But most of us work really hard not to need God. so what do we do how do we break through this resistance that all of us have to living dependently on God well the text says Matthew 18 verse 4 humble yourselves like this child and you will enter into greatness in the kingdom well how do you humble yourself well you just do it so ready we'll do it on the count of three one two three be humble ready go well the truth is the best we could get relative to humility by responding to a command to be humble is that if you all started acting humble and basically you could kind of put humility on like a little code and you could go, oh, hello, yes, it's not me, it's just God. And the best you could do would be acting humble. And you know what? I'm not going to go into it further than that, but instinctively in your guts, you've all been around somebody. You couldn't even put words on it. They act humble, but you know what? They're not humble. Their humility is part of their arrogance. It's like one of the other things they do to be arrogant about it. Ugh, eh, eh. I am convinced and have been for years that true humility cannot be faked. And almost always, true humility comes as a natural result of painful brokenness. Well, how do you get broken? Well, sometimes God brings it to you. But how about starting here? How about asking God, even this morning, to do something in you audacious like this? Lord, help me see my sin and my hopelessness to do anything about my sin. I promise you. Anybody who even gets a glimpse of their sin and then their hopelessness to undo their sin or pay back their sin, there's nothing they can do, but you know what they come up hungry for? amazing grace, and they come up willing to be dependent on God for their forgiveness. How about coming to God and asking Him for this, Lord, help me see all the ways in which I light my own fires and don't even know I'm doing it. Help me see all the ways in which I dig my own wells and I'm just absolutely convinced this is coming, but it's generated by me. I'm trying to do it for you, but it's generating. Help me see those things. Help me see all the ways in which I act independently of God, sometimes in the name of God, I promise you that if he even gives you and me a glimpse of all the ways we do that, we will come up broken. And we will come up mourning. And we will come up aware that our only hope is God. And in that place of dependence, you will begin to taste glory. Maybe for the first time. But it's kind of scary. and often hurts because it comes when something's been, something that we've been leaning on gets pulled out from under us. Why is it that way? Because here's why. Because one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is dependence on God. It all began when Moses made this request. Teach me your ways that I may walk, that I may know you. If that is your request, If you joined us a couple of weeks ago when we started with this question, what are the ways of God? Teach us your ways. If that is your request, then understand this, that in answer to that request, He will call you and draw you into sometimes frightening places of dependence on Him. Because dependence on God is one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God. I'd like you to stand as we're dismissed. Father, our request this morning is this. Teach us your ways. And one of your ways is this. With no small amount of trepidation, we invite this very dynamic into the life of our body on our journey of faith because we want to know your ways and we want to experience your glory and we want to consistently know the manifested presence of God. Bring to us whatever it takes to consistently live in dependence on you because it's one of your ways that reveals your glory and that's what we want. Pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
