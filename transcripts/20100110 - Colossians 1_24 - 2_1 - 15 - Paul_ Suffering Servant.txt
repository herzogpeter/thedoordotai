For words of life that call forth life, born from your word, empowered by your spirit, to the glory of the Father, in the name of the Son, I pray. Amen. You have your Bibles open them with me to the book of Colossians. We are still in the first chapter, but picking it up today, the 24th verse, we read these words through verse 29. It's an amazing section, actually. You might call it Paul's personal mission statement. Starts with these words, verse 24. Now, I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh, in my physical body, actually, I do share on behalf of his body, which is his church, and filling up that with his which is lacking in Christ's affliction, and filling up that which is lacking in Christ's afflictions, which is a reference, let me just clear this up quickly, not to the insufficiency of Christ's suffering and death on the cross, as if Paul's suffering brought to completion somehow, something that Christ's suffering didn't or couldn't indeed. Back in verse 22, just a couple of verses previous to what I just read, Paul says this about Jesus' suffering and death unequivocally, yet he has now reconciled you completely. In his fleshly body, yes, through his suffering and death, in order to present you before God the Father, holy and blameless, beyond reproach. So when in verse 24, the apostle Paul talks about his sufferings, filling of that which was somehow lacking in Christ, what he's actually speaking to here. and we need to get this in order to enter into it ourselves, is what Paul later in, not later, but in a different epistle that he wrote kind of at the same time, Philippians chapter three, he calls it the fellowship of Christ's suffering. A fellowship, a partnership, if you will, with God through Christ that willingly chooses the path of suffering like Christ willingly did when he went to the cross in order that others might be reconciled to God. which is what Jesus did. He suffered in order that he would be able to present us to God. Paul is kind of saying, I'm entering into that same kind of thing so I can do the same kind of thing. And so he was willing to suffer and suffer, he did. Paul, in a variety of ways, there was a cost to what he did, to what he cared about. 2 Corinthians 11 speaks of it a bit. He kind of shares some of his experience. He talks of imprisonments and labors, beaten times without numbers. Five times I received the 39 lashes, he said. I thought of that this morning as I went over my notes again. Five times, 39 lashes. One time, 39 lashes. You wouldn't see me again. I think I'd go down, and I think, you know, after one of these imprisonments or labors or beatings, I think I'd come up pretty angry and bitter at God, going, I deserve, well, what do I deserve? this. I'm a king's kid. I thought I was going to get first class seats. See, when I signed on for this, five times 39 lashes, three times beaten with rods, three times I was stoned. He speaks of labors and dangers and many sleepless nights. And then apart from all of that, he says in 2 Corinthians 2.8, just look at this one. On a part of all of those other things, here's my life. There is this daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches, including Colossae. Back to the text, verse 25, and of this church I was made a minister. Minister there is an interesting word, is diakonos. Minister sounds kind of important. I'm the minister. The Greek word there is diakonos, it's servant. And of this church that I carry in my heart, says Paul, I was made a servant, according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God, that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been made manifest to his saints, to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. And here's the mystery, Christ in you, the hope of glory, and we proclaim him. That's my whole life, Paul says, to proclaim him. This is not just preaching here. This proclaiming him can be done in a variety of ways. Here's how I do it. Admonishing everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom that we may be able to present everyone complete in Christ. Get that one again. His passion, to be able to present men and women complete in Christ, which actually, and you need to connect the dots here, is another way of Paul saying, I have made Christ's mission my mission. Because everything Christ did, including his suffering, was done in order that Christ would be able and be empowered to reconcile people to God. And remember this word again that came in verse 22? Christ's suffering empowered him to present people to God, holy and blameless, beyond reproach. Paul is saying, in effect, that's my whole life too. Everything I do, from the admonishing to the teaching to the proclaiming, is in order that I might be able to present to God, there's that word in verse 28, everyone I possibly can complete in Christ. So Jesus did what he did, including suffer, in order to present people to God. And Paul is saying, it's what I want to do. I want to do the same thing. And all of that is why, Paul says, I labor, verse 29. And for this purpose, I also labor. Greek word there is agonizomai. Steve unpacked that for us a few months, maybe weeks ago. now, agonizomai is a Greek word that means agony. It speaks to agony. So for this purpose, I enter into willingly a kind of agony, striving according to the power which so mightily works within me. That's God in me, empowering me to do these things, Paul says. Chapter 2, verse 1, he continues to speak of this great struggle. Same word, agonizomai, he has on their behalf. Sounds like a horrible life. You've got to go back then to verse 24. I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake. I accept them. Don't like them, but I accept them with joy. Now, this theme, this connection between suffering and joy is one that runs consistently through all of the scriptures. We have spoken of it before here at Open Door. We will undoubtedly speak of it again. we are speaking of it today. James chapter 1 verse 2. The apostle James says this, something that just sounds so counter to our way of thinking, particularly to our culture, even the evangelical culture that many of us live in with these expectations if you follow Jesus. It's just going to be so wonderful. You'll be healthy and wealthy. Consider it all joy when you meet various trials. Consider it joy. Put it in the joy column when you meet, not if, but when you meet various trials, sufferings. Matthew 5, verse 12, one of the first things Jesus said to his young disciples as they were beginning to follow his way of living and loving, he says, listen, you guys, rejoice and be glad when you are persecuted. And they all said, what? When you're persecuted for my sake, rejoice and be glad. But this connection between suffering and joy is illustrated and embodied most clearly in Christ himself. I like to say it like this. He's the one who started this. Although, who for the joy, it says in Hebrews 12, verse 2, Jesus, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, so for the joy, Jesus, who started this whole thing, endured the suffering. Indeed, he chose suffering for joy, but not just his joy, ours. and there's this connection between suffering and joy. It's all through the scriptures. A couple of weeks ago, we celebrated Christmas and as you know, one of the primary themes of Christmas is joy. We sing, one of my favorite songs at Christmas is joy to the world, which on a personal level, when I think of joy, it might not mean much more, particularly at Christmas, than getting what you really want for Christmas. That would be joy. Or being able to give what you really want, because that's joy, too. Or family and friends and food and celebrating in some way, because it's all joy. And it really is. And I hope it was joy for you. Because for most of us, myself included, joy is almost always associated with and contingent upon. It is connected. If you're going to connect joy to something, it's usually not suffering you connect it to. If you get connected to something, we generally connect it to some idyllic scene. And it doesn't make anything wrong with us. But it is the kind of scene you might see in a Thomas Kinkade painting with sleigh bells and snow and serenity and joy. Nothing wrong with that. But the fact is this, that none of that Christmas joy that we celebrate came, none of it came without a price, a cost, some suffering. Because as we've talked about before, what was really going on that first Christmas morning wasn't sleigh bells and snow. It was a war. It was a life and death struggle with all eternity hanging in the balance. No sleigh bells, no Santa, no idyllic scenes of snowfall and serenity because in the kingdom of God, while there really is joy, inexpressible and full of glory to be had, that joy in the context of the kingdom almost always comes at a very high price through a conflict of some kind, from a battle of some sort, a battle that is being waged eternally, even now, for the hearts and the minds and the souls of men and women. God wins the battle. This is the story. And because God wins the battle, there's the joy to the world. But that battle and that victory and that joy is costly and messy and bloody and disturbing. Connected in weird ways is this joy to suffering. A couple of years ago, I did a sermon. Actually, it's kind of my favorite take on the whole Christmas story. I called it Christmas Revelation Style. I don't know if you remember that. What it is, it was kind of a way to kind of bust through all of this, you know, Christmas looks so serene. And even those of us who kind of know that Jesus is the reason for the season, rhymes, because it's not sleigh bells and it's not Santa, it's Jesus. We have these little manger scenes that are just so wonderful, and even those are just silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is calm. All is bright. But then Revelation gives us, and I just love it, because you get this kind of behind-the-scenes glimpse of what was really going on, of what that first Christmas morning really cost, actually, in order for all this joy to be. Revelation 12, verse 1. I love this. It says it all started this way. This is Christmas, actually. It all started when a great sign appeared in heaven, Revelation 12, verse 1. It says a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet, and on her head was a crown of 12 stars. And she was with child, and she cried out, being in labor and in pain to give birth. Verse 5, and she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule and to redeem and to restore the nations. Now, many of you know, because we actually, several years ago, we taught the whole book of Revelation, and I know you remember all of that. But when you're dealing with the book of Revelation, we're dealing with what we came to understand as apocalyptic language. It's symbolic language, some of which is obvious. Like in the verse I just read, the male child born to the woman who would rule the nations is obviously speaking to Christ or of Christ. The woman giving birth in the largest sense actually is actually Israel from whom the Messiah, from whom the Christ would come. more specifically, as it transpires like in history, it's actually Mary herself who is the woman. Revelation 12, verse 3, picks it up with this, that there was another sign also in heaven that first Christmas morning, and behold, a great red dragon appeared. This is obviously Satan having seven heads, ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems. Middle of verse 4, and the dragon stood before the woman. Interesting picture. The dragon standing before the woman who's about to give birth so that when she gave birth, he might deliver, he might devour, rather, her child. And then the first six words of verse 7, and there was war in heaven. So here's how it works. On earth, away in a manger, silent night. O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie in heaven a war. A war. Very high cost. with a woman about to give birth to a child who will rule and redeem and restore, and a dragon waiting to pounce as soon as it is born to devour it. And when the child is born, Satan, as it were, does pounce, but it's embodied, this pouncing of Satan is embodied literally in a guy named Herod. And his jealous paranoia, like a puppet of Satan himself, Herod has all the male children in the region slaughtered, thinking that in the slaughter he would kill the Christs. So he pounces, but he misses. The child escapes, and there's your joy. But what a price. In real time, in Jesus' day, thousands of innocents, babies, die. Matthew 2.18 says, Another voice was heard that day in Ramah, but the voice was not one of joy. Joy to the world. Weeping and mourning was the voice that was heard. Rachel weeping for her children beyond consoling because they were no more. And it's not the last time Satan pounces, desiring to devour the Christ. And it's not the last time that he misses because he pounces and he misses again at the cross, Satan the dragon. At the death of Christ, thought this time he had him for sure. He was dead. Jesus was buried in Ephesians 4 verse 9. It says this, that when Jesus died, he descended, remember this, into the lower parts, which most scholars believe is a reference to Hades or to hell, most believe, where he tasted death for every man with the sin of the world on him. And for three days, the way I've pictured it in my mind, with Jesus in the grave, having in his spirit descended to the lower parts, Satan was dancing a jig. He had finally devoured the Christ. But it says in Ephesians 4, verse 10, that the one who descended ascended. ascended for God in Acts 2.24, raised him up again, putting an end to the agony of his death. And as Christ left that hell, it says in 1 Peter 3.19, that he made a proclamation as he was leaving that hell and God was raising him from the dead. 1 Peter 3.19 says he made a proclamation to Satan and the demons. And the proclamation, I think, is this. I usually say this for Easter, but we're breaking it out today. What he said, I think, was this, I win, you lose, bye-bye. And he blew open the gates of hell, and there's your joy. But the joy is connected to incredible suffering. Who for the joy, he endured the cross and the hell and the sin, despising the shame. What would that have been about? Well, the shame of being on a cross. Only criminals went to the cross. But the shame of feeling every betrayal and every sin of you and me. I don't care about that. I'm going to do this for joy. and so did Paul he did the same thing he entered into the same pattern of life Paul who in Colossians 1.24 our text today could authentically say I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake if what it means is that we can in fact present you to God complete in Christ verse 29 for that purpose I will joyfully agonize in my labor and strive even suffer for your sake for your joy, all of which finally brings me to the message. All this before was just yelling, blah, blah, blah. Because the message actually this morning isn't what I would call a message. It's centering around a question born of this text. And the question, I think, is a disturbing one. It is for me, and it could be a life-changing one because this question is designed to pull all of us into this story that we see played out in Jesus, and we see played out in Paul, and we see played out in Scriptures, beyond gratitude, that Jesus was willing to endure suffering for our joy, for our benefit, and beyond admiration, that Paul was willing to do the same. The question this morning is this. What would I be willing to suffer? What would we, as a church, I think there's a question that we really need to visit once in a while. As a church, as a church, what would we be willing to suffer for other people's joy, for other people's benefit? Beyond mere inconvenience, and even beyond the kind of suffering that naturally comes in the course of life. Because suffering is part of life. When James, in James 1 verse 2 says, consider it all joy when you meet various trials. the various trials he's speaking of there are just the kind of suffering things that happen because life happens. What I'm talking about this morning is choosing to do something for which you may pay a very high price. Choosing to do something for which you may suffer in order that someone else may be healed, in order that someone else may be helped or housed or fed or clothed or redeemed. So what would you be willing to suffer for someone else's joy? It's called redemptive suffering. It's actually the technical term for this. And as we've seen it embodied in Christ for the joy, And we've also seen it embodied in Paul, who in Colossians 1 says, I rejoice in my sufferings. We're invited into this as well. In a number of places in Scripture and in a number of ways, one most clear is by Paul himself in Philippians 2, verse 5, where the invitation for us to enter into this is quite explicit, where he says in that text, have this attitude in you. Philippians 2, verse 5, which was also in Christ, because he's the one who started it, who although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but he emptied himself, becoming obedient unto death, even death on the cross. Indeed, in Philippians 3, verse 10, Paul kind of personifies this thing and applies it to himself as he kind of gives, it's like the Philippian version of the text we're in right now because he's in Philippians 3, verse 10, he's kind of sharing the passion of his heart, and this is my passion. This is my mission statement for life. I want to know him, and I want to know the power of his resurrection, and I want to know the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings. Not just sufferings that came to me because life is hard, but sufferings that I chose for other people's joy and other people's healing and other people's help and redemption and other people's benefit. I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake. Now, I love this picture in Philippians 3, verse 10 of the fellowship. We've talked about it before, and it's vivid in my mind. I hope there's a way I can recreate it in yours so you just never forget it. Even when you do forget it, it somehow is able to recreate itself in your mind because it needs to be recreated from time to time. And this picture I have of the fellowship is part of what stirs in me desire for this kind of life because I don't always desire this kind of life. So I need to get a picture again once in a while because this word fellowship literally and simply refers to a group of people. Picture it like this who, because of shared experiences and common passions, are in the fellowship. One of the ways I've explained it to you in the past is I kind of see these things that happen from time to time at football games. At the halftime of a football game, they'll have maybe a ceremony where they're honoring a particular group of old players who symbolize an era of excellence and success. And those players, as they're kind of walking out on the field at halftime, and all the people are cheering for them, they are in a fellowship. They have a fellowship. And in the fellowship of those players who went through those things together, there is a knowing of what they did and what it cost them to do what they did that others can only look at and admire and cheer for. And it doesn't make them bad that they're not in the fellowship, but they just don't know what it was like to play because they didn't do it. When that fellowship gathers, among the things they do, I think, is this, they sit around and tell stories of what it felt like to play and what it cost to play. And if you didn't play, you don't have any stories to tell. You might admire the fact that they did it. You might even cheer. You might, on the other hand, not understand why they like to talk about this stuff. These pitiful old guys, they talk about their old. But here's the deal, you don't understand it because you don't know. That's why you don't understand it. Why they talk and talk about what they did and what they shared together. See, here's the deal, and this may sound weird at first, but it's important, I think. The only opportunity any of us will ever have to willingly choose suffering for someone else's joy, for someone else's healing or housing or hope-giving or redeeming, the only opportunity we will ever have to do that is this side of eternity. Because obviously on the other side of eternity, there's no more suffering, not even for joy. But there will be a fellowship, a fellowship of ordinary men and women just like you and just like me, who in a variety of ways, in their marriages and families and communities and churches and friendships and workplaces, said in ways they didn't even know they were saying, because they didn't always use words. What they said by how they lived was this, I will go and I will give and I will serve and I will care. And I will suffer if I have to for other people's joy. Sometimes for my kids or my spouse or my friends. Well, the Apostle Paul will be there, no doubt, in this fellowship. And in the fellowship, again, I think we'll be doing. People who are in the fellowship do. Like old army buddies who went through the war, you start telling stories of the things you suffered for joy. But like a lot of old army buddies, Most of you will be too shy to tell your story with a tendency most of you will have to discount any price you paid, any sacrifice you made. And I put these things together in my mind, so I'm not sure it's exact, but I really do think in heaven there's gonna be this kind of thing. And because people will be shy, oh, you wanna know what I did? There won't be that. So we'll tell stories about each other. That's what I think it's gonna look like. Because we were there, and we saw. And we'll tell stories about people that we knew, and we'll just kind of, you know, we saw how much it cost you to stay in that marriage. See, we were there. You should shut up, everybody. I want to tell you about my friend over here and my friend over there. Because, see, I was there, and I saw what it costs this couple to raise that child who was sick from the first day they got him. And see, I was there and I saw what it costs these people over here to care for their aging parents when they came to that time in their life where the roles were reversed because now the kids are changing their parents' diapers and so normal and natural the other way. But now the roles are reversed and we just watched how you carried that. and when you were helping your parents through that last phase of their life, they weren't very grateful. See, we were there and we saw how much it cost you to love that neighbor, to work with those kids for all those years, to love that person who never loved you back and never said thanks. I think of parents and teachers and coaches and counselors and people, Lots of ordinary people who often, at great personal expense, literally give themselves away. And trying to create environments where other people can live and learn and grow and succeed and sometimes provide just a glimmer of hope. Philippians 129. Paul says something there that sounds really strange to us, quite foreign to us. Until you begin to unlock the treasure of what I'm talking about today, this thing of redemptive suffering. Because in Philippians 1.29, it says this, For to you it has been granted, as if you get this special gift, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake. Lucky you! Well, let me try to unpack that in ways that maybe you can understand the lucky you, the granted to suffer for his sake. What a gift. Weird thing. See, one day, an angel came to a young girl named Mary. And that angel said to Mary, somehow, Mary, blessed are you among women. And blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. For to you it has been granted. Same word. as Paul uses in Philippians 1. For to you it has been granted to have the life of God come to you, to be planted inside of you and grow in you and then come from you. It has been granted this wonderful gift. But if this life comes to you, this way you will suffer. Because this life in you, and I love the analogy, the picture of this, because in one way it's being borne out physically in Mary's body, But it's the journey that every one of us go on when we say yes to God. I want your life. Christ in you, the hope of glory. I want that life in me. Well, if that life comes to you, that life will stretch you. It will grow in you. It will change you. Sometimes it will hurt you. It will keep you up at night. It will mark you. Women know about the marks of giving birth. It's on their body. Her response, you know her response. We talk about it every Christmas. Be it done unto me. Just as you said, which means, and she wouldn't have never used these words, but what it means is she chose suffering for joy. But it wasn't just her joy. I think she experienced some joy, even through what she had to suffer to carry this child. But she carried that not just for herself. She did it for other people's joy. Joy to the world. Well, Mary's in the fellowship. And I'm here to tell you, so are many of you. Though most of you who are, again, would in fact tend to discount it. I mean, when I was doing this text this week and just getting into the tenacity of Paul, I mean, the first, I'm no Paul. And you'll say the same thing, I think. I'm no Paul, I'm no Mary. You live ordinary lives. You know, we were talking about this at Message Team on Wednesday. And just kind of the sense of this, of giving yourself away for other people's joy and kind of sacrifice and how central that is to the gospel of the kingdom and life with Christ in the kingdom and how, you know, little we see it, blah, blah, blah. And, you know, the question came up, where are the heroes? Where are the heroes? Because this is a heroic life. This kind of life. And Stephan, he said, you know, the thing about the heroes is you don't always see them because they don't always know themselves that they're heroes because they're just kind of doing their life. So I think of women, and maybe it's because of this Mary analogy, I think of mothers who physically, in a very tangible way, say yes to suffering for joy when they give birth to a child. I think of my wife, who not only said yes to that process of giving life to a child, she said yes to it four times. So I think of her, but I think of her because to this day, in ways our kids sometimes really do see, because they're old enough now to get it, but sometimes they still don't see. my wife enters into things and carries things and feels things and suffers things for those four kids. And she does it for joy. But not for hers. She does it for theirs. She's in the fellowship. She'll have stories to tell. But her kids will tell the stories, not her. She won't say a word. I know my wife. one of the great unseen ministries of any healthy church is the ministry of intercessory prayer not because it's unseen but because of what true intercessors carry what what they feel what they see if you're an intercessor you know if god is calling you into ministry of intercession you maybe need to hear this because you may be a little confused by by why it's so hard to enter into some of this stuff sometimes because people who are true intercessors, who intercede on behalf of the church, who intercede on behalf of people that they love and sometimes don't even know, they intercede. You experience things that are disturbing. There are times intercessors, you can wake up in the middle of the night and you can't sleep. You don't know why. You carry things. You feel things. You suffer things. you're in the fellowship I'm just telling you maybe nobody here even knows your name you're in the fellowship and one day you'll have stories to tell but other people will tell the stories not you because where are the heroes there's one right over there and there's one right over there but you didn't even know you were a hero because you were just doing your life and it didn't feel heroic at all I love what Paul I love what Paul says to Timothy in 2 Timothy 2.3 because it's just so counter to our culture today in America even in the evangelical church and how we would even get people to sign on to follow God you know kind of the message not everywhere but there's this you'll be a winner and you're healthy wealthy Oh, yeah, great. Okay, good. Come join me. Be successful. Good. Literally, in 2 Timothy 2.3, it's his recruitment speech for this young guy. He says, Timothy, come suffer hardship with me. Let's do it together. And I think, how would we sell that? Who would sign on for that? Come suffer hardship. Come on. Ready? Ready? You want to follow? Okay, come on. who would sign on for that? Well, if Paul were here, he would say, I did sign on for that. And I would do it again. And I would do it for joy. See, the message today isn't really a message as such. It really boils down to a very simple question. And the question is this, what would I? what would we be willing to do be willing to endure be willing to suffer for other people's joy for other people's benefit and then out of that question out of that question begin to wonder what would it mean for our marriages what would it mean for our families and our church for this community Maple Grove where we live for the local high school what would it mean for the homeless shelter for the least and the lost in our city, if ordinary people, just ordinary people like you and like me would begin to say, I want to be part of the fellowship. Of people who, like Paul has said, without words necessarily, I will go and I will give and I will serve and if it comes, I will suffer if need be for other people's joy. What would that mean? Well, the fact is, I know exactly what that would mean because that would mean joy. Joy. To our marriages and to our families, that would mean joy to this community and to the local high school and to the homeless shelter and to the least and the lost in this city, it would mean joy to the world. And all of that is why Paul could authentically say, this is not just religious language for him, he could authentically say, Colossians 1, verse 24, now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake. and in my flesh, in my body, bear things willingly in order that we might be able to present people to God and reconcile people to God. I'll do it for joy. How about you? How about me? How about us? Good question. Well, let's pray. Would you stand with me as we close? you know last night the prayer team kind of instinctively took their place to meet people for prayer I didn't even ask them so when I saw them I thought that's a good idea so I'm going to ask the prayer team to make themselves available for people who want to come for prayer for anything at all this morning well let's pray father just pray you take this this word this question and and help us just see it again and hear it again and get back on the screen of our minds and our spirits this fellowship. And I pray especially for those who are paying a really high price and they don't see the benefit at all right now. There's no joy in it right now. That's the hardest place to be. Pray to come and minister to men and women who are giving things, they're giving pieces of themselves away to things that really matter, but they don't see that joyful peace at all. Holy Spirit, come. Minister your life, your hope. Minister of vision, of life in the kingdom, of partnering with you in ways that they would tend to push away of being a lot like Paul. I pray these things be vividly real among us and I pray in Jesus name Amen Thank you.
