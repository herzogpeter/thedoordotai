We are coming today to the eighth and final sermon in a series dealing with the Olivet Discourse, chapter 24 and 25 of the book of Matthew. As most of you are aware of the fact this particular discourse that Jesus gives is taking place in the final week in the life of Christ. In fact, we've been in it so long that we've probably lost touch with the fact that it was just on this same day that the discourse is happening that Jesus was in the temple with that incredible confrontation upon the Pharisees and their religious system that was shutting off the kingdom from people who were trying to enter. On that same day, Jesus then moved into the Olivet Discourse, revealing the events of his second coming. This discourse was precipitated by a question that the disciples had asked Jesus in chapter 24, verse 3. The question was twofold. First of all, Jesus, what will be the sign or the signs of your second coming? And secondly, when will your coming be? In chapter 24, verse 4 to 31, Jesus began to reveal to them and to us what the signs of his coming would be. And then secondly, in verse 32 to 41, he began to deal with the when of his coming. And the answer to the when was fundamentally this. Nobody knows. I don't know, said Jesus. The angels in heaven don't know. Only the Father himself. Therefore, verse 42 of chapter 24 said this, because of the fact that we do not know the day or your day, meaning your death or the day of the Lord, either one of those things, he then moved in in verse 42 to 51 a series of warnings, and they were simply this, because we don't know the day or the hour that Jesus will come or that we will die, we need to be alert, we need to be ready, we need to be faithful, literally, we need to be full of faith. And all of those things were simply saying the same thing. We need to be redeemed. Because if we're redeemed and the Spirit of Christ lives within us and we have been made new creatures in Christ, it doesn't matter when he comes because we will be what? Ready. So be ready. Be faithful. Be alert. As we entered into chapter 25 a couple of weeks ago, what we found was Jesus elaborating on and restating those three warnings with three parables. The first parable was the parable of the ten virgins. And the picture that we got was the picture of ten maidens. All of them were in the assembly. They had all come to the wedding, apparently to celebrate the wedding. They were all waiting for the groom with tremendous excitement and anticipation. They were all apparently dressed and prepared for the wedding, but there was a problem. While all of them externally seemed to be prepared for the coming of the groom, only five of them had oil that was going to keep the torch lit, and five of them did not. And that was a picture of people who come to church and come to the temple, and they appear to be prepared, and they seem to be excited about the coming of the king. But the truth is, some of them do not have the oil of the life of God. They are not truly redeemed. Some of them do, some of them don't. They look externally prepared, but they have not been made new creatures in Christ. In fact, one of the things that Jesus could well have been doing, in light of the fact that, again, this was the same day that he had just been in the temple. He could have easily interjected here, and probably the disciples made the connection themselves. It's just like the temple we just came out of, guys. The temple we just left was full of people who looked religious. They wear the garb of God. They give their money. They pray loud and long. They fast twice a week. They tithe dill and mint and cumin. But they neglect the weightier matters of the law, like love, justice, and mercy. and the reason they do that is because they don't have the oil. They don't have the genuine life of God within them. And you need to know something, the disciples, that the kingdom of God is like that. The next parable said fundamentally the same thing. Three slaves, all of them, had opportunity and capacity to enter into gospel truth. Two of them energized or linked what they knew of God's grace with faith, and therefore it bore life and a product of life. But one of them took what they knew of God and God's grace and buried it in the ground and said, Jesus will be kind of this appendage to my life. I'll kind of put it in the ground and I'll respect it and I'll kind of protect it. But it was never linked with faith and he began to be, or was for us, a picture of, a metaphor of someone who was religious but not redeemed in the point of both those things. Among other things was simply this, disciples, people at Church of the Open Door, on this day know this, that the kingdom is a mixed bag. The temple is a mixed bag. The church is a mixed bag. And in the context of the assemblage, there are wheat and there are tares. There are those who are real and there are those who are false. There are Ishmaels and there are Isaacs. There are religious and there are redeemed. There are sheep and there are goats. And that is what we're dealing with in our text today, the parable of the sheep and goats. Today, in this parable, All of this is going to be coming to kind of a culmination with a warning. And the warning is simply this. With this mixed bag, we need to be aware that a judgment is coming. With this mixed bag, we need to be aware that a separation one day will be made. And the heart of Jesus, as it relates to this warning, is not to yell at people. The heart of Jesus, in terms of the motivation for giving a warning like this, I believe, is because he is not willing that any should perish, but that all would come to repentance and all of the goats would be turned by the grace and power of Jesus into sheep. Let's read the text. Verse 31. But when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. And all the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate them one from another as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will put the sheep on his right and the goats on the left. Then the king will say to those on his right, Come, you who are blessed of my Father. Inherit a kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me in. Naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me. Then the righteous will answer and say, Lord, when did we see you hungry? I don't remember when you were thirsty, or when you were a stranger, or naked. When did all that happen? When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you? And the king will answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of mine, even the least of them, you did it to me. Then he will also say to those on his left, Depart from me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me nothing to drink. A stranger, you didn't invite me in. Naked, you didn't clothe me. Sick and in prison, and you did not visit me. And then they themselves will answer saying, Lord, when were you hungry or thirsty or naked? We would have done something. And he will answer to them saying, Truly I say to you that to the extent that you did not do it to the least of these, you did not do it to me, and these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. A passage that many of you have heard, many of you have been troubled by, many have been confused by. It is a passage that I believe is vitally important. It is a passage that contains some of the most powerful ingredients of the gospel we will ever hear. Three things I want us to focus on. First of all, we're going to deal with the fact of judgment, verses 31 and 32. The second thing is the basis for judgment, and that's really going to be the body of our study today because we need to know what is the basis of separating the sheep from the goats. And the third thing is the securing our, the finality of judgment. Let's pray as we begin. Father God I just need to ask that you would do again this service what you've done in the other two and that is provide the supernatural work of your spirit to move among us first of all for an ability with our minds to understand we need to solve some almost what appears to be riddles in this passage we need to understand what it is that you're saying what the basis of separation really is but father as we begin to understand it there comes from deep within me an awareness that that that those who would be goats among us need a miracle and it's the miracle of recreation the miracle of regeneration that they get changed from a goat to a sheep from death to life and i pray that your kingdom life would be available for that in jesus name amen let's look first of all the fact of judgment. The fact of judgment, verse 31. It really just sets the scene when the Son of Man comes in his glory, all his angels will be with him, and he will sit in his glory throne. We've seen this before. We've dealt with this before. In fact, just one chapter over, in the same context of the Olivet Discourse, Jesus, in verse 29 of that chapter 24, said this, immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be dark, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky. Revelation said it will be as if the sky is rolled up like a scroll. God's going to pull down the screen of the universe or the sky, and it's going to roll up like a scroll, and everything will be dark. But it won't be dark, because the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. Remember that? It's going to be light. It's going to be bright. It's going to be shining, and Jesus is going to literally fill the earth with his glory. And all God's people said all through that sermon, amen, amen, amen. We can't wait for that. For believers, this event that is setting the scene for us in verse 31 is a glorious time. It is the culmination. It is what Paul called our blessed hope when Jesus comes in his glory, all his angels gathering the elect. But there's a problem. Again, back in chapter 24, verse 30, the problem is even indicated there. While the saints, the redeemed, were going to celebrate at this time, we all look for this. It's a motivation for our whole life, his coming. It says also that the tribes of the earth will mourn. Nations will mourn at this same event. And the reason for that is because this event is not only going to be a celebration, it is going to be a separation. The mixed bag of wheat and tares, real and false, Ishmael and Isaac, religious and redeemed, is going to be by God, by Jesus literally, because he is going to function as the judge in this particular time. It's going to be sorted out. It's going to be separated. And the wheat, using the metaphor of Matthew chapter 13, is going to be barned, and the tares are going to be burned. And all the nations, it says in verse 32, will be gathered before him. The word nations there is simply the Greek word ethnos, all ethnic groups. All people of all time in every generation will be gathered before God. To give you kind of a piece of this chronologically, for those of you who might be even students of the end times, I think that the chronology of this is this. before the great white throne judgment. The great white throne judgment is the final judgment of all believers, of unbelievers rather, of all unbelievers. And before the judgment seat of Christ, the judgment seat of Christ is where all believers are going to go. It is the Bema seat. Remember that? We've done teaching on that. For a believer, the judgment that I am going to get is not going to have sin in view. The Bema seat is where we would go for our reward. That's going to be a place of great celebration. Before both the judgment seat of Christ and the great white throne judgment, will be this event where he will separate the sheep, those who belong to him redeemed, and those who do not. And then will be these other two judgments. Let's examine for a moment the elements of the parable. Jesus, again, in this section, heavily leaning on this method of using parable to teach spiritual truth. And we are pretty familiar with that since we've been in this for a long time, where Jesus takes a situation that would have been common physically in the lives of the original hearers and uses that common picture to paint spiritual truth. In this metaphor, sheep are obviously speaking of the redeemed. Goats are speaking of those who are not redeemed. And now he is saying there is a mingling of the two in the flock. Again, that is speaking to this mixed bag that we've been speaking of. That would be a common sight, by the way, physically, to the disciples in the land of Palestine. A flock of sheep would be a common thing, but as common as a flock of sheep would be the reality that always there were goats mixed in. They just kind of took it for granted. You couldn't avoid it. You basically had to accept it. It really wasn't worth the shepherd's time to try to move in there and always separate every single goat that ever came in. They didn't have time to do that. Every once in a while there came a time when we've got to do this separation. It's time for harvest. It's time to shear the sheep. It's time to bring a lamb for sacrifice. And now's the time we're going to move in here and do all the separation. But by and large, the goats just kind of moved along with the sheep, and it was kind of an accepted thing. You couldn't do much about it. I'm not an expert on sheep or goats, but as I just began to think a little bit about what a goat would be like in the flock and what their relationship would be with sheep, I thought, you know, goats at best, to the purposes of the shepherd, were worthless. They were worthless. They were basically benign at best. They weren't good for anything. They weren't good for wool. They weren't good for meat. They weren't good for sacrifice. I mean, you didn't hear very often of anybody bringing a spotless goat. You know, I mean, they brought a spotless lamb. And so they were just kind of there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know they're there. Their influence in the flock was not always benign. I'm sure that there were times when there would be a goat that was particularly ornery who would kind of move in there and butt some of the other sheep around and knock them about a little bit. and the shepherd would get a little upset about that. Maybe if they weren't even that ornery, they would sometimes be a significant distraction because the true shepherd has a heart for what? For the sheep. And these goats are there, and they're consuming the resources that are meant for the sheep. They're consuming the time of the shepherd that the shepherd has a heart to be with the sheep. And there's always these goats, and we're bumping into them, and it's just kind of a pain. Now, even at worst, as I was just kind of speculating on the influence, again, of goats in the flock, even at worst you wouldn't react to a goat the way you would to a wolf we've had teaching on what happens when a wolf comes into the flock a wolf being portrayed as a as a false teacher for instance and when a wolf comes we go to war remember but this is a goat i mean you know you don't hear the shepherd going oh a goat get the goat mad goat yeah you know you know you know yeah there's a goat yeah i know okay i don't have time i don't have time again and kind of go on with the metaphor a little bit more i thought you know goats are probably a lot like people just like sheep are a lot like people i'm sure there were nice goats didn't do much didn't cause any damage didn't make any noise couldn't hardly tell the difference it didn't bother them at all just leave them alone and i'm sure there were nasty goats and they kind of butted people around and made life difficult for everybody including the shepherd and i have a feeling that maybe just like the impatient slaves of Matthew 13, when the metaphor wasn't sheep and goats, it was wheat and tares, the impatient slaves came to Jesus and said, I'm really getting tired of these tares following up the works here, and it's making our work a lot harder. Can we just go in there and yank them all out so we just have wheat? And Jesus said then what he says now, no, you can't do that. For one thing, you don't have the wisdom all the time on this side of eternity to tell for sure what's a wheat and what's a tare, what's a goat, who's a goat and who's a sheep. So you just you just kind of keep your hands off that, keep feeding the flock, keep loving the flock, keep healing all of them, but know this, I am going to separate it all one day. And so your job, shepherd on earth, servant in the field, is to warn the whole flock that while I have not got the capacity to do the separation, God one day will. Every once in a while, I'll have somebody ask me a question. A lot of times it's when I meet with pastors from other churches, and I really enjoy doing that. And we just kind of share our ministries and some of our struggles and our good things and hard things, and we have a good fellowship together. Every once in a while, somebody will ask me a question like this. You know, Johnson, you know, we hear good things and God's moving. What do you think you have over there? I mean, in terms of your people, I mean, there's so many. How do you know who they are? And I say, I don't. So how do you know who they are? I don't. But I speculate this way. This is what I think we have. I think, and this is what I tell people, we have some wonderful sheep. We have people who are coming to our fellowship who love the shepherd, the chief shepherd with all their heart, and they've bent their knee to him, and they're just such gentle and caring and full of God's sheep. It's wonderful. And we've got a lot of wounded sheep, and I even think in some very significant ways, God's raising our church up to be a place where wounded sheep can come and get healed. And we've got some wandering sheep. And the fun thing about wandering sheep, the fun thing about wandering sheep is they're always different. Someday you're wandering, and then you're wandering, and then you're wandering, and then you come back, and that's wonderful, and now I'm wandering. And oh, my goodness. It's kind of like life, you know, this flock. It's just kind of life. You're all a mess. We're all a mess. We're, you know, going, oh, man. And right in the middle of it all, you know what I know about our fellowship? We got some goats. We got some goats. And now you're going, you mean we have goats? Who are they? I have no idea. I have no idea. You know, one of the wonderful things about this, I don't have to be picking on it. I honestly don't have anybody in my mind. We have a very large flock. You know what I see when I look over all of you? White. I just see a sea of white. You all look like sheep. You know, there's probably goats in there somewhere. If we don't have any goats here, we're probably the only flock ever that didn't. The kingdom's like a flock of sheep, and goats are always mingled in. Some of the goats are nice And some of them are nasty Some of them are docile And some of them are dangerous The same with sheep Same with sheep We got some baby sheep here And they need nurture And they need love And we're gonna do that for our baby We got Some grown sheep We have Some wandering sheep We've Got Some wounded We've Got Some tired We've Got Some happy We've Got Some strong and genuine shepherds always have a heart for the sheep and so every once in a while like a frustrated servant in the field of Matthew 13 there comes in the heart of everybody me from time to time Lord just move in here and get rid of the goats because sometimes I feel like we're spending time you know I'm chasing off to here wondering wandering person or thing and find out it's a goat and I want to be with the sheep so just get rid of the goats can we go in here and nail them no no no because Johnson on this side of eternity you don't have you might think you do but you don't have the capacity to look at external things you don't have the capacity even to know anybody's heart so that's not your job to separate I'm going to do that I want you to tell the flock that I'm going to do that so that they would look inside and ask some identity questions and that leads me to point number two the basis of the separation The basis of the separation. At this point, the text becomes problematic. At first glance, especially when we look at verse 35 and 36, I was hungry, you gave me something to eat. It seems that the basis of the separation was their works. It seems that the basis of separation was social action. The basis of separation here is philanthropy. That would be a dangerous thing if we move fully into that because that makes my salvation based on works. Is that true? This is a very confusing passage. The fact is this. The basis of this judgment, the basis of this separation, involves two vital ingredients. Both of them are in the text. The first basis of separation is rooted in identity. I want to say that again. The separation is based on and rooted in, first of all, on identity, not on performance. Second, however, is this, that the identity of a sheep is going to be affirmed in living. The identity of a goat is going to be affirmed in activity. Let's wade through both of those dynamics. First of all, the identity. Verse 33, and he will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. That is significant. Just stop right there. What is the basis right here of the separation. The reason some were put on the right had nothing to do in this verse with what they did. It was who they were. If you are a sheep, you go on the right. The reason some of them were put on the left hand had nothing to do at this point with what they did, but they were put on the left because of who they were. They were goats. Even the nice goats went on the left. Even the religious goats, one on the left. The primary basis, fundamental basis of the separation at the beginning was identity. Verse 34 then elaborates on that when the king says three things to the ones on the right, identified as sheep. He says, first of all, come you who are blessed of my father. Second of all, inherit the kingdom. And third of all, this kingdom was prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Come blessed of my Father. Let's look at that. Key word in this little phrase is the word blessed or blessed. The key question that we have to ask ourselves is this. Who are the blessed? Who are the blessed? Scratch your head and think about that for a minute. Have we heard this word before? Blessed. Blessed. See, we're at the end of his gospel right now, and his teaching, I would have to think, is something that he would maybe assume that we know. We have heard this before. You see, at the beginning of the gospel, he's already told us who the blessed are. He's already told us who the blessed are. You're probably already thinking of it. It's the Beatitudes. When he began his ministry in chapter 5, he began to say things like this, blessed are the performers, right? No, he didn't say that. Blessed are the strivers. Blessed are those who look good. Blessed are those who are cranking it out for themselves and trying as hard as they can to be as righteous as they can to earn their life themselves. No, he didn't say that. He came to confront that mentality because that mentality was deeply entrenched in the temple. He came and said, those are not the ones who are going to experience my kingdom or the power of my kingdom. The ones who are going to be blessed or blessed are the broken. It's going to be the mourning. It's going to be those who are hungering and thirsting for a righteousness that they have finally realized they can never crank out on their own. They can never produce themselves. And they have come to the end of themselves through brokenness, mourning, and hungering for a righteousness they can't produce where they're saying things like this, My only hope is Jesus. My only hope is grace. They are the blessed of the Father. Come, you who are the broken, mourning, hungry, inherit the kingdom, the second thing. Inherit the kingdom. Key word there is inheritance. Inherit. Key aspect of inheritance is this. You don't earn an inheritance. Think about that. The reason you get an inheritance is that it is given to you by virtue of birth. I am going to inherit the wealth of my father one day, which means I am going to get a Weber grill. Inherit the kingdom. In this case, the inheritance is by virtue of birth too. But the birth that is being spoken of here is the new birth. Being born again. Weird concept to many people. I'm afraid that some even who call themselves Christians don't understand the concept. Nicodemus, in John chapter 3, came to Jesus. Nicodemus was a ruler of the Jews. He was a religious ruler of the Jews. Would like to be an elder in a church, maybe a pastor of a church. Ask the question, Jesus, how might I inherit eternal life? Jesus did not say to him, Nicodemus, the way you inherit eternal life is by doing more religious things, by doing more nice things, by doing verse 35 things. Nicodemus, the way to inherit eternal life is to feed the hungry, quench the thirsty, visit the prisoner, invite the stranger in, and clothe the naked. He didn't say that. Nicodemus was probably already doing all that stuff. No, he said this to Nicodemus, something that was weird to him. He said, Nicodemus, you must be born again. Why do I need to be born again? Here's why. You're a goat. You're a goat. Nicodemus, using this text now on our friend Nicodemus. Nicodemus, you're a nice goat. You're a sincere goat. You're a religious goat. but you're a goat. And if I just give you more behaviors to perform, I am absolutely convinced you'll do them. But you don't need more behaviors to perform and lists to follow. What you need to realize is that you need a brand new identity, Nicodemus. That word to Nicodemus probably frustrated him. It was supposed to frustrate him, frustrate him so much that somewhere along the line, while this person was used to cranking out all the religious behaviors and telling everybody else to crank out all the religious behaviors, it would finally dawn on him that I can't turn myself into a sheep. The only chance I have of being recreated is if God does a miracle. And all of a sudden, he's ready to come to God, broken, mourning, hungering for righteousness that he finally has realized he cannot produce by cranking out behaviors. Nicodemus, the new birth is a miracle work of the Spirit that is made available to broken, mourning, hungry people who say my only hope is you. And then the miracle of 2 Corinthians 5, 17 unfolds where it says if any man is in Christ, he is a what? A new creature. The essence of Christianity is that it turns goats into sheep. It turns dead people into alive people. I want to say something just like out loud. It's something I kind of think we, I assume we know, but I'm not going to do that today. A Christian, a redeemed person, is not just someone who goes to church. It is not someone who simply recites Scripture. It is not simply someone who affirms doctrine, even right doctrine. Pharisees, beloved, knew the doctrine. Their doctrine was right. They didn't have the oil. They didn't have the life of God. When God came, they missed it, but they had doctrine up to here. They were the orthodox, the fundamental. a Christian is not just someone who does nice things a Christian is not someone who just turns over a new leaf and cleans his life up on the outside we met a guy like that in chapter 12 and after he swept out the rooms of his house in his own effort the demons came back later seven times stronger because he wasn't internally recreated the essence of Christianity is a recreated new identity a Christian isn't someone who just believes in God everybody, I mean Gallup poll 95% of Americans believe in God hallelujah well big deal, James said big deal you say you believe in God, James says good for you, you do well so do the demons picture I have, I love this I've told you this before I think another context picture junior high Sunday school class and right in the middle of this junior high Sunday school class is a demon it's not that hard to picture so we're going to do our little Sunday school thing and ask them doctrinal questions was Jesus the son of God the demon answers how yeah do you believe in the deity of Jesus demon yes do you believe that Jesus died for all the sins of the world yes I was dancing on top of the cross when it happened it was our best day do you believe that Jesus rose again from that day from that grave the third day with glory and power and honor yes I believe that too do you believe that Jesus is coming again for his church and put every, and at that point will put everything right. Do you believe that? Yes. I think demons believe in the second coming of Jesus more than some believers believe it. Does that make that demon redeemed? Well, that's the goofiest thing you ever heard. Why? Because Christianity is more than just believing even the right things. The essence definition of Christianity is by the Spirit, through our faith, being made in here a brand new person, a new creation, with a new heart and a new desire and a new identity. This inheritance speaks also of sonship. I like that. Inheritance speaks of sonship. Inherit the kingdom, son. You know, I like the metaphor of the sheep. It works for me. I can enter into feeling like a sheep. I really do love the shepherd. And I know about myself that I wander, I get my eyes off the shepherd from time to time, and I wander away, and he keeps bringing me back. And there's something about the stupidity, and I don't mean that in a beating-on-me way, but just things have to be simple for me. I was a shepherd, and I just got to kind of just go like this all the time and just keep going, you know, you're my only hope. This is it, you and me. But I'm glad there's other pictures that take me out of the realm of being a sheep. You see, I'm not just a sheep, I'm a son. and so are you your son and your daughter you know what's wonderful about that I've by virtue of the new creation the regeneration in my spirit I've been born not just of a physical seed from my physical father but I've been born according to Titus of a righteous seed he's gone that far with spiritual language to communicate a spiritual truth that somehow the seed of God like the seed of my father gave birth to me the seed of God spiritually gave birth to me and I am his son. I belong to him. That's why I look like him. That's why you look like him because you're born of him. Be therefore imitators of God just like sons. It's the most normal thing for a son or a daughter to look like their mom and dad if they're born in family. Behold what manner of love the father has given unto us that we should be called sons and daughters of God. And it's such an unbelievable comment that he restates it. He says this, and such we are. We really are. You need to know we really are. What I want you to know is that the basis of this separation is not performance, it's identity. The reason they were put on the right was because they were sheep, recreated, not goats anymore. That's why they were there. Come, you who are blessed, inherit the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world. Ephesians 1.4 says, He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world. This concept is reaffirmed by Paul there. What I love about that is it simply says this, Before God made the world, He did something more important than making the world. He chose me. Before God made the world, created the world, separated the earth from the water, He did something more important than that. He chose you and you and you and you. Verse 7 goes on in Ephesians to say, And in him we have redemption. Not in our philanthropy, not in our social action, but in him, Jesus alone, we have redemption. Through his blood, the forgiveness of sin, according to the riches of his grace, which he has lavished on us. Come, you who are blessed of my Father, blessed because in brokenness, mourning, and hunger, you came saying this, My only hope is you. Inherit the kingdom. Why? Because you're more than sheep, you're sons. How did you become a son? you became a son by the recreating, regenerating work of the Holy Spirit of God that turns goats into sheep. And your position as a son and your inheritance in the kingdom was secured by him for you before he made the world. The basis of separation is rooted in identity. Born of grace, born of faith, recreation. Point number two, it is affirmed in our living. the affirmation of the visible manifestation of this new identity God created new identity new heart the affirmation of that new identity is how we live and how we love one of the ways that helps me cut through what I mean by that is this when I think of recreation when I think of regeneration that dawns on me that the God who made the world when I became a believer in Jesus entered into my life and he has taken his residence in me. Do you suppose it's reasonable to expect that when the God who made the world with all his power and all his glory would come and take his residence within a person's life and change that person's heart that it might somehow be reflected in how they live? Do you think it might have some impact? Yes. and maybe the explanation of someone's life who has no heart for God who has no heart for moving into kingdom life is that they don't have a new heart the primary focus even now when we move into verse 35 and 36 I was hungry, you gave me something to eat thirsty, all that still even there, beloved. The focus is not on what they did, it's who they are. Let me explain that. When a sheep is just focused on being who they are, you know what happens? Here's what happens. When a redeemed person is just focused on being a redeemed person, is just focused on Jesus and hanging on to Jesus, when a redeemed person is just being redeemed, a sheep is just being a sheep, you know what happens? Here's what happens. Clothed people get clothed. Naked people get clothed. Hungry people get fed. Thirsty people get a drink. Strangers get brought near. Sick people get healed. Prisoners don't have more weight put on them. The weight gets released. It's one of the ways you can spot you're in a redeemed community. Those things happen. It's one of the ways you can spot you're with a redeemed brother or sister. It's what happens to you. You get fed. You get quenched. You get healed. You get clothed. I hope you can tell I'm not just talking physically. I think this applies physically, but far beyond that. It's a spiritual clothing, a spiritual feeding. Remember something that happened the day before these events? One of the things that happened the day before these events in this text was the cleansing of the temple. You might remember why he cleansed the temple. There was rage, there was anger. But what he did was he came to the temple and he realized as he looked at all the booths that were there in the courtyard of the Gentiles. People were coming from all over the country figuring that if there's any place in the world that I could meet with God, it would be at the temple. People do that today. They figure if there's any place in the world where I could meet with God, it would be in the church. So they come to church. But when God, Jesus, moved into this particular temple, there were all these booths, and all the booths were saying, ha, you can't get to God, not unless you buy from us, and not unless you buy from our denomination. So I'm not going to sell you Jesus. I'm going to tell you not how to be a genuine born of the spirit believer. I'm going to tell you, though, how to be a Baptist. or I'm going to tell you how to be an alliance or I'm going to tell you how to be a Catholic or I'm going to tell you how to be a Lutheran and that's what they end up going to, these little booths. And instead of being booths that give access to God, they literally hinder people coming to God and Jesus hit the roof. And he said, you have made my house a place not where people get clothed and fed and their hunger and their thirst quenched. You've made this a robber's den where people get their life stolen from them. And in his rage, the people, the Pharisees, began to scatter. And one of the ironies of that picture was right in the middle of that text. It says that after the Pharisees scattered, the blind and the lame came to him from out of the dark places in the temple. Add to that this text. Not only the blind and the lame, but the naked, the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger. They all started coming out of the woodwork in this place. And Jesus began to heal them. The observation we made at the time about that was this. That one of the ways you can spot the genuine life of Christ in a person, one of the ways you can spot the genuine life of Christ in what calls itself a church. A lot of places have the sign outside, this is a church, great. The way you can tell it's a God thing, that it's a kingdom work, the way you can spot that it's genuinely a Christian organization is not its doctrine. Let's fight for doctrine. Let's fight for right doctrine. But that's not how you tell. You know how you can tell? You can tell because in a place where I'm at work and my sheep are, this is what happens. Blind, lame, naked, hungry, thirsty, estranged, sick, in bondage people are no longer a hindrance to ministry. They are the ministry. And that's what happened when Jesus coins the temple. that came out of the woodwork and they became the ministry. Until that, they were a hindrance to the ministry and they had to stay in the corner. Beloved Pharisees, goats, are capable of religious behavior. They give, they pray loud and long, they fast, they tithe, dill and mint and cumin, but they neglect the weightier matters of the law like love, justice, and mercy because it takes a new heart to do that. Verse 38. Rather, verse 40, Jesus said, truly I say to you to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of mine even the least of them you did it unto me these naked ones are my ministry they are the ones that I care of and when I saw you minister to them you ministered to me and that indicated to me that you belong to me because you were simply doing what I did who are the least of these who are the least of these now it was interesting this week in my study to to kind of process what all the commentaries thought and what the perceptions were. And my only theory is that much of what I was reading was somehow a relatively recent, I suppose, reaction to the social gospel. And I would come against the social gospel that says all you have to do is do physical stuff and not touch the spiritual. I would be against that. But I think there was such a, what they said here was that the brothers of mine, this is speaking to being nice to other Christians. These least of these are other Christians. And that's what we need to minister. It's not about feeding the poor, really. It's not about ministering to naked people, really. It's just ministering to each other in the body. Hey, it does mean that. But it means more than that. Who are the least of these? Ask yourself this question. Who are the least that Jesus ministered to? That makes it easy for me. Who are the least that Jesus ministered to? Just Christians. There weren't any Christians. No, who Jesus ministered to? Well, he ministered to lepers. there was a leper and a blind man on the side of the road, and he walked up to them. He didn't go, Are you a Christian? I'll be nice to you. No, he ministered to them, and he saw, first of all, their physical need, and he touched their physical need. The dynamic was always that the physical healing was always a picture of spiritual healing. Spiritual healing was the ultimate. That's what we always wanted to go for. That was the physical healing, literally, in the long run, meant nothing. But in order that you might know I forgive sin, take up your bed and walk. Remember that? That's the balance. If you want to know the balance between social ministry and spiritual ministry, Look at the man in Matthew chapter 8 being dropped through the ceiling. Jesus looks at the man and does what he really wants to do. This is his ultimate agenda. He says this, your sins are forgiven. That's all I care about. That's what you really need. You don't even need to walk. But, Pharisee says, who do you think you are forgiven sin? Do I think you're God? Jesus said, yeah. And he said this. He said, in order that you might know, I do the thing that really matters, and that is the internal work of spiritual life. I'm going to touch this man physically. Take up your bed and walk. And he took up his bed and walked. Both of the dynamics were there. A physical ministry, a spiritual ministry. The physical allowed the spiritual to take root. And the way I can spot my redeemed, you know how? Because my redeemed aren't just a bunch of do-gooders. goats do good stuff. Goats can start cranking out behaviors to make themselves look like sheep. The way I spot my redeemed people is that they've been recreated. They're not goats anymore. They're sheep. And now that I live inside them, you know what happens as I start to begin to live my life in them and they simply start doing what I do. Jesus in you begins to do in and through you what he did. And all of a sudden around you, naked people start getting clothed and hungry people start getting fed and i'm gonna land on this naked piece just for a minute spiritually a real vivid metaphor came to my mind about that you know i i've never clothed anybody who was physically naked i never saw that i've never walked down the street and seen that maybe some of you have in a physical arena have had to minister to that somebody at that level i haven't but it sure connects for me spiritually what would a naked person spiritually look like well if i were to draw from the physical metaphor it'd be humiliating to be caught naked, to be humiliating. It'd be incredibly vulnerable. Have you ever met anybody spiritually naked? Spiritually humiliated, spiritually vulnerable? You want to know what happens to spiritually vulnerable, humiliated, naked people in a temple that Jesus came out of? In a legalistic system, you know what happens to them? They get pointed at, don't they? That's exhibit A of what we despise. Look at that naked, vile person. It's the publican, it's the Pharisee, rather, in Luke chapter 7, who said, Lord, I thank you that I'm not like that scumbag, naked publican over there who's beating on his chest saying, Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner. I thank you, God, that I'm not like that naked creep. You know when a spiritually naked person is around redeemed people, you know what happens to them? He gets clothed. He gets clothed. He gets clothed with grace and mercy and forgiveness and he gets to stand. And he isn't humiliated. And when he begins to mourn, he doesn't get condemned, he gets comforted. That's how you can tell you're around redeemed people because they do what Jesus did. Goats, beloved, are capable of religious behavior. In verse 44 it says, When were you hungry, thirsty? Almost implied there is there would be a willingness to do the behavior. Goats don't need another behavior to do. they need a new identity. Verse 37, back to that real quickly. The righteous, when they hear that you clothed and you fed, when did we do that? When did we do all that? There's confusion. I don't know when I did that. That's a wonderful concept. I want you to remember it. You know what it means? It simply reveals to us that the sheep's primary focus was not doing. The sheep's primary focus in verse 37 was just being. All they were doing was being a sheep. And you know what happens when sheep are just being sheep? and truly redeemed are just being redeemed and truly regenerated people are just being regenerated and they're constantly being reminded by the shepherd who feeds them who they are, who they are, who they are. What happens when sheep are just being sheep is that naked people get covered, hungry people get fed, thirsty people get drinks, strangers get brought near, sick people get healed, prisoners have the bounds of law and sin and death drop off them and they are set free by grace and truth. sheep in whom the life of Christ lives just do what Jesus did. What's wonderful about this, there isn't any should in here, there isn't any ought. You ought to. You know, that kind of message works on goats, ironically. You know, you ought to go clothe more people. You know, goats would go, okay. And in fact, if I landed that way, and that's the way we exegeted this passage, You ought to and you should, that stuff. What I would be able to do and what would be released in our church is we would get all the goats to try acting more and more like sheep. And the problem is, I don't care how many hospitals you visit, I don't care how much money you give to charity, I don't care how much philanthropy you get involved in, I don't care how many hungry people you feed, all of that activity can't change a goat into a sheep. Somewhere along the line, you've got to get stopped right up against all that performance and recognize the primary basis for separation is identity. If you're a goat, you need to get transformed into a sheep, and that's going to take a miracle of God. That's something you can't do. It comes to broken, mourning, hungry people. Marvel not when I say to you, you must be born again. You're going to have to have a change of identity. And when you get a change of identity, Ezekiel 36, 26 says this, I'm going to put a new spirit in you, and I'm not going to give you just a list of behaviors to follow. I'm going to put a new heart in you, and I will put my spirit in you and I will cause you to walk in my statutes and you will be careful to observe my ordinances, not because I gave you a list, but because my spirit's in you causing you to do that. That's what the regenerated, redeemed life is. Nine and a half years ago, when I came here to Church of the Open Door as pastor, I came here with, I think, a pretty good understanding of grace and so I came with a message of grace. I also came with a recognition that there was a massive difference between people who had externally conformed to behaviors, externally conformed to the gospel, and people who had been internally transformed by it. There was a tremendous difference between those two people. The reason I knew that, first of all, was personally. Being a pastor's kid growing up in the church, I knew the doctrine. I could spout off every... I would fight for right doctrine, get into an argument with a Catholic or a Lutheran or somebody else. whoever, a charismatic anybody. I knew the doctrine. I didn't have the oil. I was externally conformed to all the behavior lists, but I was not internally transformed. And when I was internally transformed, the lights went on and I could tell the difference. And it was everywhere I looked, in the church. On top of that, awareness. There was an awareness in me that the message most people had heard in the church, even the evangelical church, rarely got them to look inside and ask identity questions and heart questions. Most of the time, the messages we heard got us to just crank out more behavior that made us look good and simply mask the fact that we were all goats. So we began to bring a message here, and people began to join who understood the message and began to say it loud and began to say it as clear as we could. to look inside to talk about identity being is more important than doing no more shoulds no more oughts let's take all the external stuff off and start looking at the heart when that happened two things at least two things that i recall landed on our church one was fear people got really afraid oh if you do that people will run amok people will go crazy you'll tell people what to do and how to. The other response quite often was anger. What about holiness? You tell people to not polish the outside of the cup and look inside. I'll tell you about it. I care about holiness, real holiness, born of the spirit holiness, not this performance stuff that the Pharisees were so very good at polishing the outside of the cup and of the bowl when the inside was full of venom and hypocrisy and death. Let's look inside the cup, get that clean. New birth, from that comes life. I remember very vividly a mother early on in our time here at Open Door came up to me and said, you know, my son, ever since you came to this church, my son has been listening to your message of take off the external stuff and look inside and he has just been running amok. before he grew up in Sunday school and he went to all the things and he was just a well-behaved young man and now he's just bouncing off the walls. He is just running amok. And I want you, Dave, to meet with my son and get him to stand up for what he believes. And I looked at her and I said, you need to understand something. He is. He is standing up for what he believes. He doesn't believe. And you have put all sorts of external pressure on him and gotten him to perform. And all we've ever been able to do with him thus far is get this goat who is a goat to act like a sheep and you feel better but he's a goat what i will do is get on my knees with you and pray that the spirit of god move on him make him aware that he is not a sheep he is a goat all the behavior in the world won't change that what he needs is a new identity when he gets a new identity you know what's going to happen out of him will flow rivers of living water and you won't have to scream at him because it's about a new identity and from a new identity comes a new behavior and when you don't see the new behavior you need to come back this way, but you don't change the identity by changing the behavior. You change the behavior by changing the identity. The judgment is secured in verse 41 to 46. Then he will say to those on his left, depart from me, accursed ones, into eternal fire, which has been prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry, you gave me nothing to eat. I came to your church thirsty, I got nothing to drink. I was a stranger. You didn't invite me in. I was naked. I came to the temple. You pointed at me and said, there's exhibit A of what we don't want to be like. And they themselves said, Lord, when did we see you? Oh, my goodness. If we would have seen you, we would have surely fed you and done all these wonderful things. In fact, we did. We did those wonderful things. These same people are the people of Matthew 7. Matthew 7, same people who will rise up and say, Jesus, we did all this. In fact, more than that, more than just clothing naked people, we prophesied and we cast out demons in your name and we performed miracles, great feats in Matthew 7 and in Matthew 25. Jesus says the same thing to both those people. You guys don't get it. I don't know you. It's not a performance question. It's an identity question. It's not a performance issue. It's an identity issue. And you know the way I spot redeemed, recreated sheep, the wheat? It's not with the big stuff, like prophecy and miracles. It's with little stuff, like love and mercy and justice. Like doing what I did because I'm in you. The naked get clothed, the hungry get fed, the thirsty have their thirst quenched. Strangers are welcomed in, the sick get healed, and the prisoner has the shackles fall off. How do we respond to all this? I suppose it depends on who we are. if you're a goat there's a couple ways you could respond the first would be the way I've been telling you you can't respond this whole sermon you shouldn't respond and that is this you could hear these behaviors about visiting the sick and people in prison and you could decide oh I'm going to do that and all you would be doing is trying to act like a sheep and you could go and you could probably crank out the behaviors that is altogether the wrong response and it's the kind of response that could do more to seal your doom than to set you free. If you're a goat this morning, the thing you need to hear maybe for the first time is that this whole separation is not based on performance. It's based, first of all, on identity. And the only way for a goat to be turned into a sheep is by a miracle of God that comes to broken, hungry, mourning people who realize that the only way I could attain the righteousness I need is if God would give it to me. The only way I could enter into his kingdom is if God would recreate me, turn me from a goat to a sheep. but I do not have the power to become a sheep. I could act like one, but I can't become one. I need a new identity. Would you do that? My only hope is you. That's called salvation. If you're a sheep, how do you respond to this? Here's how you respond to this. Here's my word to you, sheep. Just be sheep. Just be sheep. And I'm in this church. I'm one of the shepherds here, and I'm going to do everything I can to feed you, sheep. And I'm going to clothe you as best I know how and we're going To clothe each other and we're going To feed each other and we're going To be led and we're going To follow and we're going To wander and we're going To be pulling back. But just be sheep. And some of you have been beaten up because you come out of something like the temple, maybe, and you don' t know that you're a sheep and we're going To have to talk to you a little bit about identity and get some healing for you so that when you're just being a sheep you're going to find out that's really okay to just be a sheep. And as our sheep begin to be more and more healed and our sheep begin to be more and more aware of who they are in Jesus. You know what I think? More and more, even more than we experience now, more and more, naked people are going to get clothed, hungry people are going to get fed, thirsty people are going to get quenched, sick people are going to get healed, people in prison are going to be having the shackles of sin and death fall off of them, and strangers will be welcomed in. Maybe you're asking another question. You're saying something like this, I think I'm a sheep. I prayed a prayer 20 years ago or 10 years, whatever. But, you know, I really don't have a heart for God. I mean, I'm probably just a wandering sheep. I went to Sunday school. I'm a wandering sheep. Or am I a goat? Well, here's my answer to you. I don't know. I don't know. You know, Paul in 1 Corinthians was dealing with a bunch of believers, and in 1 Corinthians 3, he dealt with them as believers. He spoke to them as believers. He said, I think you're redeemed, but you're fleshly. You're babies. You need to understand your identity and grow up. You're carnal, he said in 1 Corinthians 3, but he spoke to them as if they were wandering sheep. There was a weird thing, though. You see, at the end of his letter, the second Corinthian letter, he said this. What I need you Corinthians to do is examine yourselves. I can't answer the question if you're a wandering sheep or you're a goat. You need to look inside and examine yourselves to see if you're in the faith. Because Paul was saying of them, I can't tell. When I know that Jesus' recreation is that God has taken his residence in you, and it's not just about people who know the right doctrine, it's people who have been absolutely changed in terms of their identity. Generally what we see with that kind of radical change in identity is a radical change in living. And when I don't see any of that, when I don't see any fruit, when I don't see any life, I sometimes think it's reasonable to assume that maybe it's because there isn't any life. Maybe it's because you're wounded. Maybe it's because you're wandering. But you need to look inside and ask the identity question. Let's pray as we close. Jesus, in my mind's eye, I truthfully do look across our people here and just see a sea of white. I thank you for the sheep that you have brought to this place, many of them wounded, many of them wandering. God, and we're just falling in love with you over and over again all the time. And we love you as our chief shepherd. And we want to learn more and more to hear your voice. And some of the sheep here today need to be restored and just be encouraged. And I pray you do that, even through this word. But God, it would be irresponsible of me and it would be naive of me to assume that everybody in this room is a sheep. The kingdom is like a flock of people with sheep and goats. And I pray for those among us who might be a goat. They're at the assembly. They're dressed and ready to go. They might have even learned some behaviors of sheep to kind of fit in, but deep within them, they've never experienced the life of God. They've never been recreated by a work of your spirit. And I pray in Jesus' name that you would come with that. That you would gently and yet overwhelmingly identify to them who they are. If they're sheep, I pray that God, you would affirm to all of our sheep that that's exactly what they are, but to those who may be needing a transformation, that you would give them the courage to come and say, I need to be changed. I'm tired of trying to crank all this out myself. I need a new heart. I need a new identity. Do that work among us in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
