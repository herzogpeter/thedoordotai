Matthew chapter 8, our continuing study, picks up in verse 16. We left off in verse 15 last time. If you've been with us at all these last weeks, you're aware that we are in a section called the miracles of Jesus, or the healing ministry of Christ. What has happened thus far is that Jesus has in Matthew chapter 8 healed someone who was afflicted with leprosy. He has healed someone who was afflicted with paralysis, and He has healed someone who was afflicted with fever. And the drama just continues to unfold. As we began this whole series, I told you that there would be three miracles and then a response, and three miracles and then a response, and we've had the first three miracles, and now we're kind of into a response time, when Jesus is going to begin to put His finger on some things and call us to some things. Let's read the text in verse 16. And when evening had come, the end of the day, they brought to Him many who were diseased, who were demon-possessed, and he cast out the spirits with the word, and he healed all who were ill. So I want you to get the picture here. Again, I've been telling you all through this, that many miracles were being done by Jesus, and Matthew picked nine to focus on. Why? Not because they were the only miracles being done, but because they had a message in each one of them. And when the evening came, that's indicating that Sabbath was over now, and these Jews who were very careful to do everything just right and not violate the Sabbath, who might have been a little bit afraid of approaching Jesus, even though he was doing some exciting things. No holes barred anymore. They were coming with everything they had. We want you to heal. And he cast out people with demons, and he healed everybody who was sick. And then verse 17 gives us a real insight. The reason he did that was in order that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, saying this. And this was what Isaiah said. He himself took our affirmatives and carried our diseases away. What that means is the one that Isaiah spoke of as being Messiah, who would carry our diseases away, This is the guy right here. And then when Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to depart to the other side. And a certain scribe came to him and said, Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go. But Jesus said this, That's great. I want you to come. But just know this, that foxes have holes and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head. And that guy disappears into white space between verse 20 and 21. But I will follow you anywhere. and then another disciple came to him and saying basically the same thing I will follow you anywhere too but wait permit me first to go and bury my father but Jesus said to him something that seems really mean and insensitive follow me and allow the dead to bury their own dead I think that God has a word for us and I'd like to pray as we begin that we'd have ears to hear what it is let's pray in the name of Jesus I pray for strength that is not my own in the name of Jesus I pray for power and anointing and authority that is not my own and I pray in Jesus name that we would hear the very voice of God today as individuals and father as a church I really do believe God that you have a word for us as a church it's one of those things that is direction giving and it's a call to us and I pray that you would give us ears to hear and I pray it in the precious name of Jesus Amen I'm going to break the text into two parts the first part is going to be verse 16 and 17 which basically is a glimpse of kingdom truth that is going to set up the second part of the text which is in verse 18 to 22 a call to kingdom commitment there is some teaching I need to do in verse 16 and 17 that is going to set up the call to kingdom commitment in verse 18 and 19 the key to this thing in verse 16 and 17 the glimpse of kingdom truth that I want us to get is really brought to the fore with this prophet Isaiah saying this. He himself took our infirmities and carried our diseases away. And the reason Jesus is doing the miracles is to affirm that Jesus is the one that Isaiah spoke of. Now, whether you know it or not, that passage of Scripture raises a whole lot of controversial issues among believers. One of the questions that goes on among believers, theologically, whether you know it or not, is this. Is healing guaranteed in the atonement? Have you ever heard that debate? Is healing in the atonement or is it not in the atonement? And they go back and forth and on and on. Let me do some teaching. First of all, by bringing you back to Isaiah 53, verse 4, where this is taken from. In the book of Isaiah, there is a prophetic word there about the death of the Messiah and the purpose of his death to bring redemption to men. In that particular account, the wording is different than it is here. That account reads this way. He bore our grief on the cross, and he carried our sorrows on the cross. Yet, when we saw him on the cross, we esteemed him stricken, smitten of God. What that means is this. When the Jews looked at Jesus, this one who claimed to be Messiah and claimed to be God and did all these miracles, when they saw him nailed to a cross, they said, Aha! That proves that God is not on his side. He is smitten of God. God is judging him right now. That's what we thought. But the problem was this, Isaiah goes on, the truth was this, that he was on that cross and he was pierced for our transgressions. That's why he was there. He was not being judged by God. He was being pierced because of our transgressions. And he was being crushed for our iniquities. And by his stripes and his pain, we have been healed. And the healing that is being spoken of in Isaiah is not just physical healing. The healing spoken of in Isaiah very clearly is redemptive healing. You have been healed from your sin condition. Your iniquity and your transgressions have been nailed to the cross, taken away from ever. Hallelujah! And in 1 Peter, when Peter uses this very same passage of Scripture, he is using it very clearly to speak of a redemptive healing, not a physical healing. So it ought to be real clear, this doesn't guarantee healing is not in the atonement, you know, and it's just redemptive healing. And that is all very well and good, except for one problem. Matthew muddies the water up terribly when he does correlate this Isaiah 53 passage with physical healing. So what we're going to do is just skip this. I think Matthew made a mistake. He didn't know what he was talking about, and he didn't go to my school. So if he'd have gone to my school, he would have known that healing is not in the atonement. Okay. I need to do some teaching. You've got to sit in theology class here just for a minute. Let me bring you way back to the beginning when sin entered into the human condition. And you need to know something about sin. When sin entered into the human condition and violated the relationship we have between ourselves and God and between people as well. between men and women. Sin dragged with it some things that were just part of what sin is. When sin came, Romans says, what else came? Death. Sin came and death came with it. Not only did sin drag death with it, but sin brought sickness with it as well. When Jesus looked at the tomb of Lazarus, it said he did two things. First of all, he groaned in his spirit. He was grieved in his spirit. And then it says he wept. Why did he do that? Because he loved Lazarus and he was dead and he was sad he was dying. Well, there was more to it than that because for one thing, Jesus knew that in a moment he was going to say, Lazarus, get out of there. That is the way he said it, by the way, in Hebrew, I know. He didn't say, come forward. He said, get out of there. Okay. One of the things that caused Jesus to groan was that when he looked at sickness and when he looked at death, he saw more than what we see. He saw more than sickness and he saw more than death. He saw the fingerprints of sin. This is what sin dragged with it into the human condition when men were isolated from God. And this is why I have come. I have come to give life, and I have come to bring health and healing to the bones, and I have come to bring eternal life, salvation, by healing the sin condition. At the cross, Jesus dealt once and for all with sin, and he dealt death the final blow. He defeated death. The fact is this. If you deal with sin, you will deal also with the result of sin. You will deal with death, and you will deal with sickness as well. And so, the question remains, is healing in the atonement? Is it part of what Jesus did at the cross? My answer to that is yes, but I need to qualify that. Again, hang with me here. This is going to set up the whole sermon, so hang with. If I say that healing is in the atonement, some questions are raised in my mind anyway, and that is this. If I use terminology like that, when Jesus died, he dealt with sin, he also dealt with sickness. How do I explain sickness then? I mean, if it's really dealt with in the atonement, and if it comes in the atonement, how come Christians get sick, or can they get sick? And I open a real can of worms then, because it seems like I'm saying if it's in the atonement, then Christians won't get sick, or they can't get sick, or if you do get sick, maybe you're not saved, or if you do get sick, maybe you're really not committed to the Lord. Whoa! And some people do teach that, by the way. Let me explain it this way. In the kingdom of God, and here's where I get close to what I really want to teach you here. In the kingdom of God, when Jesus came and brought his kingdom to this earth, he planted a flag in Satan's turf and he says the kingdom has come. But the fullness of that kingdom's power is not going to be known by us until the culmination of history when Jesus comes and grabs his bride and sets up his kingdom in its entirety and sets Satan under his feet completely, and death will be no more, sickness will be no more, and sin will be no more. But we live in a real tension time right now as the church of Jesus Christ, a time when the kingdom has come, its power is here, its victory is here, its power over sin and death and sickness is here, but it's not yet fully here. Let me explain it this way. When Jesus died on the cross, Did he once and for all deal with the sin issue? Was it a settled issue? Yes. Do you still struggle with sin? Yes. If you say no, you're a liar and the truth is not in you, says 1 John. 1 John chapter 1. There is an already yet not yet tension in the kingdom of God, and I live in that. And as a believer in Jesus Christ, though because I live in the flesh, I still struggle with sin, I can in this life find victory over sin by the power of the Holy Spirit that lives in me now. kingdom now. In the fullness of the kingdom, there won't be any more sin, no more struggle. At the cross of Jesus Christ, did Jesus defeat death once and for all? He defeated death once and for all. Yes. Do Christians still die? As far as I know. There's an already not yet tension. It's a done deal. The victory is won. The war is over. But the battle isn't. We live in a tension. Did Jesus at the cross deal with sickness and disease? You need to know. If he did indeed deal with sin, what comes with sin is sickness and disease. He dealt with sickness and disease at the cross. Do Christians still get sick? Yes. We live in an already not yet tension. The kingdom has come. And beloved, healing is for today. Redemption is for today. Victory over sin is for today. But there is a battle going on. I believe with all my heart that healing and practical victory over sin is for today. But one day that kingdom is going to come in its fullness. No more sin. No more death. No more disease. No more struggle. But until then, we are in a war. And we are being called to that war in verse 18. Best illustration of the kingdom dynamic is an illustration that's taken out of World War II. Let me give it to you. In World War II, on June 6, 1944, came a day that lives in infamy, and that is D-Day. At D-Day, the Allies won the war. The war was over. For all practical purposes, it was a done deal. Everything was secure. But you know what? It wasn't until 11 months later that V-Day happened, And that was the day they signed the treaty and people stopped shooting. Interesting dynamic. D-Day, the Allies invaded. The war was over for all practical purposes. But do you know what? Even though the end was secure, people kept shooting at each other for 11 more months. And do you know something else? History records that more people died in that 11-month period after D-Day and before V-Day than at any other period in that war. That feels a lot like the kingdom of God to me. At the cross of Jesus Christ, God, through Christ, won a war. And he planted a flag in Satan's turf on this earth and said this, The kingdom of God has come. And when he died and rose again, Satan was defeated. Sin was banished. Death was destroyed. And sickness was healed. And the war is over, but I got news for you. The battle isn't. And we are living in that period of tension between D-Day and V-Day. and the call of Jesus Christ and the church of Jesus Christ is this. I have given you the keys of the kingdom and what I want you to do is storm the gates of hell during this period. The battle is over. I mean, the war is over. The war is over. The victory is secure. You take the gifts of the Spirit and the power of the Holy Spirit and you storm the citadels of Satan. That's what you're about. What a contrast that is to the church as many of us are involved in and the ones that I see in my mind and have grown up in. We have not been called, beloved, to be a church where it's nice and quiet and serene and we have potluck dinners and hold each other's hands and sing kumbaya all day long. Listen, the church is a hospital. We talk about that all the time here. And this is a place where we hang on to each other and we pray for each other. And there's healing here for broken people. But you need to hear the call of God The church of Jesus Christ is a kingdom group of people that has said, I am setting my face toward the war. What a song Wendy sang. We have declared war. That's what we're about. To storm the citadels of Satan and the kingdom authority of God. Church boring? There is only one way that I can possibly imagine a church being boring. And that is if they have decided by an act of their will to not storm the gates of hell and just stay safe. from that let's move into the call to the kingdom and that's heard in verse 18 already not yet tension we've been called to war and I'm going to introduce you to three people this morning who, having heard the call of God to come to war, to come and follow him no matter what the cost, give them three reasons why they're not going to follow him, although they make promises, I will follow you anywhere until they hear what it costs, and then they back off. In fact, let me set it up in verse 18 by getting the picture. Now when Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to depart and go to the other side. He's leaving the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. And what I want you to hear right now is this, that until this time, it has been very easy to follow Jesus. Get the picture here. We've seen him in chapter 4, and he's all been in the same area, pretty much. He's been in the same area. He introduced the kingdom. When he introduced the kingdom, there was a demonstration of power. People were healed, and demons were cast out. Multitudes came from all over the place to see Jesus. Then in chapter 5, remember, he stopped and he said, Wait a minute, I've got to tell you what the kingdom is really all about. Blessed are the broken. Blessed are the mourning. Blessed are the poor in spirit. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness. And then after the Sermon on the Mount, everybody was amazed at the authority he had. And the crowd was getting bigger and bigger and bigger. but he was just standing there as people came to him. What a guy. I like that. I've never heard of preaching like that before. He does tricks. What miracles. I'm going to go to that church. And then in chapter 8, after the sermon, he starts delivering people and healing people, and the crowd's getting bigger and bigger. You've got to see something. As he leaves the shore in verse 18, this is the first time it's not going to be easy to follow Jesus. They could just be walking by before, see him, and just kind of go there and observe it and go, hey, that's kind of neat. I think I'm going to stick around here. But all of a sudden now, Jesus starts moving away. And he's getting in a boat. And he's going to get off the shore. And he's going to leave the security. And now you've got a decision, multitude. The decision is this. You can either stay on the shore where it's safe, or you can keep following him. It's going to get harder. He's moving out. You're going to have to leave the security of that shore. It's time to make a decision. Do I stay or do I go? You've got to know, this text doesn't indicate it. But in the book of Mark, the parallel passage, we find out that some people did leave. They wanted to be with Jesus so bad that when he got in a boat, a flotilla of boats followed with him. They wanted to be by him. I'll go with you anywhere. But some didn't. See, if I'm going to get off the shore now, it's not just about me sitting and watching somebody make a speech and even liking the speech or seeing them do incredible miracles and even going, that is really God, I know it for sure. it's going to be inconvenient to follow him now it's going to mess up your schedule to follow him now it's going to cost you money to follow him now and it might irritate your family and your friends to follow him now because they're not going to know why you're doing what you're doing why are you getting in that boat and getting off to shore stay here where it's safe three people thought Jesus was great I think it's safe to say the three people we're going to meet might have even told you they loved Jesus I got a feeling the three people were going to meet when they by the way they didn't follow him off the shore they stayed on the shore where it was safe but I got a feeling that one day when they heard that Jesus died on the cross they cried and felt bad and I'm not making fun of that, they probably really did they'd be the kind of person today who at a communion service might even cry I really love him, oh boy I'm so sad he had to do that and the first person who talked to Jesus as Jesus was leaving the shore was a scribe, let's meet him Verse 19, a certain scribe came to him and said, Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go. What a testimony. Oh, think about it. If this guy came to our church or your church and stood up in a church and he said, I want you to know that I love Jesus with all my heart and I will follow him wherever he tells me to go. We'd go, sign him up. Not only do I want to sign him up because of his testimony, but look at who this bird is. This is a scribe. I know some things about scribes. Scribes are educated. Scribes are smart. They are reliable. They are respected. They are authorities on Scripture. They are qualified to teach. They are loyal to the system. They could teach Sunday school here. Now listen, pastor, I'm all for lepers, and I know that our church has been called to minister to lepers, and Jesus did some of that himself even. But guys like this, scribes, know the Word. Get involved. They're reliable. These are the guys who are the backbone of the church. Face it. There's a problem with guys like scribes here. I will follow you anywhere unless it's inconvenient. Unless it's uncomfortable. When he said, I'll follow you anywhere, he said, great, come on. But just know this, foxes have holes, birds have nests. Son of man doesn't have a place to lay his head. Think for a moment with me. Again, just make this as realistic for us as we can. A guy like that comes in our church. Not only does he got a good testimony and would he get involved, but you know what? Let's face it. He would validate our ministry. Do you know what I mean? He would validate Jesus. What has Jesus got so far? On one hand, he's got the Pharisees that everybody does really respect and looks at them and goes, boy, if they're mad, I don't know if Jesus can be right because those are the ones who seem to be always right and they're really mad at him and I'm not sure if I can give myself to this Jesus or not. But then, you see, I see him touch a leper and I see the leper cleanse and my heart is moved by that. I go, wow, that's really God. I'm kind of nervous because these religious people don't like them, but at the same time, I see the power of God, so maybe there is something real. And then, glory to God, a scribe comes, and he says, I will follow you anywhere. He must be okay. He must be right. This is like the president of IBM folks coming to church and going, this is the place I'm going to be. This is like a well-known theologian from the seminary down the road coming and going, the word of God is preached here with power and authority. Good. This is like a professional athlete plays through the Vikings, goes to our church. Hey, I tell you, if those guys think it's okay, must be. Jesus, you blew it. Note, he does not say to this guy, I don't believe you. You can't come. He doesn't say that. He just says, I want you to come. I want you to come. I want you to step off the shore, but just know this, when you come. Foxes have holes and birds have nests, and the Son of Man doesn't have a place to lay his head. And if you do come, and if you do get off the shore, it might be that way for you. Where he is attacking him is right in the comfort zone. There is a kingdom truth here that, I mean, I could scream it, and I don't have the energy anymore. I don't believe that if we really follow the king, I don't believe that if we really do the kingdom here, that it's going to be comfortable here. In fact, I think it won't be comfortable here. There are some promises that I know that if I get in that boat that I know for sure will be there. If I leave the shore of comfort and I'm willing to follow Jesus no matter what, and if we are willing to do that, I do know some promises for sure. You know what he promises me? Peace that passes understanding. And you know what? That is a promise that goes to people who have left the shore of comfort because they need peace that passes understanding. They need peace that is there when you shouldn't have peace because everybody's saying, you're nuts. Where are you going? You guys are acting weird. You're not fitting in with the establishment. I'll tell you something else that's going to be promised to you from the kingdom of God and from your king who is Jesus if you get in the boat and leave what is comfort. Not only peace but power. The power of the kingdom. The power of the Holy Spirit is going to be released in you when you leave the shore of comfort. comforts. Not only that, this is the best of all, presence. Presence. You get in the boat, you know who you're getting in the boat with? The God of heaven himself. But I'm telling you what Jesus is saying to this guy. I want you to come, and I want you to follow, and I want you to follow now, and I'll give you peace and power and my presence, but not comfort. And if you need comfort, Stay there. Hear this? Jesus did not to any person on that shore say this, you can't come. He said you all can come. But you know what? He knew they wouldn't all come. And while he never kicked anybody out of the boat, he left a lot of people behind. Connect it with us. A word for us. You need to hear from my mouth. With all my heart, and I'm not saying we're doing this in every way, but my deepest desire as a church and as a person is in every way I hear Jesus say, come, I want to go. And when that means I leave and we leave the shore of what feels comfortable, we as a church are going to continually leave the shore of what feels comfortable. And we will never say to one person, you can't come. We will never kick anybody out of the boat, but we are going to leave many people behind. I know that, and it grieves me. I think it grieved Jesus. Jesus looked at Jerusalem and said, I would that you would come, but they would not. He never kicked anybody out. Lots of people are saying, then and now, I will follow you anywhere until it's not comfortable. We want nice, quiet, serene churches. that make me feel warm and goy and never pull me out of my comfort zone into the kingdom power and reality of God. Don't call that a kingdom church. And don't call your desire a kingdom desire either. If what you desire is comfort, you don't understand the kingdom. And by the way, the words here are so strong, I wouldn't have the guts to say them in a million years unless Jesus was saying them. foxes have holes, birds have nests the son of man does not have a place to lay his head there's another little insight even in that as far as how he was not only is it uncomfortable if you leave the shore but it could be lonely, just write that down if you follow Jesus no matter what the cost, it could be lonely let me give you the picture that Jesus had on one hand, Pharisees were always there right in Jesus' face and they hated him, they always opposed him on the other hand, there was another group that followed Jesus all around, not only the Pharisees who hated him and were opposing him, but the lepers who needed him. And they weren't always fun to be around. And they didn't help the program, and they didn't make things look slick. But they needed him, and they were broken, and God was delivering his power and his healing to them. And now there's a third group I'm being introduced today, this time. They aren't Pharisees who hate Jesus, and they aren't scribes, and they aren't lepers who need Jesus. They're scribes who applaud Jesus. Way to go. What a sermon. What a miracle. You are really something. And they liked Jesus, and they admired Jesus, and they cried when he died. And they followed him everywhere until it became uncomfortable. And that's why, beloved, the ones who continually are found at Jesus' feet are not the Pharisees, and they aren't the scribes who look good and we think are the backbone. They are the lepers and the fishermen and the prostitutes, broken, mourning, hungry my kingdom's there not many mighty not many noble not many wise that's the way it's always been some people don't leave because of comfort some people don't leave because of security what i mean by leave is follow leave the shore verse 21 another disciple said to him a disciple this guy isn't a scribe he's a disciple what i would do with my mind in that is that means simply this. He's not quite as regal as described. He's not quite as big a catch, but he does identify with Jesus. This guy isn't the president of IBM, but he works at IBM. Very much like the president of IBM or whoever, he's got a lot of I will follow you anywhere talk. I will follow you anywhere is what's inferred. But wait, Lord, let me permit me first to go and bury my father. And then Jesus said to him, Jesus, this is my meek and mild Jesus, our Messiah, sensitive, caring, oh, what a guy. Follow me. Forget about him. Allow the dead to bury their own dead. I wonder what kind of trouble I'd be in if I did that to somebody. Yeah, we're going to go this way. We're going to have a retreat this weekend. You want to come? No, my dad died. Forget it. You come there or not. I don't care. But the dead buried her dead. okay come on sounds like something we need some teaching on doesn't it it's a colloquial expression I need to bury my father it's a colloquial expression it's very popular in the Middle East and it's even popular today I uncovered it by doing some reading and finding a guy named Dr. Waldmeier who's a missionary in the Middle East and he got in touch with a Turkish young man who had just been redeemed and he noticed some ministry potential in this guy and he said I'll tell you what you really are you can be used of God, but you need some training in the Christian faith. I want you to come with me to Europe and go to school for a year or two years, and then when you can come back and begin to minister to your people because it's going to work a lot better if you do it than if I do it. And the Turks said, I will follow you anywhere. I will do that, and I promise to do that, but I've got to bury my father first. And Dr. Waldmeier said, oh man, I had no idea your father was dead. How insensitive of me. Let's go take care of that right now and bury him. I'll help you grieve. We'll stay home a month. You take care of your mom, and then we'll go. and he says, you don't understand, my dad's not dead. The expression you see is this. I will follow you anywhere. But if I leave now and my dad's still alive, I won't get my inheritance. So what I'm going to do is stick around, make sure I get my inheritance, and then when I can afford it, I'll follow you anywhere. You're not fit for the kingdom. That's security. I will follow you after I'm secure financially. the message is loud and clear from sincere from a sincere heart a willing heart an eager heart I will follow you as long as it's comfortable as long as it's secure and after I'm financially secure I'll pay any price because I can afford it then let the dead bury the dead what does that mean? not only does it sound mean it sounds nonsensical I mean how do dead people bury dead people? you know I mean they're all dead and they can't do that and so maybe what it means maybe what it means you know is that this is so important the kingdom is so important dead people are dying and they're dropping off and you just let them later we're going to do the kingdom let them drop let the dead bury the dead what that means is this let those who are spiritually dead whose life is here on this earth and this is all they've got let them spend the rest of their life making sure they are secure in this life you follow me I'll take care of your security give us this day our daily bread and bring the kingdom bring the kingdom in Mark the account or Luke chapter 9 I'm going to read it in just a minute when we go to the third guy it says this you let the dead bury the dead as for you you go and preach everywhere you go the kingdom of God has come the kingdom of God has come you do that I'll meet your needs something echoes in my ear with that seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you. You've got a choice. You can seek the kingdom or make sure you've got all the other things. I hear this all the time. I had a guy come to me with tears streaming down his cheeks, recounting that kind of thing. I spent my whole life even saying this. I will serve the Lord with everything I've got after I earn my first million. Never happened. If you're waiting to feel secure before you leave the shore of security, you will never follow him. You are not fit for the kingdom, the work of the kingdom. let them spend their life making sure they're financially secure you follow me I'll take care of the security well I'll tell you what while this is a real challenge for some of you I would like to think that for some of you because I know some of you this passage is an incredible comfort to your heart because I know some of you have left the shore of comfort and you've left the shore of security because Jesus said to go somewhere and you went and with a whole bunch of people going, that's nuts and that's crazy, and with you in your own spirit going, I can't afford this, God said to go and you went. And it could be in all sorts of different areas. One of the ways that I see it in my spirit right now is with certain people here. I think of a guy named Wayne and his wife Mary, Joyce, and I think of a guy named Jim and his wife Jan. I think of another couple who left a job and a secure job, but God told them to go into the ministry. I don't think everybody ought to leave their job, okay, unless God tells you to do it. And I'm not trying to make heroes out of those people. In fact, they would be embarrassed. They're scared and they're frightened, but God said, come. So they went. And when they did, they had to leave two things. Number one, comfort. Number two, security. And of such people is the kingdom of heaven. That's what it's about. You're going to have to trust me now. And I'll take care of your security. Boy, I'll tell you, I don't know if you hear it, but we had the same thing. Remember the Lord's table? I mean, remember the Lord's prayer? Our Father, who art our King, who art in heaven. Here's what we want more than anything in the world. We want your name to be hallowed. We want your kingdom to come, your reign to come to this church and to our lives and our families. And we want your will to be done. And that sounds so big and so grandiose. And God, we say yes to that agenda. And give us this day our daily bread. Remember, when I talked about that, I said that sounds so mundane. Remember, now we're talking about daily bread. Before we were talking about the kingdom and we were talking about hallowing the name of God and daily bread. The principle we gleaned from that then was this. If you can't believe God now for your physical security, you will never do the kingdom stuff because you're going to be constantly making sure you're secure and never get in the boat, ever. That goes for us as a church, too. There are things we are being called to, and you know what? We can't afford them. I mean, I don't even know what it is right now. I don't have anything specific in my mind. I just know it's a kingdom dynamic. We will be called to it, and God will say, you need to go, you need to do, you need to add. We don't have the money. Well, wait until you've got the money then, God will say. But I'm leaving. Get in the boat now. Trust me for the security. Let the dead bury the dead. You follow me. This is a war. I am so sick of playing church. I am so sick of anything that looks like that. There's a song that I thought of when I was writing this that I used to sing a lot when I was a kid in church. It went like this. Will I be carried to the skies in flowery beds of ease while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas. I liked that. It was great. I had no idea. What is a bloody sea? Maybe a bloody sea is when somebody disagrees with me. I really have a hard time. Maybe a bloody sea is when they sing a song I don't like. See, they don't do Sunday school the way I like. What a bloody sea. What a cross to bear. See, I'm being real sarcastic, I know. But those are the kind of things I hear in the church. churches I've ever been in. The things that, oh, what a trial. Oh, what I want to see is people who, because they've left the boat, and because they've left the shore and gotten in the boat, are fighting the enemy and storming the gates of hell and coming against the citadels of Satan, and because of that, their bodies are being buffeted. When Paul talks about, we are perplexed and we are confused. It was because, not because he wasn't getting his way, it was because he was coming right down the throat of Satan, and Satan don't roll over. the second verse is sure I must fight I must fight if I would reign reign increase my courage Lord I'll bear the toil endure the pain supported by thy word I thank God that there are people in my life that I can look at and see that they're warriors I got a call this morning at 6 o'clock from my dad and when I first heard his voice I thought maybe my mom had died or something because he was crying and he sounded scared and when you have somebody who you respect as much as I respect my dad and love as much and have seen as a warrior as much that's a scary thing because in a way whether we like it or not I mean he's a strength for me and he was calling me and he said Dave, I've called your number five times this morning. I've been up since four o'clock in the morning and I've been that way for the last three days. And I am under an attack from Satan right now that I've never experienced in my life. And I didn't know who else to call. Would you pray for me? Jeff Van Vonderen and I had been in that church just a few months ago. I think you knew about that. We did the burnout seminar. And part of what we talked about was spiritual warfare. And when you really begin to do the work of the kingdom, you're going to have things in terms of demonic activity that you've never seen before. And after that seminar, he was calling back and he was excited at the time. You know, we're seeing some things and some people are being delivered and I've never seen this before and this is a Baptist church. Did you know there are demons in Baptist churches? And Alliance churches. And I prayed for him over the phone. And as I was praying, I thought of this sermon. Because he has chosen, just like I think we have chosen, to do a God thing to do no matter what the cost. And he was bloody this morning. And all through the worship, it was so fun to sing those songs and pray for my dad. He's preaching right now. Pray for him. A warrior. A warrior who has left comfort and left security. Now, at 65 years old, it's supposed to get easy. I told him on the phone, I said, your retirement, Dad, your retirement is on the other side, buddy. You keep fighting the war. I was on a retreat this weekend, so I can't hardly talk. Simpson Memorial Church, what a neat group. God's at work in that church. Pray for that church. Another Alliance Church. Love their pastor. Love their people. He was sharing with me some of the same things that we go through. He was sharing with me, he says, you know, Dave, we talk about warfare, and I was bringing some of these same kinds of things, not this sermon, but the same concepts of warfare and doing stuff of the kingdom, not church stuff. He was talking to me the greatest hassles he's got in this church. There aren't people who are calling him like my dad, saying, I'm getting beat up by the enemy, and I need the power of God released on me right now, or I can't go in the pulpit today. That is warrior fight talk. The kind of people we deal with, Pat was saying, was this. Not all of them, by the way, number of people. Oh, pastor, I'm going to have a heart attack. I saw someone serve communion. Who didn't? Wear a tie. I saw a woman serve it even. That didn't get quite as much of a ride. What's the contrast I'm trying to paint? I'm trying to paint a picture that very often in the church, we have this picture. The church is supposed to be this place where everybody's job is to make me comfortable and me real safe. It is not. It's a war. And we come here to get passed up and put back together and hear the promises of God and get out those doors and storm the gates of hell and then you come back bleeding and we fix you up again and you go back out again with the truth of God. If you want a comfortable place, leave. I can't even say that. Jesus wouldn't say that. He wouldn't kick anybody out. We're not going to do that. But he will leave people behind. We might do that. There's a third guy that came to Jesus that day in Luke chapter 9. It's the parallel account, as I told you just a moment ago. The very same thing is happening in verse 61. Just so you get the flow, you'll see in verse 60 exactly the same thing. Allow the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, you go and proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God. And then another guy came to Jesus and said, I will follow you, Lord, but permit me first to go and say goodbye to those at home. Reasonable request, isn't it? And Jesus said to him again, just like he said to the others, I got news for you. Anyone putting his hand to the plow and looking back is not fit for the kingdom of heaven. This guy is mean. He doesn't understand. He's not very sensitive to people's needs. Sounds reasonable to say goodbye. What you need to understand here is this. who are those at home by the way those at home that way it could be his mommy and his daddy you got some purse strings involved here I got to make sure they're okay or they think I'm okay and they like what I'm doing but I think those at home is broader than that it's your it's your circle and sphere of influence it's those at home it's the people you go to for support they are your friends they are your peers it could be your family as well and they're the ones see Jesus I will follow you anywhere. I love you and when you die, I'm going to cry. But what I got to do before I really follow you and get off the shore of security, I got to make sure that my relationships are going to be there because that's what I have to have to follow you. You are not enough. I got to have them. So I'm going to go back and make sure they're okay with me. And then Jesus says this, I got news. Anyone putting his hand to the plow and then looking back is not fit. Here's the picture. To put your hands to the plow is as if you're saying this, Jesus, I will follow you anywhere. Let's go. You're there, I'm going there. But if you put your hand to the plow and start following Jesus into some scary areas and threatening areas and insecure areas and then you start hearing voices from other people, I don't think you should do that. Is that very godly? I don't know if other Christians do that. You're acting kind of radical. And you look back and go, really, you don't like me now? Two things are going to happen. If you listen to other voices, you're either, number one, really desiring to follow Jesus. I will do it. You hear a voice. You'll either, number one, leave the plow, go over here and go, no, what was your complaint? Why didn't you want me to do that? Please like me. Please be okay with what I'm doing. Or you will just keep on plowing and try to please them at the same time. That's a real good trick. You keep plowing. I'm following you, Jesus. Wait a minute. What did you say? Huh? Okay. And you know what happened? I'm not a plow person, okay? I grew up in Chicago. I hardly know what they look like. I think I know this, that if you're going to plow a straight furrow, if you're going to do that, you're going to have to pick a spot in the distance and you keep your eye on that spot. And if you don't, you go like this. Now picture this. I'm coming to you, Jesus. I'm going to do whatever you say. What's that? I guarantee if you look back and try to do this at the same time, you are going to get so off-center in terms of what God wants you to do and has called you to do, you're going to end up in another field. Let me tell you something about this disciple. This disciple is a lot like a lot of people that I know who do indeed hear the voice of God. I know people who hear the voice of God and their hearts respond. They really do. I am not belittling that at all. I will follow you and I mean it. I want to. But the voice of God is not the only voice they listen to. You see, they listen to mommy's voice and daddy's voice and their friend's voice, and they keep trying to do both at the same time. And you know what? They end up in another field. Or else they stop plowing altogether. And what they'll end up being mad at is the voice of God, not this. Illustration from the Old Testament is Nehemiah. Nehemiah was told by God to build the wall of Jerusalem. It had crumbled. God anointed him and called him, Nehemiah, you are called to build a wall. And you just do what I said and don't pay any attention to anybody else. And in any movement or any building that God is building, there are voices that come and say, Nehemiah, get off the wall. Quit building the wall. In Nehemiah's life, the voices were a guy named Sanbelet and Tobiah. And the voices came this way. First of all, when he started building the wall, it didn't look real good. It wasn't real sharp. And so they would come and say, oh, Nehemiah, that is really a cruddy looking wall. I'll tell you what, if a fox fell on top of that wall, a little fox, it would fall apart. Tell you what, come on down. We'll have a little talk. Make sure that we're building this wall right, and then you can get back up there. In order for Nehemiah to go and figure out how to build the wall better, he would have had to have gotten off the wall. And I'm telling you, anybody who takes his hand off the plow after setting his sight isn't fit for the kingdom. You don't listen to those voices. A little while later, something else happens. see at the beginning of the work the complaint was this is a cruddy wall it's a weak wall but all of a sudden God began to give him power and the wall got strong well we're going to have to try a different way I can't come to you and say the wall is weak now the problem is the wall is too strong Nehemiah and you know what this wall is getting so strong it's beginning to intimidate the king what are people going to think it's so big it's so strong the king is going to get the wrong idea. He's going to think you're building an army here and you're going to overthrow him. So he's going to come and overthrow us. Let's get off the wall, go and talk to these people who are grumbling and complaining and getting the wrong idea. Make sure they have the right idea and then go back and build the wall. And I'm telling you, anybody who puts his hand to the plow, hears the voices and turns back, isn't fit for the kingdom. Keep building the wall and you're going to hear voices all the time. If as a church, we are serious about doing the kingdom, we are going to have to leave comfort, we are going to have to leave security, and we are going to have to leave, whether we like it or not, relationships. What does it mean to be not fit for the kingdom? That's a scary thought. The person who hears the voice of God but other voices too is not fit for the kingdom. What does that mean? Well, it may mean he's not in the kingdom. I mean, there's a lot of I will follow you talk, when the rubber meets the road, we're going to stay safe and we're going to be comfortable and we're going to stay secure and that's what I'm going to hang on to. I'm not going to hang on to Jesus. I'm going going to hang on to security. And I'm going to hang on to these relationships and make certain that everybody's okay with me before I ever do anything. Maybe they're nicht in the kingdom. Maybe they are in the kingdom but it simply means you're not fit. You don't fit. You're in the kingdom but you don't fit. I mean, it's like you're an oddity because you keep telling me you're going to follow me but you don' t. You keep telling me I'm the only God, but I'm not, because it's your friends who are your God, and your security, and your comfort, that's your God. So you're in the kingdom, and you really do love me, but you don't fit. And I can't tell you which I think it is. It could be both. Either way, it's not good news. This has been a hard word today. I'd like to think that you can tell it's been a straight word. Up to this point in our study in the book of Matthew, we have really been especially in the miracle part we've really been dealing with two groups of people two kinds of people we've met Pharisees who were hating the movement of God and every time God moved they hated it and what they noticed was a tradition God violated and when God moved if they didn't if they did recognize it was God they hated it the irony of this new person we're being introduced then the second was lepers now this new person is an oddity because he's not a Pharisee Pharisee, in fact, a scribe and these disciples would have probably have not liked Pharisees either. He would have probably come to Jesus and said, oh, Jesus, don't pay attention to those Pharisees. They're phony and they're baloney and they're self-righteous and that's not like us. We're not like that. But these people weren't lepers either. Lepers are a pile of mush who need divine healing right now or they're not going to go another step. These people were respectable, capable, reliable, and knowledgeable with an eager heart, a sincere heart a verbal heart and we're saying this i will follow you anywhere as long as it's comfortable as long as it's secure and as long as everybody still likes me not fit for the kingdom i'm not sure what the ministry of the spirit is to your individual heart it could be that there is a real brokenness in terms of seeing yourself maybe as a scribe who really does love Jesus but all your life you play it safe and you've never experienced ever the power of God because you've never needed the power of God you can always control you stay on the shore same with security and same with relationships I know for a fact that there are people here who because of your seeking God and because of your hungering for that and moving away from comfort and security are this close to losing friends that you care a lot about. And God may need to deal with you and you may need to say some things to Jesus about that. I will follow or I will not. But it could be also that the Spirit of God is ministering to people in ways that aren't connected with anything I say. But I want you to know that my deepest desire for this church, and I think you know this, but again it's echoed, that we be a kingdom church that follows Jesus no matter what the cost. Comfort, security, relationships. Never kick anybody out. But we might leave people behind. I don't want to leave anybody behind. Father, I pray that your spirit would take this and brand it on our hearts and on our minds. This, to me, is one of those words from you that changes us. it deepens us. What a joy. My mind right now, I think all the way back to the beginning of Matthew when we started. And we heard so much grace and so much forgiveness and so much love and all this healing in it and we're drawn to it just like the multitudes. Just like the multitudes, we come and we go, oh, this is water and this is bread. But now, Jesus, you are calling to this church. It's time to leave the shore. It's time to pick up the armor. It's time to go to war. And Jesus, in your name, I say yes. And I think we do too. Whatever it means, we'll leave the comfort and the security and the relationship. You are our source. Make that true in us in this place. And bind Satan and all his lies and all the ways he wants to hang on to us and keep us safe. We just break that in Jesus' name. Amen. you
