*Music* Hey guys, I'm Dallas. I'm Dave. I'm Mac. And I'm Spencer, and we play in a band called Hoosa, called Husa, but mostly we hang out here at Open Door. So we're going to be reading the Advent Scripture this week, and I'm sure you can follow along. Today's reading is from Luke chapter 2, verses 25 through 35. And there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel. And the Holy Spirit was on him, and it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he'd seen the Lord's Christ. And he came in the spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to carry out for him the custom of the law, then he took him into his arms and blessed God, and he said, Now, Lord, you're releasing your bondservant to depart in peace, according to your word. For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you've prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light of revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel. And his father and mother were amazed at the things which were being said about him. And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign to be opposed, and a sword will peace even your own soul. This is the word of the Lord. Well, today's we enter the third week of Advent. I'd like to remind you that last week, for the second week of Advent, Steve Weins extended what he referred to as some invitations that if responded to would not only introduce you to the themes of Advent, which is something we want to do during Advent, but the questions he was asking and the invitations he was making would actually invite you into the work of Advent, which according to the text that he chose last week, Luke 3, 1-6, was to do the work of preparing ourselves, of preparing our souls for the coming of the King. Prepare the way of the Lord, Luke 3, verse 4. Quoting the prophet Isaiah, it says, Make ready the paths, as it were, that lead to your heart so that God might have easy access to your heart. Here's how you do that, according to the text, by making straight what's crooked, which is hard work, by filling in what's low, by making smooth what's rough, which is the work of Advent. It was just an invitation that Steve extended to which you could say yes or no, but some of you last week, I'm pretty sure, said yes. I will do that work. I will accept this invitation to give God access to my heart. And you began to enter in, to answer the questions that Steve asked of us last week, to respond to the invitations revealed in the text. And most of the time when we do that kind of thing, at least in the moment of saying yes to those things, it feels good. Because your heart is open and tender and eager to obey, so your heart says yes. You didn't get pounded into it or even talked into it. Your heart said yes, and it feels good to say yes like a lot of you did last week. But it kind of raises for me some questions. And they're kind of nosy questions, actually. Maybe even none of your business questions. Among the questions are these. To those of you who actually did say yes and enter in, the questions are these. So, how'd it go? How did you feel? Maybe the biggest is this. What did it cost you this week? Because last week you said, yes, I'll go there. I'll enter that. I'll accept that invitation. Because last week, you guys, as I was sitting right over there listening to Steve, among the things I thought when he was talking were these things, that any time, any time, you say yes to God, be it in the context of Advent or some other season of your life, in the moment of saying yes, it almost always feels good because your heart is open and tender and eager to obey so your heart says yes. It feels good to say yes. But there's this cost to saying yes. Almost every time there's this cost to saying yes that we maybe didn't know about when we first said yes. And it applies to a lot of things, not just saying yes to God, but I mean every area of life. When you got married, did you know what that would mean when you said, yes, I do. It feels so good on that day to say yes. But did you know what that yes would cost, where that yes would bring you? Which is why today on this, the third week of Advent, I want to talk about the cost of saying yes. But in particular, I want to talk about the cost of saying yes, the way that Mary said yes when she said yes to God And the way she said yes to God is kind of that famous line we've heard and hear it often at this time of year when the angel came to Mary with this promise of life being born in her. Her response was, yes, be it done unto me just as you said. It feels good to say yes. When your heart is open and tender and in moments like that there's often a tear in your eye and you're eager to obey, but Mary, did you know what it would cost when you said yes to that angel's invitation to receive the life of God in you, allowing it to grow in you and then stretch you, sometimes even scare you? Did you know? My real question of Mary would be this if I could get her here. If you knew then, on that day that you said yes to God at the very beginning as a young teenage girl, if you knew then what you know now about what all that cost you, would you still say yes? Because the fact is this. She had no idea what she was saying yes to when she said yes. She had no idea what this would all mean, where this would all lead, what this might cost any more than you or I do or did when we have ever said yes to God. Particularly the first time you said yes to God. Do you remember the first time? I mean, maybe that's a goofy question. How would you remember something like that? Some of you remember very vividly the first time you ever said yes to God because you were a little kid. I was eight. I do remember it vividly. Kneeling at my parents' bed, eight years old, come into my heart, Lord Jesus. There is room in here for you. I receive your life. I will follow your way. I was eight. and it feels really good to say yes I remember that day it felt really good when your heart is open and it's eight years old tender and eager to obey and eager to follow but I had no idea what this all meant where this might lead what this could cost so Mary did you know that your yes to God would begin for you a journey that would one day bring you to the foot of a cross, actually, where you would actually watch the promise of this life die. I wonder what she thought that day, what she felt that day, and I wonder if she remembered on that day what the angel had said on another day, Luke 1, 32, that he will be great. The son of the most high God, a ruler of the nations, a kingdom without end, will he have, but at the foot of the cross as he's dying before her, some kingdom, this. And yes, the resurrection is coming. And when it does, every doubt will be vanquished, every fear will be gone, every promise will be fulfilled. But Mary, did you know that when you said yes to God, there would be days like this, when the lights go out, when the dreams are dashed, when the promises of God don't seem to be true. So did you know what it would cost? And was it more than you expected? Well, again, like you and me, I think, she kind of knew. I mean, you know, when people say yes to God, they kind of know. You kind of know. Well, this could have some ramifications. It's why Sometimes it's hard to say yes because this might bring me someplace. She kind of knew that it would cost. She kind of heard some things in cryptic ways anyway. There was this thing about a sword from this Simeon guy, which brings us back to the text that the guys read for the Advent reading this morning about Simeon, who'd been looking for the consolation of Israel all his life. He'd been promised by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. Luke 2, 27. Let's read it again. And he came in the Spirit into the temple one day. And the parents brought in the child Jesus to carry out for him the custom of the law that he that is Simeon took Jesus into his arms and blessed God, saying, Now, Lord, I can die. Thou hast let thy bondservant depart in peace according to your word, Therefore my eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light of revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel. And Mary and Joseph, verse 33, were amazed at these things that were being said about him, this little child, this baby of theirs. But then Simeon turns his attention from the baby that he was holding and giving God glory to the parents in verse 34. and after he blesses them, he turns his attention specifically to Mary. You see it in the text with these words. Behold this child. You need to know, in addition to this child being the consolation of Israel, verse 25, and the light of revelation to the Gentiles, verse 32, he will also be the cause for the fall and the rise of many, a sign to be opposed. Indeed, because of him, a sword will pierce your own soul as well, which makes it sound like the cost of all this just went up. And it did go up. And actually, in some very tangible and real-life ways, and I'd like to visit quickly four of them this morning, Four events, four vignettes in the life of Mary that I believe speak to the piercing of this sword and the cost of Mary's, yes, and many of these piercings are piercings that we've experienced in a variety of ways. We'll be able to identify with some of these more than you might think. First came actually to Mary not long after Simeon's prophecy. When an angel appeared in Matthew 2.13 to warn them, you guys don't go back to Bethlehem, go south toward Egypt. Here's why Herod has gone crazy. Herod was a king, power hungry and paranoid. When he heard the word about a king being born to the Jews, he considered this king a threat to his kingdom. His solution was to slaughter all the baby boys anywhere near Bethlehem under two years old. And according to Matthew 2.18, the weeping and anguish in Bethlehem because of that was beyond consolation. Which is something that even because of the events we're living in right now, we can feel that kind of thing. The weight of that kind of thing. So be with Mary now, who was warned by an angel, to not go back to Bethlehem because it's dangerous there. So at one level, she's grateful that she escaped, but horrified that others didn't, alone with her thoughts. We don't know what she thought, but I would think she would begin to wonder and remember the words of the angel, the prophecy of Simeon, so full of hope and promise. The angel said, blessed are you, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. And Simeon said this child would be the consolation of Israel. Consolation is that this child will be a source of comfort for all of Israel. Instead, because of him, there are mothers in Israel beyond comfort, beyond consolation. And a sword begins to pierce her soul. And it's a sword of, among other things, I think, confusion. and it's a sort I think most of us at one time or another have or will feel or have felt see here's the dilemma we have when life kind of happens if I actually do hold in my hands in metaphor the answer, Jesus if I kind of hold in my hands and in my heart the solution if that's true Then why am I so confused And why do I sometimes feel so helpless To change anything I thought, I didn't say this out loud But I kind of thought somewhere in my spirit That when I said yes to God My questions would be answered My problems would be solved The pain would be avoided And what about the hate? I mean, I just don't get the hate. Somebody explain that to me. Well, okay, Herod's crazy. Here's your explanation. He's crazy. But Mary, did you know that when you said yes to God, be it done unto me, and when you did, remember how good that felt? Because your heart was open and tender. There was a tear in your eye. It felt so good to say yes. But did you know when you said yes, that some people around you would resent it that you said yes? Would be threatened by your yes, would actually try to kill your yes? Well, she didn't know that any more than some of you in this room right now knew, that when the life of God came to you and began to grow in you, and began to express itself through you, that some people around you, Even family and friends would resent it, be threatened by it, even try to kill it. Not kill you, but there's life in you. Ridicule it, make fun of it, try to kill it. And suddenly your yes to God costs more than you expected. Years ago I had a pastor friend. By all accounts successful. His church was growing. He was a good guy. But God began to birth in him a new thing. And we were kind of friends at the time. I knew him relative to what was going on in his life. and we talked back and forth, and some of the changes that he was going through, I was going through at the same time, because God was calling him to deeper understandings of God's grace, things he'd never known about the grace of God. He was a Southern Baptist guy his whole life, and things about God's kingdom that were bigger and more expansive than he'd ever known before, and things about God's power, particularly the power and reality of the Holy Spirit alive and the gifts that the Spirit can give. And he was coming alive to these things, these things he'd never seen before, known before, much bigger story now when he was delighted to bring them to his church and teach them to his people and invite them on this journey and some people arose and came to life as well but others didn't because some didn't want what he had, didn't like what he had and tried to kill what he had and I remember in conversations him being confused by that at first now we understand these things but it's like can't they see that this is God like Mary's walking can't they see this is God can't they see this is good they couldn't see that it was God in him it was good in him they couldn't tell they took a vote he lost his church I laugh like that it wasn't but the cost of saying yes went up that day It's so funny about saying yes to God In the moment it feels good Your heart is open and tender And eager to obey With a tear in your eye You don't care what it costs You don't know what it costs Second event, 12 years later Luke chapter 2 verse 41 Joseph and Mary had taken Jesus to Jerusalem For the Passover You know the story, I think you do I'll remind you of it here I think it's a funny story Traveling with a large group of people They go to Passover every year. They bring Jesus this year. They leave the Passover celebration still with a large group of people, so I can maybe understand this. We figure Jesus, our 12-year-old, is with some other member of the family. We're in a large group. Day and a half out of Jerusalem, they find out Jesus isn't here. You thought he was. He's not. He's not with us, terrified like anyone would be. But this is a little worse because they didn't just lose a kid. They lost Jesus. This is bad. day and a half later so it's three days they find him as you know i think in the temple sitting with the teachers of the law who were amazed at his knowledge of the scriptures and his understanding of the father and mary like a mother though relieved to see him isn't happy i love this verse 48 luke 2 48 son what are you thinking that's not actually that's my paraphrase but look at this. Why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously looking for you. I think they clean that up a little bit. To which he says in effect, I mean this is a weird response. If he's a 12-year-old kid, Jesus, I don't get it. Why are you upset? Why is it that you would be looking for me? You want to slap him if he's your kid, but he's Jesus. This is God. Anyway, he says this. Do you not know that I had to be in my father's house? And my father's house isn't your house. It's this house. And some of the translations say that I'm now about to be about my father's business. And I think a sword pierces Mary's heart right there. Why? Because their relationship is changing now. He's exerting his will. He's not asking her opinion or permission. He's not doing her plan. He's changing the schedule. I can't control him anymore as if he's here to serve me. I liked him better when he was away in a manger, when he was a cuddly little baby. but the truth is, I think all of us. I mean, if you stay in your journey with God at all, you are going to experience something like this somewhere along the line. If you're hearing any measure of the truth about what our journey with God is really like, in fact, you'll experience this kind of thing probably several times on your journey with God. The first time for me that I can remember was young adulthood. See, I grew up in church, as most of you know, and I heard the stories over and over. the kind of stories a young person, a little kid, should hear. I heard those kind of stories. That Jesus loves you, Dave. That Jesus is going to take care of you, Dave. That he is here for you, Dave. I love that story. I love it that it's all about you, Dave. But then he began to exert his will in this relationship. because I began to grow up a little bit, because it's not all about you, Dave, and it's not all for you, Dave, because this is about my father's business, Dave, and I am calling you to something bigger than you or your comfort or your security or your sense of well-being, which I know. But when you first hear that stuff It feels like a sword Because the relationship is changing He's exerting his will And the cost of saying yes It felt so good in the moments Because the heart was open and tender and eager to obey The cost goes up Third scene actually illustrates what I just talked about a little more graphically. It's 19 years later. Luke 8, Mark 3, Matthew 12. All mention this. The ministry of Jesus has begun. He's becoming quite popular. Multitudes are following him on this particular occasion in Luke 8. Jesus is teaching to a large group of people. A crowd has gathered. Mary and the brothers of Jesus had come to visit, but they couldn't get in. The crowd was too big, and they couldn't get to him. And Luke 8, 20, says this. Look at it up on the screen. It was reported to Jesus. Jesus, by the way, kind of whispering to him in the middle of his talk, I suppose. I don't know. Your mother and your brothers are standing outside. They just want to see you. It's kind of, hey, Jesus. But Jesus answered and said to them, who is my mother? And who are my brothers? But those who hear the word of God and do it. Huh. You know, he could have said a lot of things there. Like he doesn't know me. I don't get this. And see, I think there's a lady on the outskirts of that crowd who feels the thrust of a sword. See, I understand these calls to obedience, Jesus. I'm getting all that, but I'm actually beginning to wonder if he cares about me personally at all anymore. Because our whole relationship used to be about how much he loved me, how special I was to him, how everything he did, he did for me, just for me. How many of you have heard that, you know, if you were the only person on the earth, Jesus would have died for you, just for you. Well, here's the deal, Mary, and all the Marys of the world know this, Mary, he does love you. And he loves you special. just like he loves you and you and you and you and he loves you special. But know also this, Mary, that there is a level of discipleship and obedience that he calls all of his followers to, including you, Mary, and it may sound harsh, but it's almost as if he's saying this. There is no special deal. There is no cost reduction, no discipleship discount just because you're related or simply because you're the pastor or you're not the pastor or you give a lot of money or you grew up in church. Who is my mother? And who are my brothers and sisters? Those who hear the word of God and say yes and then say yes and yes and yes. All that reminds me of a story, another story in the Gospels, Matthew 8, 18, when Jesus saw the crowd of people, big crowd of people, Again, his popularity was really high right now. Multitudes were following him, and he gave orders, even while the crowd was still kind of pushing in on him, to go to leave the shore and get into a boat and go to the other side. And the picture here is really significant. It's very symbolic because until now, and this is at least part of the meaning of this picture, it's been relatively easy to follow Christ, to consider yourself a follower of Christ, because in this scene, everyone was following him. everyone was a follower all you had to do is be in this big crowd of people we're kind of following him but now if you're going to follow him now jesus seems to be saying it's going to cost you a little bit more because now you're going to have to leave the security of the shore and the crowd and get in the boat and go to the other side now and immediately verse 19 it says in matthew 8 there was a certain scribe who said to him teacher i will follow you wherever you go. Wouldn't you love to hear that? This is a disciple for sure. To which Jesus says, in effect, my paraphrase, great. I love that. But just know this, that foxes have holes and birds have nests and the Son of Man does not have a place to lay his head. And if you follow me, it might be that way for you. Still want to come? Well, the truth is this. We don't actually know what happens to him because nothing is mentioned of him again, whether he went or whether he didn't. I think he disappeared in the white space between verse 20 and 21. Lots of people do. Hang around. But followers of the teacher, followers of Jesus, I don't know. Time will tell. Are you saying they're not saved? It's not about being saved. Are you a follower? Are you a Father, are you saying yes, and then yes, and then yes, and then yes? In fact, it is in the same scene. Many did get in the boat. And it wasn't just the disciples. In fact, Mark 4 indicates that there were many boats. So people hearing that they were all going to get in the boat and leave the shore, a bunch of people went and grabbed boats. And so we're following him. We're going after him. And I'm sure that as they were in the boat, There was a flotilla of boats going across this body of water, and I think they're feeling like we're the real followers. We are willing to pay the price. We don't care the cost. When halfway across the lake, a great storm arose, and it was so great that they thought they were going to die. And if you remember the story, Jesus was asleep in the boat, so it looks like not only are we going to die, but Jesus doesn't care. And that's, again, messing with my mind. This is all very confusing because we kind of had this idea that if we said yes to God, things would go well. The storm would be calmed. Which means that the cost of saying yes to God just went up again. But it didn't stop there because this pattern, it just continues. It's part of the deal. Because later in this same gospel, Jesus comes to his disciples again on the water and says, this time, remember last time I told you to get in the boat? This time, I want you to get out of the boat. He's talking to Peter, which kind of makes you wonder, okay, what do you want? Jesus, get in the boat, get out of the boat. Well, here's the answer, real clear, real quick. Here's what he wants, like everything, like absolutely everything. And if you really hear that, a sword will pierce your soul. You are not your own. You've been bought with a price. And the cost of saying yes, that in the moment feels real good, because your heart is open and tender and eager to obey, just goes up again. Final scene. Mary at the cross again. I think all of us have at one time or another imagined ourselves sitting or standing at the feet of the cross. And when you're there, I especially kind of do that. I'm sure you do too on Good Friday when the service is all about that. And it's a really important discipline to kind of allow yourself to feel the grief of that, the horror and the grief. But actually, I think when we do that, there's a sense of gratitude as well because we see him suffering as our Savior. And so we're grateful that he was willing, but Mary was a mother. We've got to think of Mary the way Steve always talks about it, who's an actual person in the actual world, having actual feelings. She was an actual mother, saw him as a son. That's my boy. And she had watched as they mocked him and spat on him, beat and abandoned him, publicly exposed and disregarded him, then executed him. So, Mary, did you know? When you were going through this, did you know that in three days, all of this would turn to life, the resurrection? Well, certainly, we know she heard all that. Jesus had spoken of that. Do you think she believed all that? Well, he's going to rise. It's okay. Let's assume she did believe all that. But even if she did, the undeniable fact before her right now is this, that all her hopes and dreams, her expectations are being dashed. They are dying right in front of her eyes. An angel told me that he would be a king, a ruler of the nations. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Favored are you, blessed are you, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus, and a sword pierces her heart as the cost of her yes just goes up a little bit more because now she is being called to love and believe God even when the lights go out, when the dreams are dashed and the hopes are shattered, but even then she stays. I love that about her. Think about that. When Peter made his I will not deny you speech, but did, deny him. Mary made no such speech, but didn't deny him. And when all the disciples agreed with Peter that they would never flee, but did flee, Mary made no such promise, but didn't flee. So there she was, where she wanted to be, where she had to be, at the foot of the cross with Jesus, G. Campbell Morgan says, One holds the planets in their orbit, even in his death, even when her dreams were dashed. Even then, be it done unto me, just as you said. Even if it means that a sword will pierce my soul, I say yes. And yes. yes. But now imagine with me what must have exploded in her heart the day the stone was rolled away. No words of I that could come close to describing that, but this is for certain. It was joy inexpressible and full of glory because right in the middle of these journeys with God that at times feel like death, there is life. And it's eternal kind of life right here and right now, and it's the kind of life that can be yours, all I have to do is say yes. And in the moment, that yes feels good, especially if in the moment the heart is open and tender and eager to obey, so we say yes and yes and yes. But there's a cost to that yes. But the cost of that, yes, will actually yield things while on one level might feel like death will yield more and more and more life. And so we say, yes. Be done unto us, just as you said. Would you stand with me as we close? Lord I have two things on my mind just came into my mind last night it came it's coming now Lord I feel grateful for the fact that as these people stand I'm around so many people who have in their heart a yes to you there are so many people on this journey who have said yes more than once who have paid prices for their yes I pray in Jesus' name, your spirit come right now and bless them wherever they are in their journey. The prices they're paying for having said yes to you, Holy Spirit, come. Minister your grace and your life and your peace and your power and the courage by your spirit to continue to be a people who are saying yes and yes and yes and yes. Come into our hearts, Lord Jesus, again today. Help us make room in there for you every day. And all God's people said, amen, yes. you
