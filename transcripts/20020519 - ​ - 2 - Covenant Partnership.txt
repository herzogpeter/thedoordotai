Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray as we go to this time. Father, I thank you for the fact that you have been the God of our journey for years and years. And as these weeks we are in a pointed way considering the things you're speaking to us about our journey and things we need to do. I pray that we would continue to be faithful to the things you say. Help us hear your voice in this word today in Jesus' name. Amen. Next week we are going to get back to what we loosely call around here normal. When we get back to the series that we've been dealing with in the issue of power and the path to power. But today I want to finish something that we began to talk about last week. What I described a bit last week as kind of a family talk. And not exactly with apologies but an explanation to visitors. This is really something directed to people who are part of our body. comes in the context of our need to prepare ourselves for where it is we're going as a church, both physically as it's embodied in our obvious move to Maple Grove, but also as it relates to the spiritual things that God is calling us to and the places we are going. If you were with us last week, you undoubtedly recall that I spoke to an issue that I have not addressed in the context of a sermon in 21 years of ministry here at Open Door. The issue is this, what it means to be a member of Church of the Open Door. More importantly, we talked about how the process of membership here at Open Door is so inseparably connected to the fulfillment of our vision for ministry as a church. Indeed, so central is it. That the term membership is probably not an adequate term to describe what we are trying to do, what we are inviting you to, for what we are in fact trying to do and inviting you to is much better described as a covenantal partnership. Covenantal partnership rooted in and born out of a passionate desire to experience together the process of authentic transformation in the context of a community of faith that we call a church, that we call specifically our church, Church of the Open Door. So when we talk about and invite you into membership, we are not talking about inviting you into what I described last week as a contract, but rather a covenant, a covenant that actually we're going to ask you to revisit and renew every two years. We have a renewal process every two years. In fact, there's going to be one tonight. June 2nd is another one, and that's one that Bonnie and I are going to go to where we renew our membership, and that might strike you a little bit as odd. What, pastor and his wife need to renew their membership? Yeah, and I'll tell you why. There's a number of reasons. One is because as well as being leaders, we're players here. As well as being leaders, we're followers, disciples of Christ here. That's not even the biggest reason. I'll tell you why we're doing the renewal thing. It's primarily because we're not looking for consumer clients. We're not interested at Open Door and nickels and noses. We are looking for partners in ministry. We are looking for covenantal partnership with people. And a covenantal partnership is, as I described it last week, about agreeing together to do all that we can together to create an environment and to provide resources that show us how in practical, living, fleshy ways, how we can receive the life and love and grace of God through Christ, and then to daily walk it out, to daily live in it, grow in it, be formed by it in ways that radically and wonderfully affect our real lives. A covenantal partnership says this, we will together bring our lives before God in a community of faith where disciples are being made till Christ be formed in us. And all of this becomes especially important as we anticipate our move. And among the things that we're anticipating is a significant influx of people who have no idea who we are and what we value. Last week, I laid out as best I could the why of all of this. Today, with a little help from my friends, specifically Keith Meyer, and then in a moment Scott Bernstein. I want to dress this out a little bit more for you in practical ways. Keith, come and take the pulpit. Well, I'm the executive pastor here at Church of the Open Door, and we've had kind of a title that Dave and I agreed on, and I do everything Dave can't do, won't do, or if he did do, we'd be in big do. we do our giftings differently he's the preacher teacher and I am I do some teaching and certainly but I'm around the staff and we both sit on the board but I do some of the more CEO type of roles one of the concerns I've had as working with working with mega churches I've been in grew up in large churches and pastor large churches is the fact that mega church discipleship is almost an oxymoron. The church goes so fast, so big, that the motions of the soul go really slow, and they're about people one at a time. And the megachurch is not the only one wrestling with this, but across the United States, people are wrestling with the fact that the evangelical church knows so much, can worship so much, and is involved in a lot of activity, and God's blessed it so much. But there's more and more and a concern with the kinds of things that Dave talked about last weekend when George Barna does a survey, and it shows that in our lives, our lives are no different, not that much different than those out in the world. And that's not about nominal Christians. That's evangelical Christians, those who claim to be born again and be formed as disciples. So as CEO and the board with me, Doug Lang's going to be, I think, at our open forum, we at Open Door have been real concerned about this. Early in my ministry I got concerned about it when one day I came home, this was oh man, 20 years ago when I was ministering just starting to minister. I was all trained up, ready to go and I'd been teaching I'd been out four nights, you know teaching and ministering and everything and I sat down, exhausted my son who at that time was about 5'6 next to me after about a half an hour of vegetation cartoon watching, he turned to me and he said, Dad, are you home yet? That got me. Now, that might not sound like a big moment, you're just maybe a little preoccupied. No, that was my lifestyle. And I did not see people. I was seeing people all over the place, but I didn't know about a life that was slowed down in God and shaped by God where you really were present to people very deeply the way that Jesus calls us to be his disciples. You see, the Christian life is not a bunch of teachings. it's not a worship service that's a part of it and it isn't even doing a lot of things for God a lot of people said what is God going to ask for there's a lot of parables that talk about God Jesus talks about the Father as a businessman who owns a field or he owns an organization and he comes to ask whether the product is really being produced and you might ask what are the marching orders where are they in scripture Jesus said all authority when he was about to go back to heaven and then descend back again through the Spirit on his people. He said, all authority has been given me in heaven and earth. So go and make disciples of all nations. And lo, I'm with you always. Now, did I leave something out there? I did. That's the Great Commission. But the church is more and more realizing, especially in America with all of our seminaries and all of our Christian music and all of our activities, we are the most resourced people on the whole earth. But people are concerned about the fact that the gospel light's going out because we have forgotten the little phrase, teaching them to do all I have commanded. There's a life. There is a life. There's a way to live that is diametrically opposed as this world is to heaven, that is there for us to live. And we as a church have decided and the board has decided that we want to answer that question someday. When we come before the maker for our own lives and the corporate lives, What did we do? And you know, he isn't going to ask how many people did Dave get to preach to. He isn't going to ask that. He isn't going to ask how big the church was. He isn't going to ask how many activities we had. He's going to ask in the process of ministry, whether you were setting up chairs or preaching the sermons or the executive pastor, did you become, because of the gift of my grace and love, a more loving person with the time you had? And with the time you had, were the people around you invited with all your brokenness, but were they invited to a life of love that they could taste and see? And was it significantly different enough that they didn't even have to have you go through an evangelism program to learn how to get at them? They'd just notice it and say, I want to learn to be that too. Amen? That's what we're talking about when we talk about this whole process of membership. It's not about membership program. It's really about inviting you to a corporate goal we have. The board is responsible for the congregation's trust that this church, with all of its money, its time, its energy, and its direction, is doing what the master asks us to do, right? The Great Commission. And so it's so cool to be at a church where we have really kind of, in postmodern terms, they use this word a lot, deconstructed the church. We really in the past six years have deconstructed the church, kind of tore it all apart. We've talked about the preaching. We've talked about membership classes. We've talked about how you do kids, how you do youth, how you do adults, how you do PC. I could go on and on and talked about the one goal. Everything's got to be around the one goal. What? Becoming loving people and loving others into the kingdom. That's the whole game. That's the game. And so as we've done that, it's interesting. We've just begun to do this in this membership process. We're kind of stumbling into it. We've made some mistakes. But I was at a meeting. I was called to a meeting by a friend of mine who's the pastor of Stuart Briscoe's Church over at Elmbrook in Milwaukee. Mel Rents, he used to be an executive pastor. He graduated. And he is a senior pastor of that church at 7,000. And he said, Keith, I've heard that you guys have something that is really beginning to help people to learn to do the way of Christian living, not just head knowledge stuff. And it's called membership process. Can you come and tell about it? Well, I was here at this meeting with 28 people in this roundtable, head of Zondervan Publishing. John Ortberg was there, my friend from Willow Creek, roomed with him. He's in charge of teaching transformation on their community, new community nights. Their staff was there around formation. The formation staff or the discipleship staff, they called the maturity team from Saddleback Community Church, the second largest church in the United States along with Willow. And then a couple other churches. But there were representatives from Campus Crusade, Navigators, you name it, on and on and on. And as we talked about this thing, they were very interested in this because most churches and organizations are like taking formation in discipleship and it's off on the side. They're trying to push it in. And what we're doing here is trying to go from the very heart and the soul, from the place that the organization, the heart beats, discipleship and teaching people what Christianity was originally called, before they were even called Christians at Antioch, Little Christ. You know what the believers referred to the Christian life as? the way. Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life. And it wasn't just the way to heaven on a ticket. It was the way of loving heaven now. It was called the way. In fact, that Jewish sect, you'll see it in Acts chapter 19 several times, the way. James, second Peter, talks about the way of righteousness. It's back in the Old Testament. It was the way of God's people, a way of living. Now, that doesn't reduce it down to effort to get into heaven. No, when you receive God's forgiveness, it's not just about the forgiveness of guilt and sin. The word forgive means to let go. And praise God, the scriptures say that salvation is deliverance. So it's not just the death of sin. It is also the power of sin in the life that Jesus delivers us from. And so we're here to say we're going to even be counter-Christian culture and call you into something that might feel a little different. See, membership at other places is pretty easy. You just sign a card, tell your testimony. What we're calling for here is partners who say, we want to learn to become disciples. That's the job number one in our lives. And job number two is helping others become disciples, no matter what your gift is, no matter what place you're in. So how does this program do that? Well, Scott's going to give you in just a second, Scott, a way to learn how people have done that. I just, in a couple minutes before Scott speaks, I want to give you some of the how of this. There are two ways to take it. Scott's going to break that a little bit more. One way is the 15-week course that's at church. It's in small groups that takes a couple hours on an evening, and you just do that for 15 weeks, so you have to come to church or wherever we're offering that. Another way is through videos and materials that you can do with two or more people. Where two or more are gathered, Christ is there. That's the church. So a husband and wife can do this. Two friends can do it at home. You could do it in your community group. They'll tell you how to do that. You could use it there as a curriculum. You could use it as a curriculum for your task group if you're part of a ministry task group. And the whole thing about this is it's not just information. You'll get good information, but it is formational. If you've ever struggled with prayer, and the great secret in the church is that everybody says they pray and they don't. In fact, that's probably the biggest swear word. I'll pray for you. Prayer, you know, you struggle with that? I struggled with that for many years. Adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication. And it felt so impersonal. And there were times of worship where I really got there. I felt like it touched God. There's a way to pray that we'd love to talk to you about that feels just as good as sitting with your wife or your friend on a couch saying nothing. It's called the prayer union. And it's called practicing the presence. We are doing this not in a large group alone together format, like lecture. There are lectures. But it's in community, in groups of two or more, or in these small groups. And there you can share your journey, your experiences, what you're experiencing as you're learning these things. It's not an end, but it's the beginning of a journey together. And it isn't going to make anything of you by just being there. You're going to have to participate and put forth the effort. But it's minimal, just a few minutes a day, and then just some time once a week where you gather for the group session, alone and then together. And this isn't just a one-time process. The reason we're doing renewal is, like Dave said, the other membership processes we've looked at are all contract for church services in your nickels and noses. Okay? This is a covenant parting relationship which like any relationship needs continual dialogue so that that relationship is affirmed and renewed by both parties, the church and you. Every two years in an evening where Dave and I will be goofy and, you know, everything and share some next steps that we see the church going into and then we want to hear from you. You'll have some time to fill out some forms before you come to that to tell us what you hear and see. See, that doesn't happen in churches. you call and try and get somebody to talk to you so we're going to regularly ask you to do that and then there will be times for you to review some of the materials from the journey Scott will talk about so it's a relationship now this is just huge when Jesus did give this command all authority I have given you and then he left it was just like what a setup you're telling us to go and make disciples and you're going to leave he said well I'm going to be with you always some doubted some were really afraid some were just overwhelmed What a wonderful thing. He told his disciples in the upper room and gave them this promise. He said, I have called you servants because that's what they were. They'd become servants not to idols and to other people or to themselves, but to Jesus Christ, their master. But he says, I no longer just call you servants. I now call you friends. And really in the Greek there, it means kingdom partners. Isn't that interesting? When he had trained up his disciples, they were now partners of his. He says, ask whatever you will and I'll do it. Because you know the Father's business. I think we know the Father's business, making disciples, right? Becoming disciples. That's the business. So he calls us to that. But what a promise in that overwhelming task. Because Jesus says, and lo, I will be with you always. I'll even sit on the couch with you and teach you what you need to do. You want to enter that journey. That's what we're calling you to. Scott's going to come and share a little bit more about that. I'm going to just give you a few practicals on how to become involved in this pathway of transformation. And quite simply, more of the information is available at the information booth in the back. And also you can attend the forum in between services. Those of you who are existing members do not need to go through the journey or the next step. However, we would invite you to be a part of that. you can do that either through a class, or you can check out videos, and they will be available on Monday. And we are going to give the existing members the first option of checking out the videos, so that you could participate through that means. And what you can do is, as Keith pointed out, you can do it with a small group that you're already in, a task group that you're involved with. You can do it as a couple. But we ask you to do it in relationship with someone, because we find that there is a two-way holy listening process that takes place. There's the holy listening that we do with God, and there's the holy listening that we do with one another. And that starts to expand how we see God and how God intersects our life. So we ask you to do it in relationship with some other people. So existing members, we invite you to participate in that way. And then if you have never become a member at Open Door, we would strongly encourage you to go through a class setting and do it live. And you're going to build some significant relationships in that process, and you're going to be able to journey together. Somebody asked about the next step being a prerequisite, and it is, and starting in the fall, it will be offered every three weeks. It'll just be cyclical. And then you can jump into the journey when they start to be offered. More of that information is available on this sheet, membership process summary, and you can pick that up. If you want to know when the dates are, you can also sign up at the information booth because we'll notify you of when the classes are being offered, and then you can decide if you want to check in at that point. that's enough on the kind of the mechanics. How in the world did we arrive here? And you've been hearing Dave unpack that, and you've heard Keith unpack that. And it's a passion of ours. This is not something that is kind of a tag on. It's becoming central to everything that we're about. And as a senior staff, we have been talking about this for quite a while. And I am a part of a group that meets 46 weeks a year at least. And it is known as the senior staff. Now if you ever were able to have a webcam in that room, and you could watch us, there would be weeks that you would go, I am never returning to that place again. I cannot believe this. I mean, obviously that group needs a lot of transformation. And you could witness that this morning on the video. The poor guy holding the sign, and the truck splashing the water, if that is the life of Christ we need help here I mean to tell you and singing eagle stuff it drives us as a staff to pray a lot a lot we have hysterical moments I mean unbelievable moments and then there are those times where we share and the tears start to flow around the table and we start to listen in that holy way to what God is saying and what God is saying through others. And we are realizing that the life of God is being uncovered in us. And what has become defined as a moment, and there have been several moments on our staff, but one of those defining moments is when we decided we would put our swords on the table like the knights of old. And we would say we would be here for one another in deeper and more profound ways. that we were not just Christian professionals who are gifted in administration and teaching and preaching and who are very innovative with programming for kids and youth and who do an amazing thing around care and all of the various things that we do around here and leading worship that flow out of our giftedness. We are more than Christian professionals and we needed to more fully lean into the profession of Christ and the claims of Christ on our lives. And we needed to enter into a deeper walk of transformation to take and be willing to say yes in those areas where we are resistant, to open our lives up and say we would be more like Jesus. And as Dave has talked about the fact that he felt that God had said, are no longer leading a parade, but you need to turn around and face the people, we realized that we needed to turn around and we needed to face one another and call out the life of God in one another and be present more fully to God and to one another. And as we have done that, we have realized that that is the very life that we want to call out of anybody who says they're making open door their church home. That membership is not about carrying the card. It's about saying yes to lifelong transformation. That we get the opportunity to actually enter into the kingdom life now that we will literally live for thousands of years to come. Do you realize that? That this isn't some sort of pit stop on our way and that we get a little quick fix with Jesus. This is actually the introductory course to the life that we are going to live uninterrupted for thousands of years to come. And so in that process, we began to explore what would be 12 core beliefs, 12 foundations that are not an end in themselves, but simply a doorway, 12 doorways, as it were, that we will explore for eternity with God. You go on the journey, you're going to be exposed to the very first place where we enter, and it's repentance and forgiveness. And you can't sit with that core belief for very long and not become amazingly grateful for the way that God has dealt with you and forgiven you. But you can't sit very long with that core belief and not realize that there is such a pettiness of soul. How unforgiving I am. How easily ticked I become. how I hold grudges and resentment. And while I willingly want God to come and forgive me, if I acknowledge something, I'm not nearly as quick as God with other people around me. And that there needs to be a work in my soul around repentance and forgiveness. Then you walk into this whole area of deliverance and cleansing and you're faced with the reality of baptism and you realize that it's not just a point, but it's actually a journey. And then you're reminded for some of us who have been baptized, I mean, it was actually more than getting wet. I'm to live in my baptism every day? What does that mean? What does that mean to live as a wet Christian every day? Living in the reality of my baptism every day. And then if you've not been baptized, you've got to face the very words of Jesus, who himself was baptized and then called his followers to be baptized. And the very first call of the church was repent and be baptized. And you need to go, am I actually resisting a transformational place that God is calling me to? Why would I resist what God would want to do in my life? Then you're exposed to the table, the wonderful place, and the encounter with God. And you realize that he sat with his disciples and said, do this in remembrance of me. What does that mean? What does it mean to live as a person who's at the table with Jesus? And to sit down and be a part of that meal with him. And you'll suddenly realize as you're sitting around in your small group in a live setting that you're going to be breaking bread and you're going to be sharing that cup. And how that binds us together. And what does it mean to live in that reality until the day that we are with him and we're at the table with him. Then there will come that point in the fourth session where all of a sudden you're going to be anointing one another with oil as a reminder of the infilling of the Holy Spirit and you can't live within that core belief without all of a sudden going, what does this mean? What does it mean to be being filled with the Spirit? What does it mean to live every day out of the Spirit? Not just out of my own little motivations, not out of my attitudes, but out of attitudes that are shaped by the Spirit of God. And how does this all get worked out in my home, in the place that I work? Ultimately, we end with this absolutely arrogant core belief. We can change the world. Steve Hansen comes in and he blows our hair back. That's why he has so little hair, I think. I mean, he lives in this reality. It's such an arrogant core belief, but you realize suddenly that really, Christ in us, the hope of glory, can impact the world. That we can literally live, as we sang this morning, in all we do, may we honor you. And when we do that, we impact the world and we change the world around us. And that we are the only hope. That we are the only hope. There are amazing things that happen as people are on this journey. Little things that we never realized were going to start to open up for people in this process. One of them is that couples many times going through somewhere between week four and seven are forced into a place of agape love with one another they never thought would happen in membership. Because, you see, they agreed to go through this together, and they were going to share every day. They were going to do their little daily pages, and they were going to pray together. And all of a sudden, the wheels start to drop off, and they realize they do their spiritual lives in different ways. And I love it when spouses come and tattle on the other one. You need to talk to, because we're not, and we agree too. So I wonder if you would just talk to them about that. I go, oh no, you get to talk about it. Agape love, transformational moment right here in your marriage relationship. You're going to get to live out. Then there are those who have many times wondered if God talks at all. I mean, they get to periodically hear God talk through somebody else, but God doesn't talk to me. And as they learn how to sit quietly and open themselves up to be in the presence of God, they hear, oy vey. You know, the Jewish God talking. And that God really just yacky, yacky, yacky, yacky all the time with them. And that he's been talking all the time and they haven't been tuned in. And they're like, my word, it is really a relationship. I mean, this is really a relationship. We have a place called Soul Sketching, and it's where we invite people to draw, and oh, you can tell when people look at that. They're like, oh yeah, draw. Okay, somebody else does that. But we always encourage people, just see what God would do as you start to draw, or cut little things out of a magazine, paste them in there, make a scrapbook out of all of this. And what we've uncovered in that process is that there are people who all of a sudden discovered that there was an artist within, that God starts to talk through even stick figures that they draw. And that they're starting to see new ways of opening themselves to God. And in that process, we had one elder who went through, and every two years when we go through the renewal process, we ask people to go back to their journey journal and to simply review some of the things that they had noted in there and what God has been doing and how they have seen the life of transformation being lived out in their life. And as he was sitting and reviewing it, he was starting to look at the various pictures he had drawn and the things that he had stuck in his book. and all of a sudden his little daughter came and said, Daddy, what are those pictures? And he said, I never realized I was going to have this amazing opportunity to walk through my spiritual life in a way that my daughter could understand as she looked at the pictures and opened my spiritual journey to her. So there are some amazing things that God has been doing in people's lives. Is it a program? Not at all. It's a pathway. Is it an end? it better be a beginning or this is really bad news. This better be lifelong transformation. You may be aware that we actually have what we call around here the four B's. We've broken our values into four B statements. A be real, be long, become and be called. And a woman wrote me this week and she talked about taking her journey journal out and looking at it and it was like holding an old friend. And she was reminiscing about what God had been doing in her life, and she wrote me this. Be real. The journey allowed me a place to be accepted where I'm at in my journey and share concerns and desires. Be long. The journey connected me with others who are committed to an ongoing relationship with God. Become. The journey gave me tools to continue to grow in my journey and help the church grow in its journey and be called. The journey equipped me to serve in the church community and see the gifts that I bring. We call you to this journey. It's a journey that we are on. It's a simple journey that says, follow Jesus. Lean hard into Jesus. Give your best to Jesus. And let his image be stamped deep on your life. Because what is it that we want people to see when they look at us? As a senior staff, we decided that we didn't want people to simply see gifted people. We wanted them to look at us and say how they love one another. We see Jesus. And may it be so that when we live our lives, and as God calls us to this area called Maple Grove, and people begin to find us, that what strikes them is how we love one another, and that they see Jesus all over, all over, emanating out through our lives. Has David told you about a vision that he's had recently? that is the vision that is the vision and I'm a remedial learner I've gone through the journey 10 times so I'm very slow but I'm catching on and in that process I have watched people become more and more the living stones that God is using to build his church in remarkable ways people who carry the presence of God the light of God within that when they fill the place it's illuminated with the presence of God that's what we call you to and we invite you to the journey David as we continue to prepare for the days that are approaching as we move to Maple Grove. There are quite a few things that we do not know. There are challenges that we are going to face that we don't know about. There are needs that are going to present themselves to us in that community that right now we don't know about. I'm sure there will be oppositions that we have faced before and will face again, but some that we don't know about. And there are opportunities, I believe, that are going to open up to us that we are, on one hand, anticipating. On the other hand, I really believe, and we've already tasted some of this, some opportunities that we never dreamt possible in terms of furthering the kingdom. Lots of things we don't know. Here's what we do know. We really care about the formation of your soul. It's exciting to fill the room. It's exciting, and we're going to fill the room where we go. But it's left us really thirsty for more. we care about inviting as many people as want to come we are passionate about inviting as many people as want to come on what i think is the adventure of a lifetime marked by a journey with god and with his people and for many of you that's the added thing here not just all by yourself this is with a group of people a body of people that brings us into the reality of authentic transformation till Christ be formed in us. I'd like us to stand as we're dismissed this morning. Father, as I close, I just have in my mind what I had in my mind when I began the talk this morning. I'm mindful today of journey and our journey and how the things we're speaking of today have always been our concerns. They've always been mine. You're giving us some vehicles where we can flesh these things out into the life of your people. I pray, Father, that you would continue to be the God of our journey and that we would be faithful to respond obediently to what you say to us and where you call us. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
