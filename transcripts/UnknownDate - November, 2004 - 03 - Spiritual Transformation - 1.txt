Well, you are far too kind. It's a wonderful thing to be here, and I do enjoy my work in philosophy. I don't see any big contrast, but the audiences are often greatly contrasting, and that's refreshing. So I'm delighted to be here, and thank you very much. And we're just going to continue on with what we were talking about, because I didn't get done with the vital connection between character and power, I would especially like you to look at Acts 1 with me as we start out now, a very helpful passage on this topic. In the opening of Acts 1, you're looking at a transition that is being completed by Jesus. when he was resurrected, he did not hang around with the apostles, because now he's in a process of teaching them how to communicate with him and be with him while he's not visibly present. So now this is a kind of an interim period, and so he comes into their presence, goes out of their presence and keeps talking with them when he's not visible. And then he comes back and confirms with them what he said to them when he was not visible. So now watch the wording here. And the first thing you want to notice is that in verse 2, he's in this interim period before he's taking up. after he had, by the Holy Spirit, and that's the crucial word there, by the Holy Spirit, given orders to the apostles whom he had chosen. So he's training them how to do that. And so he will speak to them, and they will know this, and they're like the apostles, the guys on the road to Emmaus, you know, you remember what they said? Did not our hearts burn within us? That's the Jesus burn. You learn that by experience. Did not our hearts burn within us when he opened the Scripture as he walked the road? They had to learn the effect of this. And he teaches them, moves in and out of their presence, confirms what he said when he was not present and so on. But he also presented himself alive after his suffering by many convincing proofs. Now if you look at the rundown on this in 1 Corinthians 15, you'll find that there were not a lot of times that he appeared. Just enough, see, he was pulling them, pulling them out of where they were over into where they were going to be. And so he wasn't with them all the time. He was with them just enough to pull them over. So they would now, then they would know, they would know what that's like. And then the conversation would continue. But notice here now in verse 3 what he talked about. What did he speak about in verse 3? The kingdom of God. Same old, same old, right? That's what he always talked about, the kingdom of God. That's the gospel. And I'm going to have to come back now in a little while and bear down on that, but I want you to notice it here. See, we can test our understanding of what the gospel is by looking at the Scriptures and seeing how they carry out the teaching of Jesus. Listen to this just a moment. This is Titus 2.11. The grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, teaching us... Now what comes next? Teaching us that if we trust His death on the cross, we'll go to heaven when we die. Is that what it says? Looky there. I just turned around and it was there. Thank you so much. It's wonderful to have that. Looky here. Peter and Allman, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust, we should live soberly, righteously, godly in this present world, looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem unto himself a peculiar people ready to go to heaven. Zealous of good works. And the good works, you see, are the same ones that in Ephesians 2 it says, we are created unto good works. Remember that? By grace are you saved through faith, that not of yourself, it's the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are his workmanship, created for good works, which it was before ordained that we should live in them, walk in them, you see. Now that's because salvation is essentially life. Salvation is life. Life is a principle of activity that works in you. Anything that is alive has some capacity of self-initiation, self-sustaining, self-directed power. Anything that's alive has that. If it's Todd's palm tree over here or his kitty or whatever it is, anything that's alive has that. There's some degree of that. And when your goldfish goes belly up, you know it's dead. It doesn't have self-initiative, self-sustaining, self-directing power. Now, when the kingdom comes in, that's what it gives you. So, here Jesus said, speaking for 40 days the things concerning the kingdom of God. Gathering them together, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, which, he said, you heard about it from me. For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now. Now, watch what these guys thought when they heard that. They were buzzing this. What's he going to do? What's he going to do? What's about to happen? And so they finally popped it. Are you going to take over now? Are we ready for the pooch? the revolution? Is it going to happen now? Are you going to restore the kingdom to Israel? That meant in their minds that he was actually going to become the governor of Israel and defeat all their enemies and they would get to ride in the inauguration parade. now here's what he said to them it is not for you to know times or epochs which the father has fixed in his own authority but you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you now see this is power without authority power without position they wanted position so they could have power and we all know where that's going to lead that's the human way and we've how many revolutions have we had and the same old same old comes around again no this is power without position but it has to come by you waiting on it you see his preparation of them had come up to a certain point but there was more to do and it was not possible for them to bear the power until they'd had the preparation. It wasn't like they were just sitting around waiting, you know. Something was happening to them. And the period of training that went into this 40 days and then the 10 days to Pentecost was absolutely crucial for what they would be prepared to do because of their character and experience when the power came. now one of the things that you will pick up if you look at the new testament carefully is it's it's there's so much power in it you read paul's writings that's just power power power power power and it's all that's the same thing as grace now because remember grace is god acting to do in our lives what we can't do on our own and if you just turn to ephesians and philippians it's just power, one power after another. But it's always subordinated to character. And that's a teaching that we have to internalize for ourselves. We should be ready to do whatever God wants us to do in His power, but we should also recognize that there are some things we'll not be able to do because we've not come to the place where we can stand that power. Now, just think about it. Suppose you raise someone from the dead. That'll change your life. I sometimes pray for people. I prayed for a man up in Central California sometime back, had some kind of cancer. I was sure something happened, you know, because usually you can tell. And I sort of just got away and didn't. But, you know, that fellow is still sending other people to me to pray for them because he was, for all that we know, healed. Now, I'm sure that other things went into it, but he believes that I am the one that's responsible for his healing. So he's out drumming up work for me. And truthfully, I've got my hands full. I'll still pray for people, but that really isn't my job. But that's the way it works, you see. And you have to be careful about what comes into your life and know who you are and what you're doing and not allow it to throw you off. because you could do other things that you might do. I have people constantly coming and saying, how do you publish a book? I don't know how you publish a book. Every book I've published has been asked for by the publisher. I don't know how. And now, many years ago, when I was what we called a preacher boy in Baylor University, I think that's what they called them down there, probably pretty good. I saw others trying to find places to preach, and the Lord said to me, never try to find a place to preach. Try to have something to say. And so I laid that burden down. And I've never sought like I've never, I never, the job I have have had for so many years. I didn't ask for it. I never asked for promotions. I never asked for salary increases. The Lord brings it. You have to lay that. I'm sorry to talk so much about myself, but maybe it's a good illustration. You just have to lay a bunch of stuff down. You don't touch it. You leave it in God's hand. That's the primary thing of what it means to wait upon the Lord, is you just don't touch a lot of things. And please, I'm not trying to suggest that if you have done these things, it's wrong. Just for me, that's the way it has worked. I don't believe there's a commandment that you should never try to have a place to speak. I don't think that's righteousness or anything. It's just something the Lord said to me. And looking back, I can see that was really important. It taught me something. And see, that's what it means to have power but no kingdom, no place, no position. And I don't seek position precisely because I know now I don't need it. There will be more to do than I can get done. And it was a big change in my life when I realized reading the Gospels, as a young minister would be, at least I was trying, that Jesus spent a lot of time trying to get away from people. And here I was trying to get people to come. I said, there's got to be something different here. And, of course, a big difference was he's Jesus and I'm Dallas. But then I began to realize, you know, I'm really not teaching what he taught, the kingdom. I'm really not doing that. I'm teaching something else. I'm teaching it because my teachers taught me that you can't teach what he taught because it's not for this age. Then I began to realize that dispensationalism has an uncanny ability to say that the things we're not doing are not for now. and now. See, there's so much of the teaching here and I can't give it all but, for example, 1 Peter 5, 5-7. 1 Peter 5, 5-7. Here's a teaching about being humble and about submitting yourself to God. Humble yourself. under the mighty hand of God that in due season he might exalt you. Be submissive to one another. Be clothed with humility, you see. For God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. See, now that's, see, when you think about being filled with the Spirit and being baptized, you don't want to keep all of this together. They're not really talking about different things. They're talking about different dimensions of the same thing, which is life in the kingdom of God. God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble. That grace is God acting with you. So now, as you came down here before lunch and had a wonderful time of prayer and submission and surrender and Todd led you and all of that, see, now what you want to look for as you go forward now is not feeling like that. What you want to look for is God acting around you and within you. That's the reality. So now as you go from this meeting this weekend, or this week or weekend, a little of both, I guess. See, when you step out into your life and you see the places where God should act, give him a break. Give him a time. Give him an expectation. You've got to tangle personal relationship. Don't try to jump on it and straighten it out. There may be something appropriate to say and to do, but watch for the hand of God to move in it. That's the kingdom of God. And these people that Jesus was talking to there, you see, in Acts 1. Saying, no, no, you're going to have power. That's going to come upon you. And when it does, you will be witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, in Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth. And you know what? Maple Grove? Maple what? Maple Grove is a part of the uttermost parts of the earth. Right? You often feel that way? so you to be his witnesses. And that will absolutely work if you go at it in the way that he's talking about it. But you do have to learn that you don't make that happen. You are in place for it to happen. And so now that's why I had said to you before we quit, I wanted you to carry that with you to lunch, that God's intention for each of us is to grow, to become the kind of person that he can empower to do whatever we want. Because what you want is going to be what makes up your life. And if you have got yourself off the throne, and God is on the throne, then what you want is fine. One of the questions I've got here to respond to is someone comments on a friend who had said, love God and do what you want. Actually, that's St. Augustine's word, but it's the truth. Love God and then do what you want and God will bless you in it. Now, that may make you a little uneasy, you see, because you know our wanters need some work. But that's what discipleship is about. That's what we're into here. And that's what we were talking about when we went over things like temptation and what you do with your mind and so on, is that God is changing our wanters. Love God. If you do that right, then you can do what you want. and you don't even need to say, what would Jesus do? Now, Jesus was someone that God could give unlimited power to. And there's some problem with translating John 3.34, but in some of the older versions, King James versions, I think they get it right because the word there is that God can give the Spirit without measure, without measure. Now, me, he has to give it with measure. Again, I'm not Jesus or anything close, and I'm not able to contain all that God could give in the way of his Spirit. But as the Scripture says there, Jesus can receive the Spirit of God without measure. I don't know. Perhaps we are growing towards that. Perhaps we could say that. But for us, we begin with simple things like prayer and giving. Prayer and giving are the first steps in kingdom living. Prayer and giving, they're the things that enable you to experience the kingdom of God enough so that you can begin to trust God enough to do what He said. Prayer and giving are baby steps in the kingdom. And probably it won't apply to anyone who's here, but you know, the rate of simple tithing among Christians is, I think, 2%. And when you think about that, you know, you don't think, oh, poor church, oh, poor preacher. You think, these guys don't know what they're missing. Because giving is an opportunity to involve yourself in the action of the kingdom. When you give to God, you act with Him. You remember that widow with the two pennies? You remember that story? Jesus sitting over here watching people put their money in the collection. and he said something. See, these sayings of Jesus, when you begin to get the kingdom perspective, then all of a sudden a lot of his sayings that don't make any sense begin to make sense. So here he's watching these people putting their big tax-deductible contributions. And now along comes the little lady. She's got two mites, two pennies, all she had. Puts it in. And Jesus said, that woman put in more than all the rest. Now, how could that be true? Well, that would be true because God is going to do something with those two pennies that's greater than what he's going to do with all the rest. See, giving is cooperating with God. It's working with God. It's trusting God. And now these folks that are holding back and not giving, whether it's to the church or to the poor or however that works out, see, essentially they're saying, it's my kingdom and I have to make it work. That's what they're saying. And of course, when they approach it that way, Life confirms what they think, and they never do learn the generosity of God and the greatness of God in response to simply being able to turn loose their possessions. And then prayers. We talked some about that already, and I won't have much time to talk about it in these meetings, I think. But those are ways that we begin to find the kingdom where there is power without position. And the more we find it, the more we're ready to act in the power without the position. Now, if we have a position, we can use that too, but we never act from that position. We act from our position in the kingdom of God. And that means we're acting with God. When we act, we count on God to act. And that brings great peace and great joy because you learn the reality of God and you learn that your life is a part of an undying, never-ceasing reality that is God and what He's doing. Now, as you learn that, then you can stand more power because you don't even think about the things that would lead to the abuse of it. And the more power you can stand, the greater God is glorified. He wants to give us power. That was our calling. That was what his intention was. And that's why Peter says, humble yourself under the mighty hand of God that in due season, do you note that phrase? He will exalt you. When it's right, God will know when it's right. So I try not to give him a bad time if I feel like I need power and he's not giving it. Say, well, God knows best about these things. I don't hesitate to ask for it. That's the role that we can live in. We can ask for it. I don't hesitate to do that. But I don't get depressed. I don't feel that failure has happened because I've committed my way to God. I'm counting on Him. As far as I know, I'm doing what He wants me to do. And so I let it rest there. Again, you see, that's an effect of not having the position and power coming from the position. If I have a position, the power still comes from God. It's his business. He's building his church. I am not building his church. He's building it. So now I just finished up this morning's talk. Okay. So now you can go on to the next thing on your schedule. Really, this afternoon I was just going to talk about basically the contents of the book. on the renovation of the heart and try to get some of the central concepts that are there and that I think we really need. So let's go on now and think about this process that I described as Christian spiritual transformation. And let's try to think about how it happens. And I want to give you a general pattern of personal change. Now, this isn't just for spiritual transformation. It works in many areas of life, and I call it the Vim pattern. Vim is a Latin word, actually. we talk about vim and viga. It goes with the Latin word viz, which means something like life or impulse or power. This is the accusative case, if you're interested in grammar. But it works like this, vim. vision. That's the first element in spiritual growth. And that's the reason why most people don't grow spiritually. It also explains, for example, why, for example, here in the United States, we do an awful job teaching foreign languages in our schools. It isn't because we don't have the equipment. At USC, we have a whole floor of one building best equipment you can imagine for teaching languages and some kids learn it but most of them get their grades and go out and they couldn't say or whatever you know in any language so they don't have a vision of the goodness of knowing how to speak the language same thing is true of saving money losing weight any of it all these things that we buy stuff to help us with and then do nothing with we don't have the vision of the goodness of the condition anyone who has a vision of losing weight they can lose weight they have to have more than the vision but they've got to have the vision of the goodness of it And once they get that, then they can move on to intention. And intention, again, is absolutely essential for change. Like if you wanted to love your enemies, you would have to decide you're going to do it. You'd have to intend it. If you don't intend it, you'll never learn it. That's true of all the teachings of Jesus. If you'd like to learn how to pray more effectively, you can do that. Everyone can do it. But if you talk to the ordinary person when they get into that area of prayer, you're probably going to find that they have never decided to devote their life to that. They've never said, I'm going to do this, and I'm going to subordinate everything else to this. And probably that's because they have not subordinated everything else to Jesus. Jesus, you remember, in Luke 14 says, unless you... It's hard to get language that will do. He said, good translation is hate or despise your mother and your father and your sister your brother and so on and your own life also you cannot be my disciple now you don't need to be told he was not suggesting you should hate your parents this is a emphatic or very graphic way of saying simply this has to be the most important thing in your life take your cross and your cross is not some unfortunate circumstance that has happened to you, by the way. Peter Cartwright preached on this verse and he was going, he was a Methodist circuit writer and he was going to his next meeting and he found a small man carrying a large woman. And he said, why are you doing this? They said, the man said, you told me I had to take up my cross and carry it. Now, that was not his cross. Your cross is self-denial. It isn't an unfortunate circumstance that happens to you. Because among other things, it's something you gladly assume. and unfortunate circumstances. You can accept them well if you have the cross in place. But primarily, learning the cross and all the commands and all that, we have to intend to do that. And this is where, because the vision is not clear, the intention fails, and we really don't have resolute discipleship. If you have a vision of life in the kingdom of God now, and this appears to you to be the best thing you've ever seen. Todd was talking about the pearls and the field and all of that. See, those parables, they go along with the teaching about if you don't take your cross. They're the positive sign. The man, the pearl merchant, did not bemoan his little pearls. see because he knew that he was getting something much better and that's that's the positive side of this the man did not bemoan having to sell his cow to buy the field that had the oil well in it because he that's the vision part see you say how do you make a disciple you ravish them with a vision of life in the kingdom of God. And you do that by presenting Jesus and what he was and what he offers. And people just say, man, that's the pearl of great price right there. That's the field with the treasure in it. I'm going to buy that. Taking your cross is not a lugubrious, sober, sickening experience. It is a liberating experience. But you have to have the vision. Now, if you have that vision, then you can form the intention. So what am I going to spend the rest of my life doing once I get the vision? Well, I have to decide I want to go the way of the vision. And then I say, now, my intention is to be Jesus' disciple for the rest of my life. And so as a disciple of Jesus, I am arranging and rearranging my affairs to be with Him, to learn to be like Him. And when I go in, I don't know all that it means. That's why I have to grow and revise and change things and often I come on things I didn't even know was there. You know, God doesn't let us see everything at once. And that's a real good thing. Because if you saw everything at once you needed to change, it'd probably just, you'd throw up your hands and walk off. So He opens one door after another and we come to the things that might be most difficult when we have gotten in a position to deal with them because of what we've already gained. So now the Vim, the Im, you've probably already guessed it, means. Now once you have the vision and you have the intention and of course the intention spells itself out in decision, then you find means. Because when you begin to walk after Christ and with Christ, you have a lot of failures. That's natural, normal. It's like when they teach you to ski, that one of the first things they teach you is how to fall because they know you're going to fall. And it's dangerous. So you need to know how to do that. And once you implement the vision that you've been given of life in the kingdom and you begin to apply it to particular things, there will be failures. Now then, when you have failures, you don't quit. You find out what went wrong and you fix that and then you try again. Right? So the rule in the kingdom is not if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. The rule is, if at first you don't succeed, find out why you failed, change that, and then try again. I sometime back had a man from Jet Propulsion Lab in a meeting and he said, when we blow up a rocket, we don't try, try again. We try to find out why the rocket blew up. Then we fix it and we try again. May blow up again, but at least we're making progress. And that's the nature of life. That's the nature of life in the kingdom. When we look at the teachings of Jesus, we always want to remember that. Yes, of course, try that. And then, if it doesn't go through, find out why it didn't. That will always push us deeper into this process of spiritual transformation. Now, you know our time is going to be wasted here if you don't put this into practice. Your time is going to be wasted here. So, as I go along talking about these things, I beg you to be thinking about things you're going to try, the experiments that you're going to make. And it may have to do with a lot of different things, a job, family, some particular aspect of your devotion to Christ that may be Scripture memorization. But be thinking about things that you're willing to try. And see if you can begin to find out the things that will really do good. There are a lot of things to be said about all these, and I will get some of it said. But one of the most important things to know here is this is not righteousness. It is not law. It's wisdom. The means you involve, that's wisdom. So, to go back to the case of memorization again, I mean, suppose you try to memorize Colossians 3, 1 through 17, and for whatever reason, it just doesn't work. Well, don't feel guilty. You didn't sin. See, there's a lot of stuff in our life that isn't as it should be, that is not sin. Does that make any sense? You remember that in Hebrews 12, the word says, laying aside every weight and the sin that doth so easily beset us. Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of God. Okay, there are sins, and then there's weights. And we really need to recognize the difference. And much that holds us back is weights. It might be all kinds of things, but they're just weights. and we need to know how to lay them aside. Lay aside the weight and the sin. Now, if you are not able to memorize that passage, I would say with almost certainty it isn't sin that's keeping you from it. And if you go the sin route, you will misunderstand what the hindrance is and won't be able to deal with it. But yet we're so used to this that we just, if something doesn't go as it should, then we just feel like we ought to beat ourselves and say, oh, you miserable, wretched sinner. Well, you may be that too, I don't know. But that's not always the problem. Often the problem is we don't have wisdom. So now just to stay with the case and the illustration here, if you were trying to memorize that passage, the intelligent and godly thing to do is to find out what keeps you from succeeding with it. What are some of the things that might be keeping you from succeeding with it? Well, some of the things might be things, I have people all the time saying, I can't memorize. And they have that setting in there, and so that deflects everything. Now let me tell you, everyone can memorize. Memorization is not a mysterious, difficult thing. To memorization, you need three things in some kind of balance. You need repetition. That's important. You need understanding. you need understanding and you need concentration. If you can do those three things you can memorize. Anyone can memorize. So now then you find out what are you lacking. You might be lacking concentration. There's a lot of you might have the television on. That's going to make a difference. or perhaps you were tired and repetition put you to sleep. Well, you need rest. And rest is a good thing and you should have it. But you can find out why it doesn't work. I guarantee you anyone can memorize. But if they don't have the vision of the goodness of it and have made the decision and they're not intelligently applying the means, it won't work. If you'd like to be able to bless those who curse you, you can do that. But if you're going to do that, you have to have a vision of why that's a good thing. You have to have decided to do it. And you have to have employed the means, which would mean, among other things, that your body isn't going to curse them before you start thinking. So now that may mean that you're going to have to give your body a little training in solitude and silence to get yourself into a position where it's not running 20 feet ahead of you. You know, you talk about overdriving your headlights. That's when you're driving so fast that you can't see what is within the distance that you can stop. And much of our life is lived like that. We have to slow down. And you can almost say without any qualification to anyone who's getting serious about this, slow down. Don't go so fast. and one of our ambitions should be to eliminate hurry from our lives. Just walk off from it. You can. You can do that. Now, you can still act fast and not hurry. Hurry is an attitude. But if you aren't careful and you start acting fast, you'll start trusting how fast you can act. And that'll get you over the speed limit real fast. You need to be able to slow down. take the hurry out, then go back to blessing those who curse you. Suppose you had to explain blessing those who curse you to someone. Suppose you're teaching Sunday school and a child asks you, what is that? You said, Jesus said, bless those who curse you. And by the way, you know, kids get a lot of cursing. I don't know how much time you may spend around a junior high playground. It's pretty brutal. And not all the cursing is with God's name, but the name calling and all of that, that goes into cursing. You ever hear those words like dork? You know dork? Boy, that's a real brutal word for a kid. And often dork is associated with other attributes that are not good. Now, suppose you have a child that's being called a dork. How would you explain to them what the teaching is, bless those who curse you? Could you do that? Now, this is a good thing to grow on, okay? So maybe take it as an assignment. Between now and Sunday, try to figure out what it means to bless those who curse you. Well, I'm going to tell you so you don't get a chance. when you bless someone you will explicitly will good for them we're back to good and love now you will their good under the invocation of God that's why normally we say God bless you we're getting out of what we can do and we're invoking God to bless this person. It means to will their good explicitly under the invocation of God. That's what you do when you bless someone. Now, of course, you can bless people who don't curse you. That's good too. Blessing is a wonderful thing to do to people. We should be about it all the time. But blessing those who would just, you know, you don't need to get sticky about cursing. Someone who just wishes you'd drop dead would be good enough. Someone who just wishes they'd never see you again. We get a lot of that, don't we? If you drive, you have many opportunities to practice blessing those who curse you. And sometimes it's just a symbol or something. They don't even say anything. They don't even say anything, right? So now, when that happens, your body has to be ready not to whoosh cursing back at them. That would mean, among other things, that you would be in a position to receive what they're giving you in a way that you're not injured. Where can you stand that you're not injured when someone curses you? you have to be standing in the kingdom, don't you? You have to be standing in a place where you can recognize this is nothing. I'm in God's hands. They can curse all they want. My blessing is from God. It's secure. It's not going to be diminished by this person who is unhappy with me about something and is giving me that kind of treatment. So, we find the means to be in a position to bless. Well, how would we do that? Hey, maybe you've been memorizing Colossians 3, 1 through 17. Now, let me ask you, I know some of you have been toying with this and working with it. Don't you feel very differently as those words take possession of you? you see that's real substance and if your mind is saturated with that you're not even going to want to curse people who curse you you're going to want to bless them because you're experiencing such goodness in god's kingdom that you just want to reach out to them and help them now if you're living over here in this deprived little narrow place where you wonder if you have enough to get by and well and then along comes this person and curses me. Well then I'm ready to say, yeah and you too! Or something uglier than that. But if I'm living in the abundance of the risen life with Christ why should I curse them? They need blessing. The very fact that they're cursing me shows that they're needy. Isn't that right? They're needy. And even if it's a family member that I love and I'm very... Do you know this actually happens in families? People curse one another. Even there where it's intimate and hurts all the worse if I'm standing firm then I can return blessing for cursing. But I have to have the means to do that. I won't use the means unless I have the intention. I won't form the intention unless I have the vision of the goodness of it. Now this absolutely works. It really works. And now if you want to look into it in more detail, I've laid this out in chapter 5, The Renovation of the Heart. I'm not trying to sell books, but I can't say it all here. And if you want to go into this deeper and look at it in terms of not only religion, but how that's built into human nature, this works, well then I talk about it a great deal more there. Now, I think we're at the end of this session, so don't go too far and come back and I'll talk a little bit more about the dimensions of the self and how they change as we implement the Vim pattern. Bye-bye. Come back.
