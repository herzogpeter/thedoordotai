We are entering today our 13th week of study in the Ten Commandments. Today is our second week of study in the Seventh Commandment, recorded for us in Exodus 20, verse 14. You shall not commit adultery. God, in effect, is saying here this. I'm putting a boundary around your sexuality. That boundary is fidelity. Its purpose is to protect your marriage. and your children in that marriage and your children's children for generations. The picture is wonderful to me. Picture in your mind a wall. The wall is fidelity. It is surrounding the precious jewel of your marriage. To adulterate, we discovered last week, simply means this, to contaminate or to make impure. Literally, to add to the mix a foreign element. In the case of marriage, the foreign element, the ingredient that doesn't belong, is another person. Often, but not always, adultery includes sexual activity. Not always, because we discovered last week that emotional attachment can sometimes be just as adulterous as sexual activity. Why? Because you have allowed into your marriage a foreign element, an ingredient that doesn't belong. 1 Corinthians 7, verse 28, the Apostle Paul says that about marriage, we need to know this, that even if your marriage is a good one, it's going to be commonly characterized by trouble. In fact, what he literally says is, you will have trouble. It's a very encouraging thought. Paul is a hopeless romantic, always trying to give you the positive side, enticing you to marry. Here's the deal, you're going to have trouble. The Greek word for trouble is phlipsis. It literally means to press together, making trouble as the translation, in my mind, more of an interpretation than a translation. It just occurs to me that they just figured that when you press two people together, you get trouble. Thus, that translation. It doesn't necessarily mean, it means to press together. That's literally what it means. When I back off of the word trouble, just let the Greek sit there, it occurs to me that being pressed together is not entirely unpleasant. There are generally two things that happen when you press together a husband and a wife. The first thing feels good, actually. It's exciting. It's very pleasurable. It's why we have four kids. That's where I'm going with that. And the fact is this, if you don't feel some of that pleasurable stuff somewhere along the line, you wouldn't have gotten married in the first place. But the second thing you get when you press two people together is not just pleasure, you get friction. Why? Simply this, two opinions, two perspectives, two personalities, two ways of doing life. And when you have those two things going on, they begin to rub. And sometimes the rubbing feels real good. And sometimes you begin to rub that person what we call the wrong way. Literally, Paul says it this way. You will have trouble flips us in this life. The Greek word for life is sarx. And the translation really isn't life. It's flesh. And what it means is this. You will have trouble because of your humanity. It's not two evil, vile people getting married because they're so evil and vile they've got problems. It's not that at all. It's this. You just have two human beings. And when you press two human beings, you have their faults and have their good sides. But when you press them together, what you press together is their humanity. And when their humanity presses together, it feels good. And other times it doesn't. It rubs wrong. It creates friction. Now, while this friction doesn't feel good, it's a good thing. Indeed, it's a sanctifying thing. Some of us went into marriage believing that the way marriage was going to feel was good all the time. and when you begin to have some friction, there must be something wrong with us. Here's what's wrong with us. You are a human being. If you could cure that, you could cure the friction. Every once in a while I do run into a couple who maybe even hear something like this and says, you need to understand we've never had a crossword. We've never had a fight. We've never had a disagreement. And I nod and I go, maybe from outer space. But I think of two opinions, personalities, two directions, two ways of doing life. And if you've never had a disagreement, I think one of you probably doesn't have an opinion. It's like, we've never had a cross-through word. Isn't that right there? Yes, dear, that's right. Here's the deal about flipsis, about friction that is inevitable. I believe that a marriage, because of this rubbing together thing, is one of God's greatest tools for your sanctification. Why? Because as two people press together over time, all the issues of your life are going to get exposed. And, you know, we get married and it's just, I just love you so much. I love her and she loves me. It's just all so excited. And what God knows is he's going to press these two dear people together and it's going to feel good. And then there's going to be friction. And then they're going to wonder what. And God, the whole time, he's got this big grin on his face. This is the best thing I got going for their sanctification if they stay in the process. See, what happens is all of your selfishness that nobody confronted you for when you were living alone, somebody starts confronting you for when you live with your husband or your wife. And all of your narcissism and all of your manipulation and need to control compulsions and obsessions get revealed. And it's not as though your spouse, though they would like sometimes to take this posture, It's not as though your spouse can go, huh, you are selfish, narcissistic, a manipulative control freak. They do that. But the real problem is your selfishness started rubbing up against his or hers. Both of them are selfish. Both of them are narcissists. Both of them are control freaks. Both of them are manipulative. And they're just not getting their way anymore. They're rubbing up against the other persons. Again, we love to say, it's you. Now it's you. It's this. That's what this is. and in a context where two people love each other and there is grace, truth and heavy doses of humility where people have the courage to own their stuff and forgive the other in that kind of context people grow beloved marriage I believe where two people are allowing themselves to be pressed together in this way is one of God's greatest tools for your transformation for Christ being formed in you. My dad, who's kind of a romantic like Paul, used to liken marriage to two hunks of meat. It's like two big hunks of meat, tough and grisly. You throw them into a steamer, you throw them into a presser cooker, you clamp down the lid and God turns up the heat. Doesn't this sound delightful? You know, this is the pre-marriage talk my dad has with me. I was excited before I talked to him and then he says those two pieces of tough I want to do it my way meat and by the way boy you are one of those pieces if those two pieces of tough grizzly meat treat each other with love, respect, honesty and grace and boy if they stay in the pot over time they will get tender and juices begin to flow together and one flesh becomes real but you have to stay in the pot here's the deal one man one woman nobody else Imagine now, however, into that mix of the flipsis that every marriage is, you add to that mix, especially maybe when the heat is high, a foreign element. in the middle of your friction at home, which happens to everybody, there's this guy at work who really understands me. He listens. Or there's this woman who actually seems to respect me and doesn't think I'm a total loser. And while I'm having normal tension over here, what I'm experiencing over here is no friction, no tension, all pleasure. By the way, if you're experiencing something like that right now, Let me tell you why you're experiencing no friction, all pleasure over here with Mr. Wonderful or Miss America. It's because you don't have to do real life with this person over here. You got no bills, no kids, no in-laws, no dirty dishes, no history of hurt. And suddenly, miraculously, this foreign element, this other person has provided for you a way out. You actually come to believe something that is not true. What you come to believe is this. And what I believe is maybe even a demonically empowered lie. You believe this. That if you leave this pot and go to this pot in this pot, there will be no friction, no pressure, no trouble. Because right now, you feel none of those things. Only over here in my dirty, rotten marriage. I cannot tell you how often I have seen this dynamic at work. A couple is going through a season of turmoil, but they're doing their work. They're staying in the pot. They're going toward each other. Their work, you need to know this, is normal. One of the most liberating things you could know about a marriage is that the flipsist thing is a normal thing. It is a sanctifying thing. So it's normal. Everybody's got it. By the way, just a little side note. By normal, I am not including someone who is getting physically assaulted. That is not normal. If you are being physically assaulted, I read about it in the paper every day, get out of that pot. I'm not even necessarily saying there, get divorced. But get separated. Get safe. I am talking about people who are reasonably safe. To be in the pot with, you're going through some trouble. But what I've seen is this, and you've seen it too. Suddenly, in the middle of their flipsis, which is normal, one of the two quit. They just quit. They don't want to do the work anymore. Every time I see that, I smell something. Sometimes I'm wrong about this, but almost every single time, I'm not. What I smell is a foreign element. What do you mean? What I believe is this, that when you're going through normal trouble and one of them finally quits and they don't want to do the work anymore, generally, not always, but generally, what's given them the freedom, and I put that in quotes, to not do the work anymore is that they found something over here that's felt like a pressure valve, a release to the pressure. May not be sexual involvement yet. And by the way, that's one of the dangerous things because some of you think that because you're not sexually involved with this person over here that is right now a foreign element in your marriage keeping you from going toward your husband or toward your wife, you think that because it's not sexual, it's not adulterer, you have a foreign element, an ingredient in your marriage that does not belong. And what it's doing is sabotaging the God-intended sanctifying process of flipsis, of friction. You don't have to stay in it anymore because now you can go to Mr. Wonderful, Miss America. Word of warning to those of you who may be in the middle of this kind of thing right now. If you leave your marriage for the lie of the greener grass, You will eventually have the same friction with Mr. Wonderful as you are having right now with Mr. Potato Head. Who, by the way, a few years ago used to be Mr. Wonderful. And I promise you the new Mr. Wonderful, when you get into the path of the new marriage where everything is wonderful, Mr. Wonderful will turn into Mr. Potato Head as well. Indeed, the divorce rate among people who marry the person they had an affair with is up over 80%, which means this. Your chance of having a lasting relationship with this person that you thought was going to solve all your flipsist stuff over here is slim and none. Why? Here's why. Because all marriages have flipsist. Friction. and until you are willing to press through the reality of that and come out the other side to sanctification and one flesh reality, until you're willing to press through that, you have absolutely no chance of ever having a lasting relationship with anybody. Now, I told you last week that there were four things I wanted to touch on, four reasons that I wanted to deal with this adultery thing at some length. Let's get back to that. The first reason is because of adultery's pervasiveness, meaning all of us have been by adultery affected in some way. Even if you've never committed adultery, the ripple effects of this issue are staggering. Second reason is because of the culture's permissiveness. Beyond accepting adultery, we live in a culture that promotes it, making it, quite frankly, much harder to stay in the pot and press through our normal friction because the option of adultery in our culture has become more and more viable. Third reason, and this is what we're going to deal with today, I won't even get to the fourth, it's because of adultery's painfulness. Let me read to you one man's experience. the silence of my study was interrupted by the persistent ringing of the telephone a long time friend from a distant city was calling I'm sorry Don but I have some bad news for you one of your people has been deeply involved in sin for many years the whole sordid story is just beginning to surface here and I thought I'd call you so that you could deal with it there before it comes to you second hand I listened as he described a long series of events with all the confirming evidence that was needed it was not just one of my people it was one of my dear friends it was one of my staff that had fallen into adultery. When he finished, I replaced the phone, sat in stunned disbelief for a few moments, laid my head on my desk, and began to cry. The ringing telephone and the faraway voice that early morning shattered more than the stillness in my quiet office, much more. My brother, my friend, my colleague in the ministry was leading a double life and had been for years. But now it was over, and his world was about to come crashing down. So was ours. Now we tell his wife. But how does a man tell his loving wife that he's been unfaithful to her, repeatedly, over a period of 13 years? Not just any man, a Christian man, a Christian minister, whose total life had been committed to sharing and displaying the holy nature of a holy God. A man whose position of trust had made such actions unthinkable, whose life had been used as a model for others. I was about to learn the answer to that question. Diane was a little startled to see me at the door at that hour. Her apprehension noticeably grew as I told her that her husband was in my car, that we needed to talk while we could be alone and uninterrupted. She and Greg climbed into the rear seat of my car and sat in stunned silence. Suddenly he broke into deep and convulsive sobs, took Diane in his arms, buried his head in her shoulder, and said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I am so sorry. Diane said nothing. I've been unfaithful to you, he finally managed to say. Unfaithful, I've been living a lie for 13 years with a number of women. I am so sorry and so ashamed. Diane stiffened just momentarily and then without a word, wrapped both arms tightly around her husband, drew him close to her, cradled him like a baby, and said, I can forgive you, Greg, I love you. Greg, I love you. Greg. Greg. Went away. No more pain. But during the hours and days that followed, Diane's emotional anesthetic wore off. She experienced incredible anger, bitterness, and self-pity. Various incidents would come to mind that had always been remembered as wonderful in happy times with many of her close friends. As she recalled them carefully, she would realize that those happy occasions had often been used by her husband and by her friends as opportunities for infidelity. Her contented past seemed to be more and more obscured with an ugly awareness that she had been deceived, betrayed, cheated, and wronged. The past 13 years blurred into one long nightmare as she saw Greg and his sin in every memory she had. She found herself turning even the most innocent events into ugly experiences until finally there were no longer any happy memories at all. You see, regardless of what our culture says about adultery's acceptability, indeed its value, the fact remains that with adultery comes an enormous amount of pain. The question I want to deal with for the rest of the morning is this. Why? Why is the cost so high? Why is the pain so great? A little over six years ago, I did a series of sermons born of Acts chapter 15 that I called the pain of porneia. Porneia is the Greek word for fornication. Fornication means simply this, voluntary sexual relations between a man and a woman outside the context of marriage. That includes premarital sex and extramarital sex, which is what adultery is. The focus of that study was not simply to establish and declare the sin of pornea, though we did that. Rather, we focus more, however, on dealing with and wondering about the pain of pornea. Why is this thing that our culture is trying so hard to say is okay, so painful, and so costly? Well, the answer to that we discovered six years ago is due, at least in part, to some critical things about our sexuality that most of us just don't know. And if we know, we don't believe. And while I don't have the desire or the time to revisit that entire series, I think we spent close to 12 weeks on that, I do want to revisit this morning at least two lies about our sexuality that if we believe them leaves us incredibly vulnerable to the pain of pornea and the pain of adultery. Lie number one is this, that all sex is, is a biological urge. All it is is a physical function. You see, if all sex is is a physical urge that I just need to follow, then who cares if I have sex with you or you or you? I mean, if all it is is a biological thing, it's just a physical thing, no big deal. If all sex is is a physical function, then why would a spouse feel devastated when you do have sex with him and her or her? It's just physical. Truth number one, injected into lie number one, is this. that our sexuality in its essence is not simply physical or biological. In its essence, it is spiritual. Now, I understand, know fully well, that in its expression, our sexuality is physical, obviously. I need you to understand, however, that at the core, our sexuality is spiritual. Let me explain. 1 Corinthians 6. Paul is dealing with this very issue, and he tries to give some evidence of this and tries to explain it. In verse 16, he says, Don't you know that he who joins himself to a harlot is one body with her, for the two shall become one flesh. Whatever else that verse means, what Paul is driving at is this. When you engage in physical sexuality, when you touch at that level, you just need to know that something more is going on than skin touching skin. Two become one. A one mess happens, which means it's beyond mere physical expression. There's a spiritual union. In verse 17, he goes as far as to compare the union between a man and a woman with a union between a believer and Christ. Ephesians 5.32 says this mystery of union between men and women as being a picture of our union with Christ is great. It's a great mystery, meaning it's hard to comprehend. But what we need to understand is that our sexuality is more than a physical expression. it is at its core a spiritual union where two people become one flesh and something happens there spiritually. In 1 Corinthians 6.13 Paul gives this analogy to try to help us further get the picture when he says this. Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food. It's a weird thing to say. Basically it's food and stomach. Those things were made for each other But the body, though it was made for sexuality, was not made for immorality or porneia. It was made for the Lord. Let me untangle that, say it as simply as I can. Start with the stomach illustration. Consistent with the design of your stomach is food. So what? Eat. Okay? Likewise, consistent with the design of your body is sexuality. So have sex. But your body, while it was designed for sexuality, was not designed for immorality. Indeed, your body, your life, will not run well on porneia. Why? Because whether you understand it or not, or believe it or not, more is involved in your sexuality than that which is biological. It's not just a physical expression. it's a spiritual union. We live in a culture that knows a lot about the physical dimensions of sex. I grew up in the sexual revolution. There was a lot of things we didn't know about sex and the sexual revolution came around and told us everything we wanted to know about sex and then some. Our kids get sex education. And what they are taught are mechanics, how the body works, what you call the body parts. People get interested in the technique and the how-to stuff. What our culture still knows very little or nothing about, even in the sea of sexual freedom and knowledge, what we still know nothing about is this, that when we express our sexuality physically, something more than the physical is touched, something more than genitals are involved. It touches your spirit. It involves your soul, and that is why adultery is so painful. And that is why sexual abuse and rape is so damaging. Think with me about this. It's awful, but I want you to think about rape. I want you to think about physical assault. I want you to compare the two instinctively. We know this. even in our jaded culture that has tried to reduce sex to simple biology even that culture still reacts more aversively to rape than assault and it should why? here's why I believe because even though we've tried to deny it built into the fabric of our spirits is an instinctive awareness that more is involved in our sexuality than skin to skin. If someone here today was pulled out of their car after church or sometime during the week, and it was a friend of yours, and you heard that they got pulled, and they got pummeled, and they were assaulted, and they ended up in the hospital, you would be appalled, and you should be appalled, and you would become indignant, and you'd want that guy arrested and thrown in jail. If, however, you also heard that not just some guy got out, got pulled out of a car and got beat up, but some friend of yours, a woman friend of yours, got pulled out of a car, beat up, and raped. This is a very indelicate thing to talk about, but I think your reaction would be even more violent. Don't get in jail. Kill that guy. Something would rise up in you, and it ought to. What is that about? I think it's about an instinct. I think it's about an instinct that those of us who are still trying to deny the spiritual dimension of sex still know, and that is this. something's more involved than skin to skin. When that truth is not known, or when it is denied, all you have left, the truth being that something more than skin to skin is involved, spiritual things are involved, but if you don't believe that, all you have left is physical sex. All you have left is genital expression. And the result of that is this, what we have in our culture, a preoccupation with the best technique, the lifelong quest for the ultimate experience and the perfect partner, And the belief that adultery is no big deal. Why? Well, it's just skin to skin. I was just kind of fooling around, honey. In fact, last week we heard, remember, that some adultery is healthy. Remember that? You believe that and you believe it to your peril. Because whether you understand or believe in the spiritual dimensions of sex, When you violate it, you will, in your person and in your marriage, pay an extremely high price. And I'm trying to call you back. Second lie we believe that enters us into the pain of porne and the pain of adultery is this, that sex is a biological need over which I have no control. If sex is a biological need over which I have no control, then I can chase after her or him, and it's just not my fault. It's just a biological thing. I can't help myself, you understand. It's biological. Fact is this. Sex clearly is biological. I know that. Testosterone, estrogen, our mix of hormones, those things are real. And among us in this room is a variance as it relates to sexual desire and sexual drive. It's biological. True. What's the lie is this. Believing that because it's biological, I have no control. I am not responsible. See, basically, I'm like a bull moose in rut. And I just smell it. I just have to go there. And if I go, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's not my fault. I just have to go. I can't help this biological. You know what I mean? It's weird. If you follow that thinking, the man or the woman who's just following their, well, I couldn't help it. No, I'm the victim. I'm doing it, but I'm the victim because I couldn't help it. That's a lie. It's a lie. You know what? It's not that evil people fall into that. People who believe the lie fall into that. This lie and this way of thinking affects things like adultery because if you believe this, then you can't be expected to be faithful. Why? Well, it's biological. Don't buy that line. Men or women, don't buy that line. Why? Because fidelity is not about biology. It's about character. Now, even as I'm saying this, I'm aware that there are some among us who really feel about their sexuality that it is out of control. And you hate what you do. And you have lots of shame and you want to stop and you've promised several times to stop. And while I'm up here saying it's not a biological urge over which you have no control, it sure feels like a biological urge and you feel like you have no control. well here's what I'll concede and I just want to talk as gently as I can to you who struggle with this I believe it is out of control and you have lost at least right now what feels like your ability to choose and even say no and have this wall of fidelity around your marriage be rebuilt it's gone but what I want you to consider is this that maybe the reason your sexuality is out of control and the boundary of fidelity around your marriage has been destroyed is not just because of biology or raging hormones. More likely, it's this, some core beliefs that are built on lies. Lies like, and I can't go into all of them, I'm just giving you an example, lies like this, that sex has the power to turn a boy into a man. Sex has the power, and by the way, few of us would ever say this, we just act like this. Sex has the power to affirm my masculinity. And so all of a sudden, all the conquests are not at all about biology. What's driving them is that I feel like a real man when I can bed her and her and her. And what has the power to affirm my femininity and prove I'm really attractive is how many men are attracted to me. What's driving that has nothing to do with biology. It has to do with a lie. You believe that sex has the power to establish your identity. to establish your masculinity, your femininity. If you believe that, guess what you're going to need a lot of? You're going to need a lot of sex. And you know what? It has nothing to do with biology. If you believe that sex has the power to establish your masculinity or your femininity, you know what? After a while, it's not even going to matter much who you have the sex with. and after a while you're not even going to be able to stay inside boundaries that even you know are good boundaries and once again it won't have anything to do with biology though that's what you may claim because that's what the culture has reduced our sex to it's nothing but skin to skin, it's no big deal George Michael, the great prophet tells us sex is natural, sex is good, everybody does it not everybody does it but everybody should, thank you George guy's an idiot but he can play the guitar really good Marlena Dietrich had a daughter who recently was interviewed on the Today Show Marlena Dietrich as many of you know was kind of the Madonna of the 30s and 40s. She wrote a book about her mother, her daughter did, and in it she revealed that with all of her mother's sexual exploits, with both men and women, everybody thought she was sexually insatiable. But what she revealed about her mother was this. My mother hated sex. Well, the obvious question that the interviewer pounced on was this. Well, then why does she do it? I mean, she was a sex goddess. Her daughter's answer relative to her mother was this. My mother believed that if she didn't have sex, with everyone she could, everyone she knew would go away, and she didn't want to be alone. So here's the question. What drove her out of control sexuality? Biology? It had nothing to do with biology. In fact, I would guess that her biological drive for sexuality was normal, probably no more or less than yours or mine. It was within the realm of normal. And in the realm of normal, guess what? You can control it. what made her sexuality out of control was this. She was believing that sex had power that it didn't have. What she believed it had the power to produce and provide was things like her identity, her value, and her meaning. She believed it had power to make her lovable, special, desirable. But the problem was, as she was dipping into that source for her lovability need. What she didn't realize was that that's the equivalent of drinking salt water to quench your thirst. Tastes really good, maybe, on the front end, if you're dying to thirst, but I promise you, it's going to kill you in the end. Got to pull this together, wrap it up. We're out of time. Into all of this barrage of information and assaulting of lies that we believe, it occurs to me that some of you right now may just feel absolutely pinned to the wall. And because that's true, I need to preach as I close the gospel. It comes this way. In John chapter 4, Jesus met a woman at the well. And see, he knew something about her. What he knew about her was that she was thirsty. Nothing wrong with being thirsty, beloved. Every human being on the face of the earth has a thirst in their soul and it needs to be quenched. He also knew, however, this, that she was trying to quench that thirst of her life with something that could not quench it. What she was trying to quench it with was one sexual experience after another after another. And he said to her, I know about your situation. You've been married five times and the man you're with right now is not your husband. And what I know about you also is that even after trying to quench your thirst that way, you're still thirsty. one of the amazing things about this story in John 4 is this, that Jesus did not condemn her instead he invited her and what he invited her to was this young woman, I've got some water that will quench that thirst I've got some water that will nourish your soul come unto me all you who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest more than rest I will give you water more than water I will give you grace and that's good news to people who have crossed over the line you know what it means, you can come back and you can be restored and you can be cleansed and you can be remade but I'm telling you what you're going to have to drink from a different well this adultery well is again the salt water thing it tastes good on the front end At least it's wet, but it is full of deadly poison and very painful. Yesterday when we were coming out to the service in our prayer time before, one of the altar team, people were praying over this message and said, Lord, we pray that you would grant to your people who are in this more than remorse. In fact, remorse is nothing. But God, that you would call us and bring us to, as a gift from you, repentance. Because repentance turns from that well and goes to a different one. Come unto me, all you who are weary and heavy laden. I will give you rest. I will give you water. I will give you grace. That is true for you if you're in this right now. Point number four we will get to next time, where we will deal with the complexity of adultery. And the reason we're going to do that is because there is more than one reason people commit adultery. And there is more than one kind of adultery. I'd like you to stand as we close. I want you to know that as you leave this morning, the altar team will be here to pray for anybody who needs prayer for anything. Let's pray and be dismissed. Lord, I thank you for this word. I pray, Father, that it will land where it needs to land. I pray, Father, for those who are in the middle of this thing right now, that you will use this to push what is going on maybe now behind closed doors out into the open, where it will be very scary, but there can come your grace and your healing and real life again. I pray for those who may not be in this right now, but the thlipsis, as it were, The trouble that they're dealing with right now in their marriage is making them look for ways to get out. And I pray in your name that you would even use this word to yank our chain really hard. To keep us building up that wall of fidelity that protects our marriage where we can experience real sanctification and one flesh relationships with our husbands and our wives. I pray these things in Jesus name. Amen.
