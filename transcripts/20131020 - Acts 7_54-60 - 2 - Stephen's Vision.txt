Music Now when the council heard Stephen's words, they were cut to the quick, and they began gnashing their teeth at him. But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. And he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God. But they cried out with a loud voice and covered their ears and rushed at him with one impulse. When they had driven him out of the city, they began stoning him, and the witnesses laid aside their robes at the feet of a young man named Saul. They went on stoning Stephen as he called on the Lord and said, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. Then, falling on his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, Lord, do not hold this sin against them. Having said this, he fell asleep. this is the word of the Lord thanks be to God let's pray as we go to the word Father it occurs to me that as Stephen is looking intently into heaven he sees the glory of God and Jesus he sees them that at the beginning of his talk that is Stephen's he was speaking to his counsel about Abraham to whom the God of glory appeared. He appeared, did God, did you, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and then to Joseph and Moses and David and Solomon, and now Stephen, to appear now to us, I pray. Help us to see what can only be seen if you give us power by your spirit to see it. Pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. So there he stood, that is, Stephen, a man introduced to us last week as being full of faith in the Holy Spirit, full of grace and power. to having been falsely accused was Stephen in Acts chapter 6 by some men from what was called the synagogue of the freedmen, which secretly induced some people to lie about Stephen, to be false witnesses against Stephen, saying that he was constantly, incessantly actually, was the word blaspheming God, Moses, the temple, and the law, an accusation that in Stephen's day could cost him his life because the penalty for blaspheming God under Jewish law was death. So when the high priest stood up in Acts chapter 7 verse 1 and asked Stephen this question, are these things so? Have you been actually blaspheming God? Moses, the temple and the law, the stakes are high. This is life and death hanging in the balance. And while the answer could have been yes or no, I haven't been. Yes, I have been. Stephen instead launches into a defense that ultimately becomes the longest sermon in the entire book of Acts, 52 verses. We kind of dove into them last week from verse 2 to 53 of Acts chapter 7. It is his defense, a defense where he effectively and brilliantly, I think, turns the tables. They didn't see it coming, I'm sure, from being the accused. He's been accused of blasphemy, but in this talk, he turns it to, at the end of it, sounds like he is the accuser and they're the ones on trial, culminating his argument. And this is where it all came together, turning the tables in verse 51, where Stephen says, in effect, I'm talking about you, verse 51, because it's you men who are stiff-necked, uncircumcised of heart and ear, always resisting the Holy Spirit. Indeed, you're doing just exactly what your fathers did before you. And what their fathers did, you might remember, we talked about this last week, and this was according to Stephen, empowering him to make his point to them was this, that over and over again, their fathers, it's kind of our heritage, rejected the prophets that God would send. And God would send these prophets, these patriarchs, these deliverers of sorts to call his people, to actually creative people, to redeem and heal, to forgive and regather his people. But every time God would send a prophet, patriarch, deliverer type person in one way or another, Our fathers rejected him. We missed what God was doing, who God was sending. And that pattern has continued, says Stephen, in his talk right up until now when you did what your fathers have done by missing this time, this Jesus, who God sent as prophet, patriarch, I don't know, deliverer for sure. And when they heard this accusation, says verse 54, they were cut to the quick and began gnashing their teeth. And then they cried out with a loud voice and covered their ears. And they all rushed upon him, that is Stephen, with one impulse. And when they had driven him out of the city, they began stoning him. And they went on stoning him. And as he called upon the name of the Lord and said, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. Actually, in his death, he prayed two things. Receive me, forgive them. And having said this, verse 60 says, he fell asleep. Three things. As I look at this story, I find compelling here, worth examining here. hard to miss here actually is this intense hatred that I think is born of hell. I'm not just trying to make it big. I'll tell you in a minute why I think this hatred is actually born of hell. The second thing it's hard to miss in this story is right with this hatred born of hell comes this help born of heaven. And in the middle of that, there's this response on Stephen's part that is born of the Spirit, receive me, forgive them. Won't get to that one today, the hatred first. Let's look at that. Evidence graphically, very physically, I think, in the stoning itself. Verse 58 again, and when they had driven him out of the city, they began stoning him, and then they went on stoning him. Verse 59, some background here might help you understand why those words there are significant in what they were exactly doing. Because while the Roman method of execution, I think you all know, was crucifixion, stoning was decidedly Jewish. Clear parameters actually were established to make a stoning lawful, and stonings were lawful under certain circumstances. Luke 24, 14, for instance, says, whoever's going to be stoned needs to be stoned outside the city. Thus, they were driving him outside the city when they began stoning him. Among the offenses that could result in a stoning was blasphemy. A big surprise. Thus, the accusation of blasphemy that he blasphemes, that is, Stephen blasphemes God, Moses, the temple, and the law. Luke 24, 16 says no execution could take place without two or three witnesses. Witnesses who were provided, in verses 11 and 13 of chapter 6, as we've already said, by witnesses who were false witnesses put up by these people from the synagogue of the freedmen to lie about Stephen. To help prevent false witnesses, there was a law in Deuteronomy 17, 17 that says, a witness, if you're going to be a witness and this guy's guilty, the witness has to throw the first stone. And the thinking there was this would be a deterrent of some sort because if I know this guy is innocent and I have to throw a stone on him that kills him, what I'm doing will be murder. It was thought that that would be a deterrent. I'm sure in some cases it was, certainly not in this case, the Mishnah, actually, which is the first written redaction of the Jewish oral traditions, reveals specifically how a stoning was to be carried out. It's kind of fascinating, a bit gruesome, actually. It says this, the drop from the stoning place was twice the height of a man, so about 10 feet, twice the height of a man to the rocks below. One of the witnesses, so there'd be a witness reference here, pushed the condemned off the precipice from behind, causing him often to fall face forward on the rocks below. If he dies from that fall, that is sufficient. If not, he is turned over on his back or allowed to stand. The second witness then takes a large rock and drops it on his heart. If that causes death, it is sufficient. If not, he is stoned by all the congregation of Israel. So when it says in verse 58, see that thing kind of brings more meaning to this verse. When it says in verse 58 that they began stoning him, it wasn't sufficient. It didn't do the job. The first rock didn't kill him. And when it says that the witnesses in verse 58 laid aside their robes, remember that? Layed aside their robes and put them at the feet of Saul. They were doing that to become unencumbered. Okay, he's going to take some more. One rock didn't do it. So they could really let fly. They laid aside their robes. And when it says in verse 59 that they went on stoning him, fascinating. The linear tense there in the Greek indicates it was continuous action, which means they kept on throwing rocks. They pummeled him. They overdid it. It was overkill, all of which speaks to more than a judicial decision. It speaks to rage. It speaks to this hatred born of hell. But actually, the first place that you kind of pick up this hatred that's born of hell is in verse 54, where when they were cut to the quick, it says this, they began gnashing their teeth at him, which is a fascinating phrase, actually, because it's most commonly used, and this is where this hell connection, for me at least, came. This gnashing of teeth is most commonly used in Scripture when it's connected to some expression of or description of hell, because it's what happens in hell. Luke 13, Matthew 8, Matthew 13, Matthew 22, Matthew 24, All of them say the same thing, that in this place called hell, Gehenna, whatever, there shall be weeping and what? Gnashing of teeth. But the gnashing of teeth that is depicted here, being symbolically expressed here about hell, is not pain. I used to think that. They're in hell, they're gnashing their teeth because it hurts so much. The gnashing of teeth in hell is rage. so hell whatever else it is wherever else it is is going to be full of raging people angry people and they're angry about everything angry at god they're angry at life they're angry at you They're angry, angry people who in this life, fascinating, it's not all mysterious really, just kind of pay attention. These people full of anger in this life were, much like this council group, stiff of neck. They were hard of heart. They were hard of hearing. They were always resisting. And what's weird is the hell thing simply means they are going to be stiff-necked, hard-hearted, hard of hearing forever. Raging. And that's what hell is, which means, and I think you can connect the dots here. A lot of people don't have to wait to die to go to hell. They're in hell right now, and it's a hell that they've created. Heaven on earth. They've created hell on earth right here, right now. The big religious question a lot of people ask is this, heaven or hell, who's in, who's out? We evangelicals kind of have an answer for that. We think we know it's those who believe the right thing, and believing the right thing really does matter. It's those who pray the right prayer and praying a good prayer really does matter. It's those who have the right doctrine, and having the right doctrine really does matter. The problem is this, and the Pharisees, even in the story, these kinds of people kind of pose the problem, make us look at the problem, because there are people who kind of embody the right doctrine. They would be the Pharisees. There are people like that today. There are people like the Pharisees who do indeed pray the right prayer and study the right Bible, but who, like the Pharisees, when God shows up, they kind of miss it. When the Spirit of God moves, they can't see it. So another clue for who's in and who's out, along with believing the right thing and knowing the right thing and praying the right thing, all the important things, is pay, I don't know, attention. Because some people are, as I said, in hell right now. They're living now the way they will forever, stiff of neck, hard of heart, dull of hearing, always resisting. So there it is. Get a picture of it. It's what Stephen is facing and feeling. It's a hatred born of hell. And if it's too grandiose for you, I'm just kind of trying to let this be anything. And maybe things have come at you this way. Anything. He is facing something that he can do nothing about. He cannot stop it. He cannot avoid it. Whatever is coming. I was thinking about this this morning, it'd be like some system of evil is coming at you, and guess what? You're going down. There's nothing you can do to stop it. That's what Stephen's up against. There's nothing he can do to avoid what's going to land on him in just a few moments. But right in the middle of this hatred born of heaven, there comes this help born of heaven, because as Stephen is experiencing all this horror, he looks intently into heaven, verse 55, and God lets him see two things. And both of them dial into this. It's a very unusual experience here, but I wish I could have experienced this. Both of these things he sees are things that the church fathers have referred to for centuries as a dying grace for dying moments. And the first thing he saw as a dying grace in this dying moment was what Stephen called the glory of God. Verse 55. What is that? What is the glory of God? What does that look like? People sometimes ask me that. The truth is this. I don't know exactly what it looks like. When I try to imagine it, however, and I think it's good to try and imagine what the glory of God looks like, when I try to imagine, I often think of something that Jesus said in Matthew 16. Get the picture here. Jesus is trying to prepare his disciples for his coming suffering and death because he knows his coming suffering and death is going to be very disorienting to them. It's going to be very scary to them. They're going to be very confused about this because among other reasons, for among other reasons, you know, I kind of thought we were going to win, and you dying on a cross looks like we lose. So he's trying to encourage them relative to what they're going through for this season by telling them this, you just need to remember. You need to keep this eternity picture in your mind. What you need to remember relative to eternity is this, that my second coming is the first place, Matthew 16, that Jesus refers to this thing called the second coming, and he says, my second coming is going to be different than my first. In my first coming, the glory of God, that is mine, was veiled. In other words, it was hidden. The glory was there, but you just couldn't see it. Isaiah 53 put it this way, that he, that Jesus, Messiah, kind of speaking forward to this day when Messiah would come, grew up, says Isaiah 53, as a root out of parched land. He had no stately form or majesty that we should look upon him, no appearance that we should be attracted to him, which doesn't mean he was ugly. It means this, that there was nothing physical about Jesus or visual that we could see that would make us look at him and go, ah, God. There's nothing like that because the glory that was his was veiled. It was covered literally by his human flesh. And when he's hanging on a cross, the glory was never more hidden than then, veiled in flesh. The Godhead he. But now, Jesus says, there's something you need to know, and this needs to somehow get imprinted on your soul for eternal kind of hope, says Jesus. And what you need to know is this, that my second coming is going to be different than the first, because the veil of this flesh will in that day be removed. And I will come in the unveiled glory of my Father with his angels, Matthew 16, 27. Look at it on the screen. Jesus is speaking for the Son of Man He is speaking of Himself Is going to come in the glory The unveiled glory of the Father With His angels And on that day all the glory and power And honor and majesty that belongs to Christ Will be seen by men And on that day every knee will bow And every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord To the glory of the Father Matthew 24 verse 30 Describes it this way And these are all indescribable things, by the way, that human beings are trying to describe in ways that we could somehow get our head around. It says this, Matthew 24, verse 30, that the Son of Man will appear in the sky, coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. Revelation 6, 14 describes it this way, that the sky will be rolled up like a scroll. We sing a song with a verse like that in it. I see the sky being rolled up like a scroll. I see it like a window shade. You pull it down just a little bit. You let it go. And there's light. And there's everything outside that I couldn't see. Matthew 24, 29. Using the evocative apocalyptic language full of rich imagery says, the sun will be dark and the moon will give no light. The stars will fall from the sky, but it's weird. Well, that doesn't exactly say it's weird. It says, but all of those sources of light will be gone, but it won't be dark, because the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and it will be the unveiled glory of God that you see, and he will shine like the noonday sun, because he is the radiance of his glory. Hebrews 1 verse 3, the exact representation of his nature. And he will replace the sun and the moon and the stars because now the whole earth is filled with his glory. And it will be bright and it will be light because Jesus shines. When I was a kid, growing up in church, we talked a lot when I was a kid about the second coming. And what I remember about that, among other things, was this. I didn't want to miss it. That's why I accepted Jesus pretty much every day. But actually, it wasn't all that. I didn't want to miss it. I actually wanted to be here. I wanted to be alive when it happened. I actually remember looking out the window sometimes and seeing clouds that were particularly stormy and thinking, this is it! Mom, I think he's coming! Okay, shut up. Over time, I quit looking at clouds that way, and I quit expecting it every day. But I don't worry about it. Not even a little, actually, like missing it. Because if I die before that day, and you need to let this into your soul, Because if you die before that day, I won't, you won't miss a thing. Why? Because on that day, the day I die, the day you die, on our dying day, I will get, and so will you, a personal unveiling, face-to-face unveiling, and it will be the unveiled glory of God, and it will be bright, and it will be light, and it will be shining, and you won't wonder what you're looking at. And all of that, I don't know why, is what Stephen got a glimpse of in the moment of his death. It was a dying grace. In a dying moment, and I think people get those things more than we know. I'll never forget several years ago, Dallas Willard was here, and he was talking about that, and how historically we've had stories, and people have stories even in their families of grandma, grandpa, great-grandma, whatever, who in those final moments said something or saw something or said that they saw something, and you could tell the veil had been pulled away, and they were moving into someplace else, and it brought great hope to you, but it was kind of a mysterious lesson. Less of that lately, said Willard, and I don't know if this is exactly why, but he talked about how medically even we kind of are so worried about medicating people's pain, and I think that's a good thing that we have less of those kinds of reports, but it's not, these kinds of things are not unknown to people like you and like me and like Stephen. And then it says after he saw the glory of God, he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God, which for the council actually was the last straw. I mean, this really sent him over the edge that he's pretending, I think. You know, he's assuming that he is seeing somehow into the portals of heaven and he sees Jesus. Oh my goodness, this Galilean, this common, we crucified him. You're telling me he's at the right hand. This sent him over the edge. So they cried out with a loud voice at that point. Verse 57, and they covered their ears, which is a fascinating thing for the writer to include in this story because they were already dull of hearing, uncircumcised of heart and ear. So now when they covered their ears on top of it, it speaks metaphorically, symbolically, of someone who has gone beyond the capacity to hear anything at all of truth or reality. And then they rushed upon him with one impulse, and when they did that, Stephen's done because once they began stoning him they kept on stoning him but Stephen in the face of that hate born of hell got a gift born of heaven because I not only see, says Stephen, the glory of God but I see Jesus standing at the right hand of God, the significance of which is something we have talked about before here at Open Door, so many of you already know what this is. But the significance is this, that in most of the references in the scriptures, when they speak of Jesus being at the right hand of God, and there are several of those, in almost every instance, he is seated at the right hand of God, and that seated at the right hand of God thing is a picture of Jesus speaking theologically, and this is something that theologians refer to as his high priestly role, having replaced the priestcraft of the temple. It says in Hebrews 10, verse 10, while every priest stands daily ministering and offering in the temple, time after time, the same sacrifices which can never take away sin. That's the priest craft that used to be necessary. We've got a new high priest because he, that is Jesus, offered one sacrifice for sins for all time. And when he did that, he, what, sat down at the right hand of God, which means when it comes to our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins, that work of forgiveness, redemption, reconciliation to God is done. nothing more to do in his priestly function relative to that he's done, so he sits down. Symbolically speaking, of done. Works over. Time to rest. But when one of his saints, one of his servants, one of his little ones, like Stephen, I don't think of him as a little one, he's one of God's little ones, begins to suffer, is in trouble or in pain, and is afraid, particularly if one of his little ones is afraid of the dark, particularly if the dark that he's afraid of is death, which is precisely the dark that Stephen was entering. Then Jesus, who is seated at the right hand of God, stands up as if to say to people like Stephen, to people like you, to people like me, you have not been abandoned. You are not alone. I still know your name. And to do that, he stands, he leans in, he gets up, he's all in. Let me say it this way. Because the imagery here of Jesus standing at the right hand of God is designed, I believe, very intentionally to reveal something to us, to communicate something to us, and help us to see something that people of faith need to see. Desperately, I think, need to see and need to know. These images are often absent from our minds, indeed from our souls. We can't afford to have these images absent. So the intent of this image that Jesus, that Stephen sees and then describes to us is something that we need to know, and we need to know it particularly when we're facing this kind of dark nights where the pain really is unavoidable. The stones have already started hitting. I know where this is going, and the damage really is unfixable this time. The damage this time really is unrepairable. It is irredeemable, or so it seems irredeemable. Certainly in the moment it seems that way as the rocks are landing and they're finding their mark. My life is ending. My dreams are dying. in that moment, to Stephen, to you. One thing is clear about these people who are coming at him, their ears will never hear. They're done. They're done. They are covering their ears, so they will never hear. One thing is clear to Stephen, their hearts will never soften. Their necks will never loosen. They will never stop resisting God. How hopeless is that feeling? How final is that answer? But now back to the something that people of faith need to see and know. In light of those kinds of realities, it's this, that when Jesus stands up at the right hand of the Father, he does it for some very special, specific purposes and very special, specific moments. Indeed, they are intimate and holy, sacred moments because when Jesus stands up at the stoning of Stephen, he does it first of all to kind of say to Stephen, I will in this accompany you. He does it to accompany him. But when I tell you that, notice this hard reality. When Jesus stands up, when I kind of picture that symbolically, however that is, I see somebody stand up, he's finally going to get involved. But here's the scary part, the but it's real part. When he is standing up here now to get involved, his activity here is not to rescue Stephen. It's not to rescue him. It's not to deliver him, to heal him, because this time there is no escape. This time there is no last-minute reprieve, no God-will-save-the-day kind of song being sung, because this time when Jesus stands up in Acts 7 at the stoning of Stephen, It's as if he's saying, Stephen, you're going down, but you have not been abandoned. You are not alone. I still know your name, and I will accompany you. I will be with you. And to do that, he stands, leans in, gets up. He's all in, so he's standing in this dark day to accompany Stephen. But there's another thing he's doing here. He's not only accompanying him, he's interceding. Add this, add this. He's interceding, he's anointing, he's empowering Stephen to go through this dark day. 1 Peter 4, 14 says a fascinating thing. And something, just think about this and wonder about this. In your dark day or days, it talks about a spirit of glory that rests upon the saints of God in moments of crisis, particularly moments of death, and it's a grace for the moment. It's a grace in the moment, and it's a grace you can't prepare for. It's a grace you don't deserve. It's a grace you didn't get ready for. I think most of us are aware that these dark day experiences that I'm describing to you are real. and most of us when we think about them and feel empathy for people who are going through those kinds of things even in the world right now feel empathy but there's a kind of fear the kind of fear that stirs in us as we really hope we don't ever have to go through that kind of thing and added to that is this other sense that if we did get faced with that kind of darkness we wouldn't do well. We'd want to be heroic, but we wouldn't be heroic. I could never handle that. I could never go through that, not through that. Well, I would just suggest you think about something you don't know about, because you might be surprised. Because in ways you don't know, these images need to be branded, tattooed on our soul. In ways you don't know, until that moment happens, you need to know that when you go into those dark places, Jesus, this is what he does, stands up. He stands up at the right hand of the Father as if to say, listen, I know you didn't prepare for this. You can prepare for this, but in this, I will accompany you. I will be with you. I will intercede for you, anoint you, and empower you all the way through. And Stephen, being full of the Spirit, got to see it, but when he saw it, he gave us gifts. because he said it. And because he said it, we get to see it too. Indeed, that's the entire point of this vision being recorded. Last thing about this, Jesus standing up is this, that Jesus, our great high priest, when he stands up at the right hand of the Father, it's not just to accompany us, to intercede, empower, anoint us, But he stands up, I love this, to receive us. I mean, if you think of eternity, it's like he's standing up. Okay, I'll get the door. You're coming home. I'm standing up to get the door. Stephen, I know this is hard and scary. People shouldn't have to face a hatred born of hell. I didn't make you for this, but don't worry. Because when you die, I will stand up and meet you at the door. Some people's image of heaven, in fact, a lot of people don't have a healthy image of heaven. I think that's not a good thing. I think as believers we need some ideas, and that's what this whole thing is about. A lot of people have this idea, well, when I die, I'll go to heaven, and the gates, the early gates, we go there. And say Peter is there to determine whether we're in or whether we're out. Peter and I put together art. Anyway, but Peter, you know, this little thing, you know the deal, he administers some test to somehow weigh you, the good and the bad, and you hope the good outweighs the bad, and I'm pretty sure you know that's not the picture because when it comes to our redemption, to the forgiveness of our sin, our reconciliation with God, Jesus, having offered one sacrifice for all time, sat down at the right hand of God, so that whole thing is done. no more to do so Peter you can sit down too because the truth is this and we need to know this have it branded on our soul have an image of this in our soul that when we die first thing we'll see first thing we'll see is what Stephen saw we will see the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father because he's standing to meet you at the door and you'll be home 15 years ago my dad died um some of you were around when that happened I talked about that a lot and when he died I got scared I'll not forget it was this I don't know day or so after the event you're exhausted and a little disturbed by all of these things and I walked out into our driveway in the middle of the night I couldn't sleep and I looked up into the sky, and it was dark. There were stars, and I had the oddest thoughts as I looked into the vastness of this dark night sky. Is my dad lost up there? He was always bad at directions. And I don't think about this every day, but when I do, It's good, because here's what I believe, and here's what I know, and here's what Stephen saw. When my dad died, I don't know what else happened, but I know this happened. Jesus stood up and met him at the door. So here's the truth. We need to know on that dark day when your dad dies, or mom or sister, brother to Jesus, whatever else happens on that day, Jesus stood up and met him, met her at the door. So pick a name. I know this is kind of oh really yeah pick a friend someone you love maybe a parent maybe for some of you it would be a child on that dark day you need to know whatever else happened on that dark day inside of you relative to what Stephen was experiencing as stones were hitting him awful things on that dark day Jesus stood up and met him, her at the door and said, you're home. And then having said this, it says of Stephen that he fell asleep. End of verse 60. He fell asleep. See, see, that sounds weird to me. In the context of this violence, I take a nap. You know, I mean, if I was getting hit with rocks, it would be hard to sleep. Okay. Sorry. Obviously, this falling asleep thing means that he died. It's just kind of a nice way to say he died, a euphemistic way to say he died, he fell asleep. But here's the deal about this. The writers of Scripture don't write things this way kind of to be euphemistic. They don't do it to be nice. This is very intentional, the way Luke said it here. Because think about this falling asleep. In the context of this violence, when you fall asleep, what do you do? I didn't ask that right. When you fall asleep, what do you expect to do eventually? Well, I think, I expect, when I go to sleep, I expect to wake up. And that's the point. That's why he said he fell asleep to kind of in a subliminal way say this, that when he fell asleep, you need to know that Stephen did what you do when you fall asleep because Stephen woke up alive. He was alive, forever alive. And keep with the scene here, Stephen's body is dead, but he's now alive. Guess who's dead in this scene? though physically alive, those carrying the stones whose ears are hard of hearing, whose heart is hard, whose necks are stiff, spiritually dead, such a weird turn of events. So maybe my dad was wrong. About what? Well, my dad used to tell me when we talk about preaching, he used to say this all the to me. He said, Dave. In fact, he said this to me when I came and candidated here at Open Door years ago. I didn't know what to preach because, you know, I didn't think anybody picked me. I was one of three candidates. So I'll never see these people again, which I talk about. And my dad said, pick a text. It doesn't matter. It's the Bible. It'll be good. And then, yeah, I know. And then, I know. And then he said, Dave, well, here's, I don't care what you preach. Here's how you preach. You need to preach every time you preach. You need to preach as if you were a dying man speaking to dying men with some sense of urgency that something of eternity might be hanging in the balance. So maybe my dad was wrong when he said this is a sermon of a dying man to dying men, because Stephen was never more alive than he was right here. And that kind of life available to ordinary people like you and me is the gospel that we preach. one more noticing actually 8 verse 1 look at it on the screen says this guy named Saul I've been watching all of this and was in hearty agreement was in strong agreement with this stoning of Stephen which means that like all the others in this scene who were throwing these rocks Saul was himself stiff necked uncircumcised of heart and ears always resisting the Holy Spirit and indeed when it says in verse 3 of Acts 8 that he went on, it says that he went on a rampage, did Saul, ravaging the church. We'll get into that in the next few weeks. Going from house to house was Saul, dragging men and women out of their houses and throwing them in prison, which obviously means if I was Stephen assessing the condition of Saul's soul on that day, his ears will never hear. His heart will never soften. His neck will never loosen. Irredeemable. Unrepairable. Indeed, this guy will never stop resisting the Holy Spirit. I can tell. Until one day he did. And Saul became Paul. Which means, among other things, this, that Stephen was right. we talked about this last week because when he looked intently into heaven he said the heavens are open and they're open even for you who are throwing these rocks even for you Saul I know you need to know the heavens are open and they're open for you right here right now and so we pray Holy Spirit come and help us see what we can't see would you stand with me as a closing prayer Father take these images that you allowed Stephen to see and help us see them and may they be branded on our souls give us images on our souls eternity written in our hearts so that we would be able to live in this part of the story with great hope and deep faith and confidence in you. We're grateful for your life in us and the eternality of that life. And all God's people said, amen. Amen.
