Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. The Apostle Paul, being an apostle to all the churches, held more than one church in his heart at a time. He loved and cared for the church in Ephesus, but also the church in Colossae and Corinth and Philippi, and often in writing to one church would bring greetings from another church. It's in that spirit that I bring greetings this morning from the church in Belfast, Northern Ireland, from the Newton Breida Baptist Church in particular, from Raymond and Helen, from David and Glenn and William and Sam and Lester and Bill, and a slew of young people were flocking to this church in Belfast with a deep desire to enter into and experience life in the kingdom of God. If you were here the last couple of weeks, you knew that I was not here. You probably didn't know where I was. But it was my privilege, along with my wife Bonnie, to, for the last two weeks, rekindle the relational and ministry connection that began several years ago with these people, with this church that's extended beyond that church even now, when someone a few years ago somehow got a hold of some tapes in Belfast and began to spread them, and this relationship was connected. This is our fourth time to be with them. The ministry there that we had, being in the church two weekends in a row, and a pastor's conference kind of in the middle of all of that was fruitful and rewarding. Northern Ireland is not a large country, and the tradition is steeped in religion and even some spiritual life, but there's lots of beautiful, historic, empty and dead churches there. And the little spots of life are very vibrant. And this church is one of them. Captivated by the message of amazing grace and what it means to live right here and right now in the kingdom of God. What's interesting struck Bonnie and I both that in ways I don't think they even know. They're in a place partly because of the blight of life, because of their vibrant life, they have potential to literally affect a nation. It was their desire to convey to you their gratitude and their sense of kinship with us and what God is doing here and what God is doing there. It really is a God thing and it is a good thing. Amen. The Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 11.23 indicates, interestingly, I mean, why he gives this little piece of information is interesting, that it was on the night in which he was betrayed, that he took the bread and he broke it, that he took the cup and he drank it, saying, this is my body and this is my blood and this is for you. And he did that on the night in which he was betrayed by Judas, denied by Peter, abandoned by them all. Not very good friends were they. Particularly when the chips were down, they all left him and fled, it says in Matthew 26, 56. If you've been with us over the last few weeks, you've been aware that for the last few weeks we've been examining the teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, where he's talking to his young disciples in Matthew 5.31 about how the sons of David, men, had been treating in Jesus' day the daughters of Eve, women, with anger, contempt, and lust, and then having used them as you would use some thing, they were discarding their wives for any cause at all. Not very good friends were these husbands toward their wives. Particularly when the chips were down, they tended to withdraw from them, to force their will on them, to close up to each other, to consume each other. So that now, even today, as we fast forward to our day, the pain and the hurt of all of that between the sons of Adam and the daughters of Eve can at sometimes feel irreparable, beyond redeeming. Not very good friends sometimes are we, particularly when the chips are down. Divorce rates, as you know, are higher than ever before. Even among evangelical Christians, the statistics are discouraging that the divorce rate is higher among people like you and me than even the culture at large. turns out we're not very good friends. But from the beginning, it was not this way. We've been hearing for the last three weeks from Steve and from me and particularly from Jesus who says that in Matthew 19, verse 8, for God's desire and design from the beginning was Azar Konegdo. Remember that? Azar Konegdo, which Steve Weins unpacked for us a couple of weeks ago when he exegeted Genesis 1 and two, and I just got to tell you, I thought he did a brilliant, some of the best exegesis teaching I've heard on this subject from Genesis 1 and 2 and also Ephesians 5, azar kinegdo, face to face eye to eye, in it together as one flesh union, co-reigning and co-ruling on the earth with God not this relentless vying for power that we've almost grown used to as a matter of course in our relationships but submitting one to another and out of reverence for Christ wives to their husbands and husbands to their wives was God's design to be a people getting underneath one another to lift one another. But you know the story. You know that sin and selfishness came in and we quit playing fair and we learned how we could hurt each other so as to get the upper hand so as to have the power and to win. not very good friends are we particularly when the chips are down indeed we have betrayed denied and abandoned one another and what Steve described last week as a car wreck that began in the garden but that every generation since has piled into thus adding to and compounding the pain and the hurts the sense of betrayal and denial and abandonment but if you think a little bit further you begin to realize that it's not just husbands and wives and it's not just men and women it's us, it's all of us discarding one another even in our friendships for pretty much any cause at all not very good friends particularly when the chips are down I recently had an email interchange with a friend of mine and actually it happened in Ireland and weren't able to make phone contact and it was every three days or so I was able to get to a computer and and we were talking in in this thing about some issues of life between us that were really quite serious but each one of the emails grew a little more caustic and a little more sarcastic, which I'm sure is a big surprise to you that I would ever be sarcastic, and a little more angry. Everyone got a little more angry, and both of us are pretty good with words and know exactly where to aim those words, and some of the emails were long, but the final emails were actually quite short. Two words, see ya, followed by one word. Okay. I don't know if you've ever been in one of those cycles where the anger goes up and you start saying things. But when you're in one of those incessant cycles of hurt, you begin to wonder. Even while you're writing and even while you're reacting, you begin to wonder somewhere there's this voice. At least I get this. How do I stop this thing? How do I stop this thing? Because when you say a mean thing, they see you're mean and raise you one. And I'm not saying sorry. And you begin to realize, even as you're involved in it, that for this to stop, someone has to stop. But for someone to stop, someone has to go first. And I'm not going first. You go first. I always go first. So nobody goes first. All of which is part of what makes the words about Jesus that I read at the beginning of this talk in 1 Corinthians 11 so extraordinary to me. Because it was on the night in which he was betrayed that he took the bread and broke it, that he took the cup and drank it, thus saying in effect, I'll go first. I'll go first. It's a common theme, this I'll go first thing. It's a consistent pattern central to the message and the mission of our Rabbi Jesus. Matthew 20, Luke 22, the disciples are arguing amongst themselves. It's a common story. I've heard it often, even in a series where, arguing amongst themselves about who would be the greatest among them. That was their chief concern. And if I were to take that argument and put it in the context of marriage that we've been talking about lately, it would be like husbands coming to Jesus, wanting to know if headship means they get to be the boss. Tell her, Jesus. To which Jesus says, in effect, in Matthew 20, 25, you guys just don't get it. You don't get it at all. The very fact that you're asking the question tells me you don't get it at all. because while it works that way in the world, the rulers, that the rulers of the Gentiles lorded over them and their great men exercise authority over them, it is not to be so among you, for whoever wishes to be great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first shall be the slave, but knowing that they wouldn't do it and they didn't get it. It's as if Jesus says, in effect, in the next verse, I'll go first. Because the Son of Man did not come to be served. Like most kings are served. But I came to serve and to show you how and to give my life a ransom for many. See, to break the cycle of sin and selfishness and anger and pain, someone's got to go first. So I'll go first. Says Jesus, that's why I came. Not just to do it for you or to talk about it, but to show you how. So you could become cycle breakers too. Which is the kingdom of God. Right here. Right now. John 13, same thing. Beginning in verse 1, it was just before the Passover feast, and Jesus knew that his time had come to face the cross, to leave this world and go to the Father. and he also knew that as the meal was being served, this is amazing, he also knew, it's the same story, that Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, was preparing to betray him. And he knew that Peter would deny him and he knew that all of them would leave him and flee. Not very good friends were they. That he got up from the meal, took off his outer garment, wrapped a towel around his waist and wash the disciples' feet as if to say, we just can't talk about this anymore. I need to show you this, that someone has to go first. So I'll go first. Remember Peter? In this very scene of foot washing, when Jesus came to him to wash his feet, he resisted. Remember that? Indeed, he refused. Never. John 13, 8. Never shall you wash my feet. We speculate as to why he resisted this washing, that maybe he didn't get it, he didn't understand what Jesus was doing, which would be kind of consistent for Peter. And Jesus himself seems to indicate in verse 7 that that was the case, saying that, Peter, you don't realize this now, but you will later. But maybe, and this is just my speculation as to what it had to feel like for Peter to watch Jesus, the King of glory, in his mind, take off his clothes and take this lowly place of servant. I wonder if there's something inside of him that did understand. At least in part at some instinctive level that did understand that if this really is Jesus' way, it would have to become his way. And I don't know if I want to go first the way Jesus goes first. Peter was used to being first in one of the passages in Matthew. He's introduced in a long line of disciples as the first. is the protos, and that's the first. That's the number one, the authority. And he was introduced as, and first, Peter. Protos, Peter. But that's not the kind of first that's being spoke. This is the first to serve. This is the first to forgive. This is the first to say, I'm sorry. But Jesus' way is the only way to break the cycle. Of sin and selfishness, of anger and pride and pain, of betrayal, denial, and abandonment, they all left him and fled. Not very good friends were they. Now, you know the rest of the story with Peter that eventually he did get it. And when he did, he said in effect to Jesus two things. Jesus, I will receive this washing. I will receive this grace. Indeed, when he began to dial in to what it meant, he said, and this is again characteristic of his big heartedness. Not just my feet, but my hands and my head. I need a bath in this cleansing work, this grace. I need a bath. But beyond receiving this, by saying yes to this, Peter was saying, I am willing to become this. Because a disciple is not above his master. And if you are servant, Jesus, I will be too. If you go first, I want to learn to be that way myself. So what about you? And what about me? At Message Team this week, we were reflecting together on these weeks we've spent talking about anger and contempt and lust and how the sons of Adam have treated the daughters of Eve and how the daughters of Eve have treated the sons of Adam with those very things, anger, contempt, and lust. And we talked about all the pain and all the hurt and all the anger that at times feels when you hear the stories beyond repair, at times feels beyond redeeming. So what do you do? Where do we start? Two things might help as we come to the table. Two things we need, number one, to receive. Like Peter received what is being offered at this table, to receive this washing, to come and receive this grace, but also come with this willingness to become, because it was on the night in which he was betrayed, that he took the bread and broke it, that he took the cup and drank it, as if to say, someone's got to go first, you guys. So I'll go first. But then he says, Lechacharai. Come, follow me. And make my way your way. Because that will change the world. Let's go to the table. Thank you.
