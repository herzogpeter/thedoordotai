As we approach verse 13 and it goes to verse 39, we see Jesus taking this entire issue of spiritual abuse or this issue of false spiritual leadership and he takes it a step further. He doesn't let it, but it's as if in verses 1 through 12, Jesus is saying, here are the marks of false spiritual leadership. Here's how you can spot false spiritual leadership. Here's what it looks like. Verse 13, 39, here's the impact of false spiritual leadership and the systems that are marked by false spiritual leadership and the kind of impact they have on people. Verses 1 through 12, I said this at the beginning, the context is important to see, at least it kind of fills out the picture. Verses 1 through 12, he is talking to the multitude and the disciples. The Pharisees are there listening, but he's not speaking to them. In a dramatic turn, in verse 13, it switches. The Pharisees and the multitudes are there listening, but he is speaking to the Pharisees. And he opens with these words, But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, the hypocrites. It is clear from the beginning that Jesus is not spending a lot of time trying to be diplomatic. And the reason I think Jesus does, verses 13 to 39, is to not allow the people listening, disciples and the multitude, and to not allow us, who are now executing this, to minimize the danger of the characteristics that he just described. Because the tendency would be to do just that. What Jesus is making clear, I believe, in these next few verses is this, that when you see the characteristics delineated in verses 1 through 12, understand this, that we are not talking about differences in ministry style. We are not talking about differences in ministry approach, direction, or personality. It's not like, hey, we're all doing the same thing differently, but we're all on the same team. Jesus, in verses 13 to 39, is not allowing for that when it comes to these characteristics. There are times that it's true. We need to understand we're on the same team. That's another message. However, having identified these characteristics, he's going to make sure that we don't draw that conclusion. Verses 1 through 13 through 39, he is saying we are not on the same team. Here's why. Because they shut off, you, he's speaking to them, shut off the kingdom of heaven from there. For you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering and going. This is an incredible verse. Let's break it down, please. The first phrase is that they shut off the kingdom. Literally, to shut off means to slam the door in the face, making entry impossible. The word kingdom is significant, and it's important for us to be able to visualize it. It means the reign of God, the rule of God, the sphere of God's influence. Put them together. What he's saying is I'm shutting the door in your face, making entry into an experience of the reign of God, the rule of God, impossible. It's important not only to understand what he's saying here, but what he's not saying. It kind of perked my interest when I discerned from this, that he is not saying that these Pharisees were shutting people out from their synagogue. They were welcome to the synagogue. He wasn't shutting them out from their temple, their church, their membership, their religion, even if we were to make it contemporary, being in some sense in a Christian context. What they are being shut off from when they enter into the experience that was the religious system in Jesus' day was this. Really experiencing the vibrant, alive, free joy that comes to men and women when God in a community of people is allowed to reign as God. And what you have shut off is not a religious experience, but a reign of God experience. Think about that. Play that out of your mind a little bit. The fact is this. Lots of people have experienced church. Lots of people have experienced the temple, as it were, in Jesus' day. Lots of people have experienced religion of some sort, and even Christianity in some form. Lots of people would call themselves Christians. But the word of Jesus is this. that came to you in the context of verses 1 through 12, false spiritual leadership, people were putting heavy loads on, and you were carrying them all the time, people whose entire preoccupation was how they looked to everybody, it may be that you have never experienced the reign of God. I'm not saying that you're not necessarily a Christian redeemed. I'm talking about your experience of God in a church, temple, or in the context of Christianity. It may be that you have never experienced the reign of God. You experienced false authority. heavy loads, external performance, religious pride. Next thing he says, for they do not enter in themselves. You do not enter in yourselves. Get this. He's saying this, I believe. When you see systems and people described in verses 1 through 12, they, number one, shut off the kingdom from you. Number two, they are not experiencing the kingdom themselves. In fact, it explains, this verse does, why it is these people force their authority, live a double life, tie heavy weights on, and the performance is out here. Do you know why their performance is out here? Because they have not entered in themselves. Do you know why they put heavy weights on you? Because they are carrying heavy weights themselves. Do you know why they are pushing their authority? Because they know they have no authority. You cannot give what you don't have. People who are not giving away the kingdom don't give away the kingdom, this verse says, because they don't have the kingdom to give away. People give away what it is they have. They have not entered in themselves. Now that's got to blow the circuits of anybody listening, and it's also got to blow the circuits of contemporary Christianity, where you've seen those characteristics. Because, my God, Dave, the people that you're talking about are the most spiritual people. The people Jesus is talking about are the quintessential definition of what it means to be a godly person, and Jesus here is saying they haven't even entered. If those characteristics, verses 1 through 12, mark that leader, the reason they do is because they haven't entered. Don't go looking for that, but don't wonder what you've got when you see it. See, that's the kind of stuff I would never say. Maybe the most troubling piece, however, of this entire verse is the last part. They shut up the kingdom. They haven't entered themselves. Here's the most troubling. Nor do they allow those who are entering to go in. The thing that caught me there was this. The people who are having this shut off from them are people who are trying to enter. And what immediately captured me was that this was in contrast to people who may be rebelliously rejecting God. The people who are being shut off are not people who are out on the streets going, I don't care at all about God. This is irrelevant and I don't care at all. The people who are being shut off are people who are seeking, looking, desiring, responding to a God-induced prompting. They're moving toward God. The picture I have in my mind's eye is one that just doesn't go away. I can kind of hold this up on the screen of my computer brain here instantaneously. It's a housewife, a maple girl, doing the dishes. The kids are gone. but the kids are growing, and I'm in the house I thought would fulfill my dreams, and my marriage is what it is, and it's not a disaster, but it's not a disaster, and I have all these things that I thought by this time of my life, it would fulfill me, and I'm not, and it's just not there, and you're doing the dishes there, it's a goofy illustration, but this light goes, and you have a memory of when you were a little kid, and you went to church, and your parents dropped off, and there wasn't a lot of that in the family, I just thought, ah, I wonder if it's time to try that God. It's not a rebellious person. It's not a health and wellness. This is just the next day. And all of a sudden, they start to think, well, where would I go to find God about this guy? And there's all these buildings all in their neighborhood looking for cross-examination. And just by having to cross out the world, they have an advertisement. What the advertisement is is the same, essentially, as God. We know about that. We know about that. come here. And in Jesus' day, it was the temple. And if there was ever a place where you ought to be able to go to have an encounter with God, it ought to be the what? The temple. I mean, it's a logical conclusion. Jesus' anger of being expressed in this verse is this. In their search for God, seeking, looking, desiring this maple grove housewife, if you will, that's your search for God. They went to church, they went to the temple, but when they went to the church and went to the temple, they ran into these guys who welcomed them, welcomed them into their church and into their synagoguedes and into their movement. But they stood at the doors of the kingdom and they shut off the experience of the kingdom and they were from them. Why? How, because they had a false basis of authority, a double life, a tight, heavy way, so the performance was an external thing and an internal reality, and they weren√≠t able to get away anything that was lost in the city of heaven. And these people were looking for the truth. The most graphic picture of this comes for me out of Matthew 21, verses 12 and following, where Jesus is doing something he's very well known for having done, and that is he's cleansing the temple. You know the story well, so I'm not going to reconstruct the whole thing for you, but it's the day before the events of Matthew 23 where we're focusing. And what I want you to do is picture a 2,000 years ago version of the housewife in Maple Grove. it's a family coming to the house of God it is the Passover and in this family's heart is a desire to meet with God believing that if there's any place that we can meet with God it would be in the temple and this year just by way of telling the story and establishing some sort of illustration here this year let's just decide that mom and dad decided it's time to bring the kids to the Passover we're going to bring the whole family and all the way to the temple They were talking to the kids about what they might expect when they go to the temple. And we're going to learn about God, and we're going to learn about forgiveness, and we're going to learn about mercy. And all year long, they've kind of been preparing their kids for this pilgrimage to the Passover, to the temple. And by the way, the events of Matthew 21 and 23 were right around the Passover. That's why the place was so packed with people in Jerusalem. And they knew enough about sacrifice that they needed to bring a sacrifice. And one of the things that was common, so this wouldn't be an incredible stretch to include this story, was that sometimes families, especially in poverty, would not have this incredible animal to offer, but they would sometimes bring the family pet, being a symbol of their love for God. The thing that cost me, David's spirit in giving, was I will not give to God that was costing nothing. And sometimes these kids are bringing this land that they raised, and they love this thing, but they want to tell God they love them the way they ought to tell him to love them, and we're going to do that. And so they're ready and their hearts are open. And when they approach Jerusalem, they're a little put off. It's really crowded and it's really scary. Just come on, we're going to get to the temple. And when we get to the temple, we're going to get what we want. We're going to meet with God. And we're going to have this neat experience. And when they get to the temple, there were two things that began. Let's just be the father or the mother, the parent. And you start beginning to worry a little bit, not just about the kids, but yourself. First of all, the kids. And one of them is just the temple itself. Because the temple itself is very structured. spoke some things to you that seemed different than what you were telling your kids you were going to be able to do before we told the kids we need what God will go to church. The very structured temple said this, we can't get together. And you may or may not know the structure of the temple, but the temple had an outer court, which was called the courtyard of the Gentiles. The courtyard of the Gentiles was so named because everybody could be in the courtyard of the Gentiles, including the Gentiles. You could have animals in the courtyard of the Gentiles. The world was there. in a picture. The world was in the courtyard of the Gentiles. After the courtyard of the Gentiles, there were six ascending inner courts. Inside the courtyard of the Gentiles was another court. Only Jews could go into that. Inside that, there was another one. Only men could go into that. Inside that, there was another one. Only priests could go into that. Inside, and finally, finally, it was eliminating people, eliminating people, eliminating people. So it came to a place called the Holy of Holies where only one person could go, and that's where God was, and the message was, I mean, you didn't have to be, you know, a Greek scholar, a Hebrew scholar, a religious scholar, to hear something in your spirit, you wouldn't even come up with words, I can't get to God, only one person a year can get to God, the very structured temple said that, but we're going to ignore that, we'll still have a neat experience, but there was something else when you got into the courtyard of the Gentiles that began to cause some fear, there was this thing going on in the courtyard of the Gentiles called the booth of approval and a confusion of booths, a marketing in the courtyard of the Gentiles. Everywhere you looked, there were booths set up. And in a metaphor, what these booths were offering was the right way to get to God. Implements of worship. If you buy this from us, you can get to God. I didn't even know what most things were for. They're just kind of confusing. I see those, and I'm just, all we want to do is bring our Let's bring this little lamb. Welcome to the front of the line. You start getting this thinking feeling because just about every lamb and every sacrifice that they bring up there is being rejected. And they get up there, and they're a little timid now, but they're still pretty confident that this is an act of love, and we love God, and we want to experience him. So they offer the little lamb, and they explain the story, and these are my kids, and we just want to tell God we love him, and the Pharisee, in one way or another. Let's say we get in nice. He says, oh, that's funny. But Harrison, this is not a spotless thing. Not the best thing. And so they take a little lamb, and they bring it behind the screen. And the scam, by the way, in the courtyard of the Gentiles, was that they would take those lambs that were not okay, not approved, and they would stick them over in one of those booths. And they would instruct, if you go to one of these booths over here, and you can buy from them the sacrifice that would be appropriate. So they go to one of these booths, and they say, well, our offering is lost from our heart, and they say we can buy from you. And what it ends up costing is 10 times what a lamb is up to you. It's costing you. And so you go to the booth. And then they start telling you all the other stuff you need to buy. You really want to get you. I don'T want to get you back the right way. It's not just the lamb. You need a lamb. You need a lamb. You need some water. You need some crazy. You need this and you get that. And they start to pay, and they start to pay, and they pay, and they pay, and they pay. And all I did, all that I wanted to do was meet with God, and they pay, and they pay. And the picture is this. They go to these little booths. And bythe way, I don't know if you get the picture, but I see these booths as a confusion of the booth. I see these booths as churches all over the place. And you know what? These booths have a purpose. I'm going to say, being there is not the problem. if what they're doing is making it easy to get to God, if they're teaching and expressing access to God, let them hear you. You come here, and we are going to make it easy for you to get. We're going to tell you the way. I'm going to tell you about amazing things. About when you got to this church, you paid, and you paid, and you paid, and you paid. And you went to this church, and you paid, and you paid, and you paid. And guess what? They never got to be done. They never left the church. And one day, Jesus walked into the church. I love you. I love you. Jesus sent to the temple. He cashed out all those who were buying himself. See, when I was a kid, I used to think he was sick. You know, what would be the 90s? You know, what would be the equivalent of that's the way? Selling tapes in the floor. He's ticked about that. And our big stand here, our big stand as a church. Oh, you won't ever do that. You need to have a money changer. No, we didn't get it at all. They were buying and selling in the temple. What they were doing was shutting off the team of some people in China. Just when they came to the temple looking for God, they ran into a scam. And a bunch of religious paraphernalia that was necessary. It wasn't about Jesus. It wasn't just about getting to God. And he overturned the tables and the money changed from the seats of those who were selling doves. And he said to them, it is written, my house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves, a robber's den. Contemporary vernacular, you have made it a place where people get ripped off. In the vernacular of our conference, you have made it a place where people get abused. This is the most incredible picture. Why? The impression of blind and lame people is they're going to try to get out of their way. What do you think? That violence would even scare them more than other people. Doesn't it amaze you a little bit? I can't paint the picture. I can't paint it accurately myself. It just amazes me that Jesus' violence to them seemed like a comforting thing. They went toward him. It didn't scare them. They knew he was fighting for them. He was cleaning out the cave. He was cleaning out the temple so that blind and lame people would no longer be. a distraction to the business of the temple, he was claiming out the temple so that blind and lame people would become the business of the temple. I mean, you're doing that, aren't you, with the church in your mind? And I expect the tables to leave you turned over from personal to technology. I mean, you've got your own list, how do you get your fabulous stuff? You get the way, get in the way of the real work of the kingdom so that we're not going to housework What I want to know is when they come into the heaven and come in with the living room. We don't do it right all the time. We don't do it right all the time. We're not talking about a perfect church. We're talking about a place. Stuff that smacks our agenda and our personal kingdom building has been removed so the Spirit of God can do what we do. I think that's what he meant when he said he set up the kingdom. He'd warn that these dynamics can rise up even in the context of a redeemed community. And I would say that it can happen this way. And at this level, I'm going to just clarify. Whenever and wherever the characteristics of which it once and as well exist, the reign of God will be set up to the people. I'm going to say it more clearly than that. This is more like a... To the degree, The degree to which the characteristics of verses 1 through 12 and 6, it is to that degree that the kingdom will be shown. And what that means, I'm not being very scientific here, and I don't have chapters to prove this. It's more of a, like, a gut level thing. I think there are degrees of this. You know, you've got this little verse of slip problem over here. So the degree that these characteristics are there in the direction of the kingdom, it says to that degree, the reign of God, the experience of people, the Spirit's name of God will be sent out. And I think that allows for the fact that some redeemed people who really are genuinely on the way to heaven could go through their entire life in a church in the court that they've been sent out and never experience so pending whatever it should be in the community where God is in the world. That's great. Next characteristic is they devour people in the book of 14. Next impact, rather. The devouring people. This issue of devouring we've seen before when I read Ezekiel 34, Zechariah 11, 16. It happens through what I referred to earlier in the first section as a role reversal. That is, instead of the shepherd being there for the sheep, the sheep are there for the shepherd. Instead of the shepherd using his or her authority, power, and strength to give, And that's why God has given authority, by the way. God has given authority, strength and power, to men and women in leadership, to use that, to give, protect, nurture the flock. Instead of using that for that, abusive system shepherds use their authority, power, and strength that they have to take, fleece, and devour the flock. You devour widows' houses, even while you give long prayers. Deuteronomy 34, again, What we have here is the verse that gave birth in my pilgrimage to the whole concept of spiritual abuse. It was at this verse that the word spiritual abuse kind of came into my vocabulary. This is a bit graphic and maybe even frightening. The best parallel I could think of to what I was discerning in that verse, this role reversal thing, instead of using my strength to lift you, I'm using my strength to take from you. The illustration that came to me and it horrified me when I first saw it was that this is like sexuality. This is like emotion. This is like abuse. to explain the dynamic of just abuse in general, which is where we're doing this abuse conference, and I haven't given this, especially as it relates to leadership. Sexual abuse, any abuse, is when person A, let's make it an emotional or a sexual abuse, let's say it's a parent, who was put in the life of that child, person B, for the purpose of protecting, nurturing, feeding, and meeting the needs of that child, begins to use the power that I have as a parent, I have power, I do, and use the position I have as power, and use my size, rather than to use that to get underneath my kids and lift them and nurture them and protect them, I use that very power God, in fact, gave me to take from them and use them. And literally, you've got a dynamic here, whether it be physical, emotional, or sexual, where I'm using the child to meet my needs. Emotional abuse would be maybe the most subtle of the three, meaning that I am vicariously kind of living my life through my child, and I'm using that child to build my weak self-esteem, and all of a sudden this child has to be the best child on the face of the earth, and they have to go through all the hoops, and it has nothing to do anymore with my really caring for them. It's my whole sense of values wrapped up in how this kid looks. I have a hard time putting abuse on that. It's role reversal. That child, all of a sudden, is there for me. Fiscal abuse is when I use my power not to lift, but to crush, to get my lift. Sexual abuse is the most obvious graphic, maybe horrifying of three, in terms of visual things and how they hit us viscerally. I don't know if it's necessarily the most damaging. It's certainly incredibly damaging, but it's when, instead of using my strength and size to get underneath those kids and protect them from these very tiny things, I use my strength and size to take them from these very tiny things. I will be protected. control of wisdom, that's what they say. Whether it's sexual, emotional, sexual, or spiritual, it's a biology. When it happens, and if it happens to you, among the things you felt, this is a confusion. If you're a little kid, I mean, I'm not going to flip it back and forth for you, but some of these scenarios are working for you as a kid, It's very confusing. It's very frightening. There's absolutely nowhere to go. You're absolutely helpless. You can't say no. Pastor, how do you say no? If it's a mom, there's a dad. You can't resist. It's daddies. It's pastors. Mom. They know that. They're 10 years old. They're here to protect me. It's probably someone who did. The Bible says that they are parents anymore. This is right. I've heard that. The Bible says, obey your readers. And you should. And you should obey your readers. Okay. The first thing we notice is that this verse kind of opened up to us in a way that we can put contemporary words on it. And we understand these other abuse contexts. And many of these things I got just in these long-term situations I reject. Thank you. The kind of abuse is different, but some of them are the same. But I think we know enough now to know about things like what? An incredible, almost, this is weird, almost a gift from God to help this little 10-year-old child survive with something that 10-year-old children shouldn't have to cope with, and they literally go into denial. They literally forget. And when they're 35, they maybe have a little bit more tools, because they'll get pulled back, and they have to start dealing with the poor. I'm saying one thing is that marks abuse victims of any kind of distance as long as they're not possible. Another is that in ways that might surprise you and me if you've never been a victim of abuse is that they blame themselves. Whether it's sexual, emotional, they don't see seasons, and maybe they never get over that completely where they blame themselves. Victims are spiritually. It's their thoughts. I will just obey the past. I really want to tell you that. It really was my fault. Lots of shame. Lots of fear. Another characteristic is that victims of abuse very often live in such a way where the perpetrator, whoever it was, grandma, grandpa, pastor, mom, whatever, the perpetrator still has power and control in their life long after the incident. And sometimes power and control in their life even after they're dead. I mean, you're kind of living your life wondering what they would pretend. There's just incredible power in their life. And among all the things that are painful and that clearly show up in any victim of abuse, It's very hard to trust. It didn't come in the context of love and nurture and adulthood and freely giving. And so this child in denial didn't deal with all that stuff. And don't expect them to. We're talking to him. Maybe they do. They get felicit. They get married. And maybe it doesn't show up until they start to deal with their sexual abuse issues. But this symptom might show up before they even deal with their issues that they know about. And that is, they're married, let's just say, the victim of a woman, and they're married to a husband. And let's just say the guy who loves her is not another abusive situation. He loves her and cares for her. And his response to her is a normal one. And he moves forward sexually, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's wonderful. It's normal. And there are reasons that she can't even understand. She can't respond. And has a very difficult time to respond. becomes a real significant point of tension in the marriage. And the truth is, it's a lot of her feelings. And while to him it feels like rejection and trying to love him, and I don't understand that this is a normal thing, and she does love him, but she can't. She can't give herself to this because there's no context in which she's ever understood sex. She's never had a context in her sex before they're given to herself. And every time, even when somebody in the healthy way comes towards her, It feels like a taking thing. He doesn't do it. I can't read it in any way. We're talking about reading. Okay, that's pretty drastic. In a spiritual way, it happens to be saying, now I'm reading this thing to learn from the past. We have spiritual victims in our church. I think the church is leadership. I'm a leader. Anybody who knows me, maybe you can pick it up just in talking. I'm not real passive about the things I believe. I say I'm a leader. I feel gentle and all that kind of stuff, but my leadership is like that, and I respond. And let's just say, in the spiritual arena, I'm the husband who is doing what a normal husband would do. I'm the husband who's doing. He's starting to meet him in his life. There's nothing wrong with it. That's it. Now, we're not talking about abuse and obviously. That would be a different thing. But let's just say, pretend it's all healthy, normal, godly, right. And there is this group of people, many of them, who, who can't do this. And you know why? Because they've never seen leadership in the context of giving the power to the people who are taking. And they are incapable of responding to leadership. One of the marks, one of the marks that the Spirit has reduced them is that they have a really hard time to stop the people. What I need to know as a pastor, I mean, I don't know what size of a church you want to pretend we have here, but we have a fairly large church. And part of my job is to simply, among others, understand to give people room to not come along. It's not possible. That it's okay. You don t have to do it. It's okay for you to not say you should go along. But, you know, what do you mean is that you will be able to do it. It's even if you're not comfortable you want to do it. I'm not always sure how to do that. What, the lens I needed to ask them is to understand that even though I might get vilified. See, this is the weird thing. We're kind of putting this in both the other industry. People who have been abused can respond to leadership, even healthy leadership in the most way. One of the things that leadership has to do, and I don't like it, it's like an apparent thing. Some has got to be apparent. Some has got to be developed. Part of what we have to understand is that sometimes what is going on, I think it's going to be easy. But it sure helps me be a lot more gentle. I want to know that. It costs me a lot more than something. And I don't know what you remember. But it's a fact. So I think you got the picture. The picture here is a little verse. Instead of me being there to get underneath you and use the gift of God's leadership, using the gift of God's authority, you don't need to lift them and empower them and send them out. They use their authority to take and draw it onto themselves. And it empowers people, and the people are confused. I guess they should obey. The pastor would say, fine. Now add this middle of the verse to the whole thing. While they're being devoured, they're offering long prayers. Even while they're offering long prayers. I don't know if I can recreate in words how scary they are, but that's very scary. The whole time they're devouring people, they look scary. Yeah, they're offering long prayers. So they look the most scary. They look the most scary. How do you think that? I mean, it goes back to the kids, 10 years old. Out of the 10-year-old kids, there's an inequity in the authority and the power of God. I hope you're kidding. There's nothing wrong with the Lord. There's nothing wrong with the Lord. Here from God is it. But these dynamics are not understood. And for very, very powerful. Pull it all together. I hear Jesus saying this. When you see the characteristics of verses 1 through 12, false basis of authority, heavy loads, low reversal of people who wear their religion, but it's not on the inside. Do not be deceived. It is not a benign thing. It shuts off the kingdom for people who are trying to enter into the power of people. A third characteristic or a third impact is this. They reproduce. Isn't that good? They reproduce. They reproduce. Verse 15 says this. What do you strive to perish as hypocrites because you travel about on sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he becomes one, You're making Christ as much a son of hell yourself. I just wish Jesus would say it straight. You know, just come out and say, wait, thanks, and put beating around the bush. Kind of in a more contemporary vernacular, what I hear this verse saying is this. They pass their disease along to their victims. Only when they pass their disease on to their victims, the next generation's disease is worse than the prior. Keep it a little more, even more contemporary, And as a dysfunction and distorted spirituality is passed on from generation to generation, it gets worse, it gets cemented, and you kick that down the line for 20 years, 30, 40, 50, 100, you kick that down the line long enough, and it looks normal. And all of a sudden, this is what God is. This is what church is. This is normal. Let's look at this text a little closer, break it down. The first thing you notice about this reproduction is that it's purposeful. They travel about on sea and land to make one cross a life. They are zealous for what they probably would call evangelism. These people who are doing this would maybe have as their first going into all the world in free's gospel. Evangelism, please hear this. You know this, and you say, I think you know I know this and believe this. Evangelism is certainly a vital thing. It is a biblical mandate, no doubt about it. But what these guys are doing is not a vital thing. Why? How do you know that? Well, I know it right out of the text. Because Jesus said their form of evangelism, whatever it is, I'm not picking on anybody in particular, I'm just doing the first right now. Whatever their form of evangelism is, is not producing sons of God, producing sons of hell. So, not a good thing. Question. Why is their proselytizing, going about on sea and land, being very aggressive, purposeful, about bringing people in? Why is it producing that sons of God but sons of hell? Two reasons at least. That, by the way, we know. And these are all drawn out of the text from what we've already known. Number one, because of their message. Well, how do you know their message? We already know that because Jesus gave the characteristics in verses 1 through 12. Their message is not a message of brokenness, mourning, hungering after righteousness that only God can give. Their message is not what of grace, faith, and our only hope is Jesus. Their message is putting that weight on more and more. Try harder, do more, carry the load, it's up to you, and whatever you do, look good. Broaden your flag trees, a little bit broader. Their message does not point to grace and faith, but it points to law and striving. It does not produce brokenness and mourning. Their message produces self-righteousness and pride. And the text says, that produces sons of hell who think they're on their way to heaven. Very, very much. That dynamic produces sons and daughters of hell who think they're on their way to heaven. One reason they produce sons of hell twice as much as themselves is because of their message, and others because of their motives. Ask yourself this question. We don't speculate a little bit around this. But why do you think this is so so? These people, we know who they are. They're described in verse 1-12. We don't have to speculate about that. Why would they be zealous to hold people in love, compassion? That was described in verse 1-12. Would it be that they saw the people who were in bondage, that they saw the distressed and downcast like sheep without a shepherd and lawns of lift or load? We already know that's not true because we know verses 1-12. These people were not looking for people who were weighed down so they could lift their load. They were looking for people, based on verses 1-12, who would accept the load they wanted to give. They were looking for people who would carry the same load that they were going to carry. Gary, hear this. The form of evangelism that we see or hear Jesus speak of in verse 15 is not evangelizing. I shouldn't even use that word. It's not evangelizing. It's recruiting. It's not liberating the lost. It's validating me. See, if I can proselytize you and get you in, the reason I'm doing this, if this proselytizing is coming out of verses 1-12, is because it makes me feel like I'm doing what I ought to do. It has nothing to do with my care for you. These are not people who lift up the weight off people. They lay heavy, heavy loads on people laying on their shoulders. There's nothing more to take off. I was fresh in a couple of colleges. It was a Sunday afternoon. I was in the dorm room with a few of my friends watching a Viking film. A group of people came into a room that I had never seen before. They identified themselves as students from a school here in town. And soon what dawned on me, I was going to say, I was going to get here. I was going to go to that school. What dawned on me was they were here to witness to us. And that was okay. That was okay. I mean, I was a little nervous and a little wondering what they were doing. Plus, you know, I was one more today. And so I just assured them that I love the Lord with all my heart, that I wasn't being, you know, like my name is Jesus. And I was making sure that they didn't buy that. It was clear, and they even told me why. Two reasons that they weren't convinced that I was saved. Number one, I went to Bethel. That's a true thing. That's absolutely true. And number two, this wasn't said. It wasn't implied. I wasn't doing what they were doing. I mean, I was watching a Viking game. They were out doing what real Christians do. On a Sunday afternoon, they don't want to fight these things. They go and visit people at other schools and win them the price. At that point, when they told me that they didn't believe I was saved, I said something that convinced them that they were right about my career status. They were afraid. And they left. When they left, I'll never forget how I felt. I felt angry. I felt defensive. I felt intimidating. I felt deceiving. I knew the message of the gospel. I was close to 20 years old. I had launched a major change in my life, about 18. And Jesus was real to me. I was not going to mess with him. Well, I was going to be strong. But I loved Jesus. I loved the Lord with all my heart. And I understood grace. And it was amazing with all of the understanding and even life experience I'd already had with grace. How intimidated I was in that 10-minute conversation. and how many fibers of my body wanted to run out the door, down the stairs, out the door, and try to find out what I needed to do to convince them that I really was redeemed so they'd be okay with me. Convince that I was redeemed, my redeemed. Ultimately, that experience was a good one for me because it forced me to decide some things. Where was I? And I didn't talk like this then, but I did this then. I came up with words later to explain what I did then, but my decision was this. Where am I going to look right now to be okay? Am I going to go back to the cross and decide that my value in my life comes from what he did, or am I going to get it from their opinion? If you're going to get it from their opinion, run downstairs and do everything you want you to do. If your sense of okayness is going to come from them, then go and get them and do everything you want. And I chose you. Probably because I didn't like it. It wasn't all that spiritual. Here's my question after that whole story is this. Why did they come in my room? Love? Were they out there designing to lift the load of my shame and guilt as much as God's healing and love? Maybe. I don't believe Verse 15 is speaking of a group of people who are not attempting, because of flaming hearts for God and compassion for people, to convert people to God. They are trying to convert people to their system. And in converting them to their system and using God's words and all sorts of God names on it, they're attracting people, but in converting them to their system, they're making them twice as much a son of hell as themselves. It has nothing to do with God. Let me explain this to the Pharisees. according to Lenski, was one of the commentaries I used when I was going through this, identified historically two kinds of Pharisees. Or, not two kinds of Pharisees, but a Pharisee's perspective of two kinds of converts. That's what I was going to say. A Pharisee had a view of two kinds of converts. One was a proselyte of the gate. A proselyte of the gate was a Gentile who, when they heard of the true God and the necessity to have faith in him, believed. Acts 16.14, Acts 18.17 would speak of someone like this. And Acts 16 and Acts 18 identifies them as true worshippers, what we might refer to as a simple believer. They don't know all the stuff, they don't know all the church, Baptist Alliance, Catholic. That to a Pharisee was a proselyte at the gate. To a Pharisee, this person was in, but not very impressive. They had another term for the ones that were the elite. They were the proselytes of righteousness. The proselyte of righteousness beyond the proselyte at the gate was the person who converted to the system that is, they bought the bad. They got circumcised, they led the rituals, they followed the rules, they embraced the Levitical tradition and the system. And before you knew it, this particular convert was preoccupied with and knew far more about things like circumcision, rituals, rules, Levitical traditions and systems than they knew about God. In other words, they were learning far more about how to be a good Pharisee than they were learning how to be honest to goodness men and women of God. being a good Pharisee, that's what matters. Learning how to be a man or woman of God, this was where our preoccupation was. They were learning how to be followers of God. They were learning how to be Pharisees. They weren't learning how to be followers of Jesus. They were learning how to be Baptists. They were learning how to be followers of Jesus. They were learning how to be Lutherans, Catholics, Christian Mission Alliance. I'm not saying that in my church, when I came here 15 years ago, that these people weren't believers. But I do remember a dynamic in our church that we had elders. It blew me away, and it took a while to change this. But we had elders who were far more familiar with our church constitution and bylaws than they were with the Word of God. I mean, they knew bylaws, chapter and verse, and every time you violated a bylaw, it was like in your face. But when you brought the Word of God, they didn't get that. Why? And this is not, these weren't bad people. It was a system thing. And before you know it, it became more important to be a lion than it became to be, and nobody knew the difference. These weren't bad people. This was not a huge, abusive church. No, thank you. You know, this was not where all this false, evil doctrine was. The point of that is this can happen anyway. That's why you call it the sun. I don't know if you ever see that. where people get converted not to God but to a system. And I think, see, I think there's this mix, and then it just gets very confusing, and I don't know the mix, and I'm glad it's not my job to figure it out. We just need to say it out loud and try to help sort things out. But I think there are a lot of absolutely, you know, completely, I mean, there are indeed people who, coming into faith, got into a system where the system mattered more than just genuine love for God. And they bought the bag and the joy is gone. They really love God. They really do. They are redeemed. But that's never been famed. That was not the priority. Twenty years later, they're really good Baptists. They're really good Lutherans. And they're really good Catholics and Christian-Christian Alliance. But the flame has been extinguished. And the Pharisee, the one who converts the system, is the true covenant. This text says, no, you don't get it, Pharisees. They're not a child of God, they're so in hell. I'll tell you, I can't, I don't know. Can you imagine Jesus showing up today in our churches? I think he controlled grace. I think he controlled grace. I think he did very good. I think he did. I think he did a lot of love. I think people are really loving, work hard, and assist and stuff. I think it's wrong. I think it's wrong. But I do think also that some people who sing the name of Jesus and say the name of the man of the only one who's there at night, they began to say knowledge and then they hate Jesus just as much as the person who's there. And there are people who would say the name of Jesus and they don't put them. They drive around. That's the end of the Matthew. I'm not going to get to some time, but it's the end of Matthew. One of the final marks that Jesus gives of a false Christian leader is that you love the prophets of the past, but you show the prophets of the present. Did you get that dynamic? That's why I just mentioned that Jesus showed up today. He dared to preach to them. And a mark of a false system is that they have the picture of their founder on the wall. And they have pictures of Jesus everywhere. Oh, where are the Jeremiah's? Oh, where are the John the Baptist's? Where are the greats? And they're here, folks. God has prophets in every generation. And when they show up, they kill them. They drive them out and they do some jobs. I have a question about that. When this thing is happening, how do you break that cycle? How do you break that cycle? Can it be broken? I think the answer is yes. But just like in the case of a sexual abuse cycle in a home, in order to break a spiritual abuse cycle in a church, number one, it needs to be seen. I mean, somewhere along the line, in the church, there needs to be people who understand the issue and see the issue. To do that, I think you need to hear the truth. Number two, it needs to be said. You need to see it. You need to say it. To use Jeff Van Bounder's terminology, you need to break silence. And you need to know this, that if you see it and if you say it, when you say it, you will be so appreciative. they will probably have a banquet in your honor saying, oh, oh, thank God, thank you for turning on the light of this issue. You know, you all laugh, that's why you know it. In fact, everyone I've ever known who's ever used of God in their circle to break the cycle in their family or in their church of sexual or physical or spiritual abuse, everyone I've ever known who's been used by God in New York. You know, that's not good news. That's not good news. I have some courage in this. The courage in Jesus' lives. That's exactly what Jesus is doing today. What God is raising you up to do, maybe some of you in your families and in your churches, you feel like a woman. I can tell you this, you feel like a woman. It's not going to make the pain go away. Know this. Jesus did it. Matthew 23. Jesus is standing in the courtyard of the Gentiles and he is the ultimate right to silence him. What are you, sir? You're shut around. Do you think this is the hottest religious thing going? The people here are going to hell. The people you can hurt are going to hell. And when he broke the silence in the courtyard of the Gentiles, they so appreciated him. They had a banquet for him in his own. This blew me away when I kind of put this all together contextually and kind of historically and kind of viscerally trying to be able to destroy The truth is, two days after he said these words, they nailed him to a cross. And we can know all the theological reasons that Jesus was nailed to a cross and the time of God and all of the works. But in the human arena, in the human arena where men and women do their deeds, the reason that he was nailed to a cross is the way he said, well, you're really Christian, you do. Well, I do. Being like Jesus might encourage you. No, I mean, you heard that all your life. Be like Jesus, even maybe in that abusive church, or be like Jesus, but it always meant it didn't ever mean anything more than be nice. I mean, so be nice. But be like Jesus means you'd stand up and say this stuff. That's what it would look like to be like Jesus. And the other word I have an encouragement for you around this is this word, verse chapter 5 of Matthew. Rejoice and be glad if you've been called by God to do this. For your reward in heaven is great, So they persecuted the prophets before you. So they persecuted the prophets before you. Verse 11, blessed are you when men cast insults and you persecute them, say all manner of evil against you, falsehood and economy. I used to think you had to go to Uganda to be persecuted through your faith. When I got in the ministry, I realized all you need to do is, all you need to do is to get persecuted, tell them to be in church. So here's the word. Rejoice. The word in heaven is great. He persecuted the prophets before you. That verse, I would guess for 99.9% of the people in this room means nothing, because most of us feel like, well, how could I put my name in the line with Jeremiah? My name is Edith. My name is George. Jeremiah, Isaiah, if you were used by God to speak the truth, that's what prophets did. He extended my life. which I see exactly right now. And I'm not telling you this. Just be with me. Another characteristic, another impact is they lie, they don't talk straight, they are hardly ever say what they mean. They can't be trusted. What they say is almost always failed, hidden, pious, right, seldom real. Everything has a double meaning. Where are you getting this? Look at verse 16. It's incredible. By the way, have you ever heard that? double talk and stuff in the church. It's like, hey, it's slippery. You can't live. Listen to this. It's an incredible example of double talk. You're laughing. Maybe you're right ahead. What are you blind guys who say, whoever swears by the temple, that is nothing. You're sorry, let it go. Now you're obligated. Verse 18. And whoever swears by the altar, that's nothing. But whoever swears by the altar, now you're obligated. What this guy is doing is he's blind. He's saying, he's kind of, this leader is coming and just trying to make this as practical as possible. will you do this will you do this will you meet me here yeah I swear by the gold and then you don't do it and then you come back why didn't you do that I swear by the temple that's nothing yeah if you swear by the gold that's nothing oh I swear by the altar to swear. To swear, I swear. To swear means to affirm with an oath that what I say is true. And the reason I swear is to say to you, you can trust me. Trust is pretty important, isn't it? I swear on the grave of my sainted mother. Cross my heart and hold the dice, stick a needle in my eye. Court of law, I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God. Now you've got God's name into it. Why bring God's name in it? So you know for sure I tell the truth, because I swear to God. I brought God's name in it. Matthew 5, I remember the study we did in Matthew 5. We discovered that what it really means to take the Lord's name in vain. Now don't be irreverent. So taking the Lord's name in vain, the way I always got yelled at for taking the Lord's name in vain, would be to be irreverent around the Lord's name. But literally in Matthew 5, where that text shows up about taking the Lord's name in vain, what it means is when you take the Lord's name and stick it on a promise that you're not going to keep, you have taken the Lord's name to get somebody to trust you. I swear to God, getting you to trust me, you took God's name in vain. That's what that means. It doesn't just mean you use it in a trite way. Although that would be it too. It's deeper than that. That's why Matthew 5 says don't make vows. Just let your yes be yes and your no be no. Just say what you mean. You see, so you guys make vows and you go, I swear to God. You say those things to get big, to gain trust so you can defraud. Here's the big profound truth. Talk straight. Say what you mean. Don't blow smoke. Or don't BS. It's a little small. It's a little small. This whole thing is double talk. What I hear Jesus saying, in this word, after he says, you know, whoever swears by the temple that has nothing, or so as they will come over, he's obligated. Verse 17, his response to that is, you fools and blind men. Which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold? You blind men. Which is more important, the doctrine or the altar that sanctifies the doctrine? What he's saying is this. People aren't stupid and neither is God. Why do people lie? I mean, do they have this malicious intent when this thing happens? I thought about this a little bit. Why when people, why don't they just say what they need? Why do they just leave me? I don't know the whole reason, but I have a theory of this is what I'm going to close this year. I think it is born out of the soil of this force as well. If you need to look good, ride your black leaves, everybody needs to have a good impression of me. If you need to look good, if you need to please people, if you need to be right, lying is the plant that grows in the soil of a first-to-spike to read especially. You love the place in the banquet, you love the respectful reading, you love everybody who like them, come around, you need to look good. You need to appear to be spiritual all the time, keep the image intact, The product of that will be this. You always say the right thing. I never say the real thing. Why? Because if you say the real thing, somebody might be mad at you. See, the truth is, if you're in leadership, you're going to say, no, I disagree. I love you, but I disagree. And that's letting your no-be-know-in-your-yes. That's saying what you mean. That's just being honest. But if your profound need is to look good, how does that say it? It won't even be like you're going, I'm going to lie now. I'm a dirty, rotten scum. It's not about that. It's born out of you. It's almost like you can't not lie if you need everybody to always have a good impression of you. You can't not lie if everybody's got to think well of you. You'll say what's expedient. You'll say what sounds good. You'll never disagree even if you do. You'll never admit you're wrong even if you are. You just can't look bad. You'll never say I'm sorry. You'll never say forgive me. You'll end up defending things you think are stupid. You know? Because you can't be wrong. You can't look bad. I can't turn around. I don't know. How can you do that if you broaden your back? You're talking about it. I'm going to have to look at it. In fact, I think we've all heard double talk. We've all done double talk. At best, it's major irritation and frustration. At worst, it can destroy people. Because at worst, the reason we rely would be to gain your trust. And when I gain your trust, you relax. And when you relax, I can get this right. I can get you to do this. but I say, I want you to do it. And I can slowly side and only stick in the knife and drain out your life. And that's why victims confuse in a very hard time trusting them because they're dangerous. And I think this is really important, but I'm also glad that after I raise all these issues like this, that the rest of the seminar pretty much, and we're going to still do some more identifying, but a huge portion of our time tomorrow and next day is about healing. In order to talk about healing, we've got to have these issues. Some of you may get right into something, especially if you're doing it. You might have said some of this stuff, right into it. It's very important to say, huh? And I think it's also very important to say, huh? Well, I can't really do that. Lord, I, first of all, I wonder if we could just join in our hearts and thank you for fighting this fight. Every time I read this and study this and teach this again, I feel incredibly grateful for how you thought about it. And the incredible models for the ministry of the Lord, that we didn't see before. Lord, to see you doing this does. It's not a minor matter. It does encourage us to do the same. Because most of us are scared. Because Christ really is time. before we hear your word, bless them. We stand up and do this. And some of the men and women in this room have done that. They've made a price. They're in the process of doing it. Maybe are kind of scared about being here. They're feeling there on their verge of doing this. I pray, Father, that you would take this word tonight, and even already as we go home to our homes and motels that there would come already long and long. Maybe Lord, just knowing that you know about what we feel and what we felt, that we thought we were crazy about, knowing that you know about it and have to trust it all just that by itself. But I pray, Father, for the power of the Holy Spirit for the healing and the power of the Holy Spirit so that as we do, we go out and pray. Thank you.
