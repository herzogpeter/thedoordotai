C.S. Lewis in his book, The Four Loves, speaks eloquently to the dangers of love, for there are in love dangers. And he says this, and I quote, to love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything in your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully around with hobbies and little luxuries. Avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your self-protection. But in that coffin, your heart will change. It will not be broken. It will become unbreakable. impenetrable irredeemable the only place outside of heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is hell end quote and this I pray Paul says in verse 9 of chapter 1 knowing that love is not safe I pray that your love may abound. And it's as if I hear Paul saying, and this I pray, that you would exercise courage more and more, that more and more you would run the risk and open your heart to love, even though it is dangerous, more and more. In this prayer I hear him saying, more and more, this I pray, that you would come to life. and this I pray that you would have the courage to climb out of your coffin of self-protection more and more and come to love. I need to just draw your attention to something that your attention is already on and that's the noise. So between services that it's an amp that's in the process right now of going out and we can't get to it. It didn't happen during the worship. It's evidently hooked into this somehow, so it's probably going to happen as I go through this. And just put our finger on it, now let it go, and just ask the Spirit of God to help us concentrate through it, and for me too. But I just wanted to say that and get it out of there. For some among us, as we are dealing with this issue of love and this call to love by the Apostle Paul, this call to love has been met in your hearts over these weeks. For some, with deep waters of desire, you've heard this call to love, and deep within you, really, simply, it's been there. You want this. You feel ready for this. You are open wide to this. More and more of this you want. Others, in hearing this call to love, have found it met in your heart with a sting of conviction. And for some, it's been a sweet sting, but a sting, nonetheless, that has, as we've dealt with this through the Word, helped you become more and more aware of some ways in which you maybe don't love very well. But your spirit, you found, has continually been open to the ways in which God wants to bring more of this to you. And it does for you feel like life, but there are others. As this word has come, you have found it met in your heart with, not desire or conviction, more with fear. Even a sort of terror may be protected by even anger, but certainly a hardness to this and a resistance to this. But it isn't a hardness born of rebellion. You see, your heart has been wounded by love betrayed. And love betrayed creates a wound that makes it very hard for us to love. And hear any words or calls to love. Resistance in you toward the prayer of Paul, again, would not be about disobedience or rebellious hardness. It's more about fear. I have thought long of all the places where in three services, people coming and filling this place up, where all of the places are that we might be as it relates to this call and our ability to hear it and move in it. And my conclusion is this, wherever we are, the message is the same and the prayer remains the same. I do still pray this, wherever you are, that your love may abound. For wherever you are, a call to love is a kind beseeching. For a call to love, beloved, even if it's a fearful thing, is a call to life. A call to love is a call for God's people to climb out of the coffin of self-protection. For it is in fact a coffin. A call to love, as hard as it might be to hear, having been possibly wounded horribly by love betrayed, a call to love is a call to not accept a walled-in life as life. That is death. Paul's calling us to life. And this I pray that your love may abound. But Paul put a qualifier on this prayer. And the qualifier was that your love may abound in real knowledge and all discernment of what love really is. That means this love he's calling us to is not gullible. It is not naive. It is not shallow. It is not just warm and gooey. It is not blind. And because of that fact, we've been asking this question over the last couple of weeks. Then what is love? Not just generally what is love, but specifically, what is the kind of love that Paul is praying might abound in us? Last week I indicated at least two places where we can get some help in answering that question. Number one, last week we got some help in simply defining the specific word Paul uses in the text for love, and that was agape. Indicated that there are four Greek words for love. There is eros, erotic or sexual love. It's not the word he uses. Another Greek word for love is storge or family love. It's spoken of as being natural affection. That's what storge is. Natural affection being that of a mother for a child, a father for his children as well. That's natural affection. Just a little note there. By natural affection, I do not mean automatic. For some mothers don't love their children and fathers don't. But that is a turning away from natural affection. That's what storge is. Phileo is friendship. It's brotherly love. It's mutual love. I open myself to you. You open yourself to me. It is phileo love that is enjoyed in your most intimate relationships, among your garden friends, the people with whom you feel the safest. It is a wonderful and spirit-induced, empowered, gift love. But that is not the word. The word he chooses is agape, which includes all of the aspects of phileo and store, gay, save, one. It is not dependent on, contingent upon mutuality. Agape love is a love extended without promise of return. It is a love extended without promise of relationship or receptivity. It is a love that acts in the best interest of the person I am loving without strings. It is a love that acts in your best interest without a desire to control at the same time. It's why agape love is able to confront when it needs to confront. Because I'm not doing it to get you to like me. I do what is honestly best for you. That's why agape love stood in the courtyard of the Gentiles as did Jesus. And called the Pharisees to account for their seeing their sin and repenting of their sin was their only possibility for life. But agape love gives for free. We have all been loved with strings attached. And love with strings attached is a love that is given to us, or nice things given to us, not for free, but so that we perform in some way. It is, in fact, manipulation. Agape is not that. Agape is marked by things like courage, sacrifice, and risk. It is embodied in Jesus himself who, Romans chapter 5, demonstrated his love toward us. And that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. And the picture we got in there of agape love was that while we were yet sinners, God made the first move. Agape love, whatever else it does, however else it looks, makes the first move. Before we moved toward him, before we ever loved him, he moved toward us. He set his love on us. Agape love makes the first move and therein lies the risk. For if agape love would begin by the Spirit to flow through me to you or to someone that I love, I am running an enormous risk that somewhere along the line I might lower my guard and you might not. And the risk now is I might get hammered again. It is the very risk that Jesus took when he came and died for sinners while they were still sinners. Before they turned around, he took the risk for me. I have turned around and said I'm grateful for the gift. It paid off, if you will, but he did it before he knew that. It would pay off with you or with me. So we got some pictures of love from that definition of the word. There was another place I said we could get some help. We go there now, 1 Corinthians 13, where Paul, using the same word agape, spreads it out as it were on a canvas, showing us the shades of love, what C.S. Lewis would call faces of love. And here we hear things like this. Love is patient, but it's not just patient. It's kind, but it's not just kind. It isn't jealous. It doesn't brag, and on and on it goes. Turn in your Bibles with me to 1 Corinthians 13. Where we will attempt over the next couple of weeks to get a better picture of what love looks like. So that we know what Paul's praying for when he prays that love might abound. Now, every time we come to something like this, one of the things we have to do in order to understand what it is that Paul's saying is get some background. The first thing we need to know as we approach chapter 13 to have an understanding of what he's saying. is this, that while Paul here in chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians is dealing with the same theme of Philippians chapter 1, that is love, he is writing it for an entirely different purpose. In Philippians, he is speaking to people who already were loving one another. And he is calling them to more of what they already have. In Corinth, he is speaking to a body of believers who were not loving one another. Divisions and factions were what marked them most. and he is calling them to establish what they sorely lack. And that fact affects how we view and understand 1 Corinthians 13. For far from a sweet-smelling soliloquy on love, nice to read at weddings, though it is nice to read at weddings, Paul never had that in mind when he wrote 1 Corinthians 13. For 1 Corinthians 13 is a powerful confrontation on a people lacking love. in fact in chapter 13 it's as if chapter 13 which is the one we read at weddings and isn't that sweet is the most powerful dimension of a confrontation that began in chapter 1 let me tell you about the Corinthians they are marked first of all by their carnality another way to say that is by their spiritual immaturity in chapter 3 verse 1 he laments the fact that he could not and I quote I could not speak to you as to spiritual men and the word men there is human men and women I could not speak to you as spiritual people but as to people of flesh as to babes in Christ now that phrase is wrought with frustration I couldn't do it I wanted to do it I should have been able to do it but I couldn't do it and the reason he couldn't speak to them as mature men and women is revealed in chapter 3, verse 3. For they are walking, he says, you are walking like mere men. Like mere humans. Now, the reason that's frustrating is because of this. By virtue of the new birth, they are not mere men. By virtue of the life of Christ in them, the Spirit of God in them, By that presence and by that power, they were capable by the Spirit in them to be living differently than they were. You are, Corinthians, by the Spirit in you, capable of obedience. You are. You are, Corinthians, by the Spirit, capable of holiness in your life. You are by the Spirit capable of harmony with one another and love. You are capable of growth. And you have been redeemed for a while, but I'm still talking to you like babes. And that's very frustrating. I have to speak to you as if you are mere men. That's frustrating because you are not mere men. You are not. You are in, filled, indwelt by the God who made the world. And you haven't grown at all. You're capable of more by the Spirit. I want you to hear this. there is an I can't do it that comes from our lips that is a powerful spiritual deep recognition of our frailty in the flesh to pull off anything that God would have us do that results in dependence on the life and power of the spirit to do all that God has called us to do at the core of the gospel there needs to be a recognition that it is the broken men and women who come into the kingdom blessed are the broken blessed are those who recognize they can't in their flesh by their striving save themselves and when they recognize they can't they come up looking for a work of the spirit that could make them new and they get the kingdom they get redeemed blessed are those who recognize that by their own striving they can't sanctify themselves when they recognize they can't in their flesh do it they come up hungry for the filling of the Spirit. Blessed are those who recognize in their flesh they can't serve the Lord and spread the gospel because those who recognize they can't come up hungry for the power and anointings of the Spirit of God to do work that is beyond their flesh. It is in recognizing we can't do it, thus resulting in dependence on the Spirit that power is born. But there is another kind of I can't do it that comes from our lips and lives in our heart and certainly was among the Corinthians. That is not what I just described. It is not a recognition of the frailty of my flesh that results in dependence on the Spirit that results in power. Sometimes that I can't do it expression is in fact a denial of the power and the presence of the Spirit. Sometimes that I can't do it is a denial of the fact that Christ is alive in me. And because of that, there is potential to grow and do the things that are beyond me in the flesh. And a result of that kind of I can't, which kind of translates this way. I can't obey. I can't love. I can't grow. so I'm somehow excused, results in us walking like mere men. And you want to know something? When you find people redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, indwelt by the Spirit of God, who are walking like mere men, it's very frustrating. Whether you find them in Corinth or Philippi or here in Minneapolis, it's very frustrating. You know why? Because we are not mere human. We are indwelt new creatures, born of the Spirit. who in the flesh we can't, but by the Spirit, there comes life and power. It was to a group of twelve, more than that, in the final day before Jesus ascended, that he said, I say to you, go into all the world and preach the gospel. At that particular time in their life, they were never more convinced that in their flesh they couldn't do it. And so they waited for the Spirit. and by the Spirit they began to go. Now, this walking like mere men reality manifested itself among the Corinthians in a number of ways. But nowhere was it more apparent, this walking like mere men, than when they came together. In chapter 11, 17, just before our focus of chapter 13, we hear him say an amazing thing to a body of believers. Feature someone saying this to us. He says to them, when you come together, it's not for the better, it's for the worse. Think on that. I mean, it may be a verse you've heard before, and so we don't think deeply of it. Have you ever been to a church that when you went, rather than for the better, rather than being built up, rather than being edified, that rather than having an encounter with God by His grace, through His Spirit, you walk away worse off than when you came. If you've ever experienced that, you've been to Corinth. I mean, contrast that to places like Hebrews chapter 10, verse 25. When it says, don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together, as is the habit of some. When you come together, encourage each other. That's what happens when we come together. It says things like, it says things like, consider how to stimulate. When you come together, consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds. Think about that phrase. Considering how to stimulate one another to love. You get up in the morning, it's Sunday morning. I don't know if I want to go to church. I'm kind of tired. Okay, maybe I'll go. On your way to church, you're kind of thinking about what's going to meet you there. Church described in Hebrews 10 is a church that a bunch of people are coming together trying to think of ways how to love each other better. What a deal. Getting creative. That would be an easy place to go. that would be a place that when I went it would be for the better not for the worse there would be edification there would be building up there would be encouragement didn't happen in Corinth verse 18 chapter 11 divisions and factions exist among you that's what I hear and I believe it he says at the end of verse 18 interesting thing to say verse 20 and 21 he talks of the agape feast being defiled, becoming a mockery. The agape feast was something that they did in connection in the early church with their communion celebration. And the agape feast was what it sounds like. Agape is we come together and we practice agape. That is, I come together to minister to you and you come to minister to me and we give to one another. That's what agape is. And in their feast, it was literally a meal, it says this. when you meet together it's not to eat the Lord's Supper it's not to celebrate your love for one another in your eating, verse 21 each one takes his own supper first and one is hungry and another is drunk you come together and all you're thinking about is yourself and making sure you get fed and that fed thing would here be physical it could be spiritual the whole preoccupation is me it's me one here was full the other was drunk. Take the alcohol metaphor out of it. What you've got in a church or a fellowship where love does not live and move, you've got somebody over here getting nothing, somebody over here getting more than they need. They're drunk. And nobody here is getting drunk, but does that dynamic ever happen? More than you need. Love in a body is recognizing that when it comes together, we are here not just to do this, but to do this as well. I can't do this unless I'm getting something. That is true. But the intent, being creative, figuring out ways to stimulate love. Not only was the agape feast of mockery, but communion was defiled. Their meal was a mess. But then they would go to the table and they would break the bread and they would celebrate the cup, the Lord's death, until he comes. Paul then in these next verses gives some teaching on that. And then in verse 27, some frightening words come. When he says, this Corinthians, because of your divisiveness and factions, when you eat the bread and drink the cup, you are guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. Pretty heavy words, whatever that means. Pretty scary. I wouldn't want to be guilty of that, whatever it means. Verse 29, when you eat and drink, you drink judgment to yourself and eat judgment to yourself that doesn't sound like a good thing what does that mean? how would I be taking communion in such a way that it would be bringing judgment to myself that it would in some way make me guilty of the body and blood of the Lord well it says in verse 27 if you take communion in an unworthy manner Now, I've got to wonder, I've just got a zinger for all of you who've grown up in church. That word goes way deep inside of you. And some of your fear of never taking communion in an unworthy manner has kept you from the table. Here's my, who is ever worthy to come to the table if we shouldn't take it in an unworthy manner? and it has released all sorts of things that have mitigated against the very essence and nature of the table. Some of you come to communion and you're so worried about not being worthy. You did something last night or last week or last month and obviously I'm not worthy. When in fact the table is a wonderful place to be mindful of your sin and to repent of your sin and to enter in again to grace. Unworthy is not that you're perfect. the unworthiness of the Corinthians is clear what it was. It says at the end of verse 29, you do not judge the body rightly. That's what makes you unworthy of the table. What does it mean to not judge the body rightly? It was basically simply saying this. We come together, I don't need you. I don't need you. I'm not connected to you. And for me to believe that I am not intimately, eternally connected to every believer in this room is not judging the body rightly. For we are by the Spirit, by the same living Christ in me that is in you, eternally connected. I kept judging the body wrongly. I'm aloof from you. And you know what? If I'm disconnected from you, it doesn't matter how I treat you. What defiles communion is not that you did bad this week. You know, not many of you did good this week. We come here for grace and healing and repentance. What defiles communion is when we celebrate communion and there is no communion. What a joke that is. There is no agape love. Don't come to the table. Because that's what the table is about. We are all partakers of his life. Same loaf. That's why the beauty of one loaf is good. It's all. We're all partakers of this same life. Jesus. We are participants of the same death and the same resurrection. But divisions and factions all take care of me. For this reason. For what reason? Not judging the body rightly. I don't give a rip about you. I'm here to take care of me. For that reason, many among you are weak, Corinthians. Sick and a number sleep. A little word about that. speaking here of judgments so it kind of sounds I've always kind of thought this in fact that what this means is if you take communion in an unworthy manner that is love is not existing communion is not consistent because you have no communion that God's going to judge you by making you weak and making you sick and making you die kind of thing and God can do what he wants and judgments like that would not be beyond something that would be consistent with portions of scripture But you know what? I don't think that's the best rendering of the text. I think the best rendering of the text is understanding this. You know what? People get weak. All week long. We come to church weak. Weary from the week of the month, the events of life. And people get sick. And some people sleep. They sleep physically. That means they die. They sleep spiritually. That means they're dead in their sin. and when there isn't any love in the body you know what this I think means? it means this when people who are weak and are sick and are dead come and there is no love because there is no love the presence of Jesus himself is not going to be manifested there and that's not even because he's mad at us it's more that it's not consistent with his nature he is love a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another In this is all the law and the prophets fulfilled, that you love God and you love each other. And when you love one another, I am freedom. Be there. And when I'm there, I will be me. And who I am is love and who I am is life and who I am is healing and who I am is strength. You know, every once in a while we have breakthroughs in our thinking. Healing, the gifts of the Spirit. Resurrection, physically and evangelistically. Weak people being made strong. I think of seeing that, and I would call that signs and wonders. Breakthrough I had several years ago, we had as a church, was breaking through a spirit of unbelief among us relative to God doing His miraculous power today. God brought us through theologically, understanding experientially faith into a place where we came to believe. The gifts of the Spirit are for today. And a lot of our energy, importantly, was about learning to believe and know and walk in the gifts and experience them and release them. And we go to conferences where we can learn how to do them better and do it. Let's keep doing it. But... Want to release the Spirit? you want to see gifts flow you want to see weak people made strong sick people made well dead people raised from the dead love one another love one another love one another and the gifts will flow for Jesus will be present there and he will do who he is among us do you know what in the middle of this mess that was in Corinth this divisiveness, these factions there was one thing the Corinthians still prided themselves on and by the way you just need to know by the 12th chapter Paul has hammered them on just about every aspect of their lifestyle but the one place they prided themselves was in their ability to do the gifts of the spirit say it differently get it away from the gifts to accomplish great things for god they accomplished great things for god paul affirms the fact that they were indeed strong in that in chapter 1 verse 7 when he says you come behind in no gift if they excelled in anything they excelled in this in chapter 12 of first corinthians in chapter 14 of first corinthians with our study right in the middle. He speaks to them of spiritual gifts. Verse 1, chapter 12, now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren. And he speaks to them of manifestations of the Spirit, signs and wonders, if you will. Now, chapter 12 and 14, as most of you know, is by Paul to them a corrective. For they were, though moving in the gifts of the Spirit, in their expression of the gifts of the spirit out of control and lacking discernment among other things but even though chapter 12 and 14 was a corrective to them there was there was this reality that they were still good at this it would be like i don't know if this is a good old story but it'd be like somebody in at the professional level of athletics who's really doing pretty good who gets a few and if you did this and if you didn't if you stop doing that great thanks for the help but i'm telling you what I pretty much hit the ball. Words of knowledge all the time. Gift of tongues. Don't worry about me. I'm there. So even though it's a corrective, Paul is still dealing with them in an arena where they excelled, in an arena where they felt pretty good about themselves. With that in mind, now consider chapter 13 right in the middle of those two chapters on the gifts. Beginning with these words. In chapter 12, 31. You really do the gifts. You do need some adjustments. And they're really wonderful and they are excellent. But earnestly desire the greater gifts. Well, what could they be? I show you a still more excellent way. For if I speak with tongues of men and of angels. Which you do, Corinthians, all the time. but don't have love, I'm a noisy gong. I'm a clanging cymbal. I'm going to talk then about verse 2, gift of prophecy, knowledge, faith to move mountains. We're going to talk about giving our possessions to feed the poor in verse 3. If you don't remember one thing I say about any of that, know this, that what Paul is saying in these three verses, which we're going to deal with, that's all we'll get to this morning. At the core, what he's saying is this. Corinthians, you need to understand something. Church of the Open Door, you need to understand something. It is entirely possible to accomplish good things. And yet accomplish nothing good. It is possible to accomplish excellent things. And yet to in fact accomplish nothing that is excellent. For without the agape of God, none of the things you accomplish, even though to the physical human eye they look good, They are of no value in kingdom life. Let's look briefly at these this morning. And as we do, just know that looking at these three verses is just giving us a way to pick up a little bit more of what love looks like. What love looks like. Tongues without love. It's a noisy gong. It's a clanging symbol. It's nothing. Some argue that the tongues of men here are speaking of human eloquence, not the gift of tongues. And if that is true, then the lesson still stands. If you speak with great eloquence but don't have love, your eloquence is not building the body. It's just offensive. I just don't think that's what he's speaking of here. Born, I think, out well in the context of chapter 12, the gifts, chapter 14, specifically tongues and prophecy, when he speaks of tongues, even two verses before chapter 13. All do not have gifts of healing, do they? Of course not. All do not speak in tongues, do they? Of course not. The very next verse he is speaking of tongues, he's speaking of the gift of tongues. I want to note, as he is saying tongues without love is nothing, that he is by that in no way minimizing or devaluing tongues. In chapter 14, verse 18, After he says this comparative tongues without love is nothing, he says, I speak with tongues more than you all. Obviously, a vital, wonderful gift to the body, in the body. But without love, it's a noisy gong and it's an offensive noise. Ask yourself this question. What would tongues without love look like? Now, I don't know if you find that an odd question, but I kind of did because I thought, well, what other motive than love could there be for tongues? I mean, my understanding of tongues is that it is essentially a prayer, a praise language. There are other nuances of it, but at the core, it is a praise language. It is born of love. It is about love. I would liken it much to worship. I mean, what other motive than love would there be to raise our hands in worship? So I'm a little confused by love without tongues. What does it mean? Should I just make sure every time I speak in tongues, I do it in like a loving way? Or like, don't do it in tongues when you're crabby. Do it in a loving way. What does it mean? How about this? How about love, tongues without love? Being when I begin to use my gifts and see my gifts as more than just a gift that God gave me because of his grace. What if I begin to see my gift of tongues or your gift of tongues and begin to use it as that which affirms or establishes my identity in Christ. Or my value in Christ. Or my status in the body. Some do in fact teach, and I would argue with them theologically, but embrace them as a brother. That the sign of the filling of the Spirit is the gift of tongues. I believe and teach that the gift of tongues is a sign of the filling of the Spirit. But if you want to look for signs that men and women are filled with the Spirit, look for and discern such things as love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, patience, kindness. Those are the things born of the Spirit, indicating that God is in control of this human thing. but if I begin to believe that my gift of tongues or your gift of tongues is what gives you status or superiority in the body tongues will no longer be a gift in the body it will become a weapon to wound deeply people who have not been given by the spirit that gift you need to hear again all do not speak in tongues do they? no they don't and if you do you're not better and if you don't you're not worse But tongues without love is when you begin to think, this is what I'll hold to affirm my value. It hurts my ears just thinking about it. It's a noisy gong. It's a clanging cymbal. By the way, if you really want to get, without any histrionics at all, a picture of what love, tongues without love looks like, just read chapter 14. Chapter 14, Paul confronts their use of prophecy and tongues. For they were using both of those gifts in the body in a chaotic way designed to simply draw attention to themselves. Not to exalt the Lord, though that's what they would say. It was all designed to go, look at me, aren't I spiritual? Chapter 14, verse 26 says this. What is the outcome then of your expression of the gifts? When you assemble, each one of you has a psalm. Each one of you has a teaching. Each one of you has a revelation. Each one of you has a tongue. Each one of you has an interpretation. And I used to look at that and think, well that's the way it ought to be we ought to all come with a psalm and share it and all come with us a tongue and share it interpret it that wasn't what was going on here in the greek it's real clear that they were doing it all at once it was like a contest i gotta listen i got something from god and in my prophecy that i have from god to you what that was was silly talk that was not my prayer language i shouldn't have done that it's going to confuse you there was i do this all But anyway, I have a prayer language. I have a prayer. That wasn't it. But it sure sounded good. Kind of sounded like. Anyway, gee, why did I do that? There is a prophecy that would move in me and a word that would come from me and you that is born of love to build a body. There is another expression of all those things that is designed, especially if I believe it's what gives me value, to affirm my value. I'm more spiritual than anybody. Listen to this. Listen. Listen to this prophecy. Hear now my tongue. Paul says, you need to know something. When you have people in the body who don't speak in tongues and don't understand what you're saying, your tongues don't edify anybody but you. And your big problem, Corinthians, is not that you don't speak in tongues, it's that you don't care about anybody but yourself. So you really don't care, verse 16, if the one who is ungifted is unable to say amen. When you go off and speak in tongues, you are giving thanks well enough, verse 17, but the other man isn't edified. And in Corinth, they didn't care if anybody else was edified. I'm here to take care of me. I love chapter 14, verse 1. It says, pursue love. yet desire earnestly the spiritual gifts there's your balance as a church we will desire earnestly spiritual gifts for healing to come and words to come so we can be directed and know the mind and the work and the direction that God would have us go and we will ask his spirit to fall and earnestly desire that but with all our heart pursue love you do that the gifts will flow prophecy mysteries knowledge without love you are nothing prophecy can articulate truth mysteries you see truth that other people don't see knowledge you know truth I would call them the seers mysteries the knowers knowledge the sayers prophets and what vital gifts they are in the body how lost we would be if they weren't functioning. For it is by the Spirit, through the Word, using vessels of clay, men and women who are seers and knowers and sayers, that we hear God's voice, beloved. And God's voice active in the church protects us from the lies of the evil one and it leads us through minefields of a culture that is given to the evil one and through the seers and the knowers and the sayers by the Spirit we are liberated by God's truth and we are healed and we are warned from time to time. But without love it's worthless. But the gift is vital. In fact, I believe, we believe these kinds of gifts are vital. So much so, do we value seeing and knowing and saying that sometimes we excuse among the prophets and overlook among the prophets a lack of love. I don't know if you've ever heard yourself kind of think this or say this of someone who was prophetic. Well, you know those prophets. They just all kind of have an edge on them. well I think there is in fact a godly anger from time to time there are some things we ought to be angry about but to use that to excuse a lack of kindness because I told the truth I told the truth yeah you did but you weren't kind make no mistake prophets tell the truth make no mistake when prophets tell the truth the truth sometimes hurts and do not confuse an infliction of pain with a lack of love sometimes the most loving thing that can be done is for someone to tell you the truth in love it would not be love if I stood here and needed to address our congregation about sin and did not say it out loud it would not be love for you that would keep me from speaking it would be worrying about me and making sure everybody liked me the prophet born of love says hard things but the truth without love is no longer a gift The truth without love does incredible damage to the body of Christ. And when we come together, we come together to build the body up. So let the prophets use their gift to build the body up. 1 Corinthians 8.1 says, Knowledge puffs up. Love builds up. Knowledge makes you feel better about yourself. You know, I thought of that. I thought of ways in which I use knowledge or my preaching to kind of wall myself in. It's like, you can't get me if I'm right. Do you know what I mean? You ever do that? You can't get me if I'm right. And I protect myself with that. Knowledge isn't a bad thing. Speaking truth isn't a bad thing. Think of the things you're good at. Think of them. And the ways you use the things you're good at to protect yourself from love. You can't get to me when I'm doing this, and when I'm smoking here, you can't get to me now. And I use it to insulate myself from love and isolate myself from people. You know one of the traps of knowledge puffing up is that if I use knowledge to feel good about myself, use it to feed me, it works. It works. Because if I acquire knowledge, I can by that feel good about me. And you can too. But there's a problem. We're here in a church saying we're doing kingdom stuff. And when we come together, the purpose of our coming together isn't for me to feel better. It's to build the body. Love does that. You take knowledge. And you take seeing. And you take saying. Blended with love. And you got a gift that builds the body. faith to move mountains without love is nothing more than nothing I don't want to be guilty of adding to scripture here but I think it's more than nothing I think it's dangerous because faith even faith that moves mountains without love runs people over can I tell you a good reason why a good motive a proper motive a God blessed motive for moving mountains in a church like ours we want to move mountains why? because in the moving of mountains we will move mountains to get to broken hungry mourning people who are desperate to hear of God's amazing grace and to get that word out and to share this life of grace and to give away this life and this spirit that we have found we by faith will move mountains the motive there is love but sometimes moving the mountain becomes more important than the motive of love and sometimes in the name of by faith moving mountains people get crushed even in the name of doing God's holy work and all of a sudden you don't matter don't you see we're moving a mountain here Get out of the way. Don't get out of the way. We're going to run you over. Well, good. And we move the mountains, see, so it's okay. Well, well, you know, people might get away with that in their life. People might do a ministry their whole life of moving mountains and run over people. And all their life, accolades of men and women. What a guy. What a woman. Men and women of faith. And in that final day, face to face, we will find out, wood, hay, stubble, not gold, silver, precious things. Moving mountains by faith without love is nothing. Nothing. In the name of mountain moving faith, preachers like me have abandoned their families. Family, you're just going to have to understand, I'm moving a mountain for God. Nothing. in the name of mountain moving faith we use people in the name of mountain moving faith we protect ourselves if I'm a mountain mover I can feel pretty safe behind there see nobody's going to confront me about a lack of love are they? or nobody's going to confront you about a lack of love if you're a mountain mover are they? because we need mountain movers so oh it's okay if they don't love and we need prophets and we need to hear the truth and we'll just put up with the unkind spirits okay another little switch on this you know bodies organizational things demonstrate their lack of love when they let the mountain movers among them get away with lack of love when they let the prophets among them get away with the lack of kindness because love for our mountain movers and love for our prophets would be expressed in saying you don't have love. And you moved the mountain, but you weren't kind. And we value kindness and we value love more than we do the moving of the mountain. And you know what's weird? To not confront our prophets and not to confront our mountain movers demonstrates our lack of love for them because basically the reason we don't confront them is because we're using them. You hear that? We're using them. They're moving mountains. I like to be part of something where the mountains are moving. We're prophets. I like to hear the truth. We're just using them. If we loved them, we'd tell them about the more excellent way. See? This cuts so many ways. Mountain moving faith gets the job done. It gets the job done, but without love it's worthless. Gerald May in his book called Love or the Awakened Heart says this about this in a way that kind of says it with a different spin and because of that I kind of awakened my ear to it listen to these words as it relates to just what Paul's saying here in becoming adults we have been conditioned to believe that efficiency getting the job done is more important than love efficiency is the how of love he says the how of life rather, how we meet and handle the demands of daily living, how we survive, grow and create. In contrast, love is the why of life, why we are functioning at all and what we want to be efficient for. Love needs to come first. It should be the beginning of and the reason for everything we do. But it gets mixed up so easily. When I was a young parent, I wanted to take good care of my children, efficiency, getting the job done. But the reason I wanted to was because of love. This was the way it should be. But soon I became preoccupied with efficiency, getting the job done. What were my kids eating? Were they getting enough sleep? Would they be on time for the carpool? My concerns about efficiency, getting the job done, began to eclipse the love that they were meant to serve. Getting to the carpool on time became more important than attending to the small fear or hurt feeling. I was so wrapped up in getting the job done, I didn't even hear the small fear or hurt feeling. I didn't even look for it. It didn't matter. Getting the job done is what matters now. Too often the report card, the preeminent symbol of childhood efficiency, getting the job done, was more significant than the hopes and fears of the little one who brought it home. It happens to us all. Some people are so caught up in striving for getting the job done, his word is efficiency, that love seems like a luxury or even an obstacle to efficient functioning. Taken far enough, This makes for the ominous prospect of people who are very unloving, but very efficient at what they do. They get the job done, and without love, you haven't done the job. Final one, sacrifice without love. Give my possessions to the poor, deliver my body to be burned, but not love. I profit nothing. Again, the question I have is, what other motive than love would there be for giving? I think the verse is saying this while genuine love always does give while genuine love is always serving and always sacrificial what you need to understand is that all giving and all serving and all sacrifice is not all born of love for the truth is this an awful lot of what looks like giving and serving and sacrifice is in fact a look at me ploy is in fact designed not to give but to get, not to serve but to gain not to sacrifice but to acquire, to control and to manipulate pull it all together without love it really is possible to do really good things, even offer your body to be burnt and yet produce nothing that is good final question how can I tell if even in the good things I'm doing they are not being motivated by love which means they are wood, hay, stubble not gold, silver, precious things how can I tell now we're ready to deal with the rest of the passage here's how you can tell verse 4 for love is patient makrothumia long to anger and when I think of the fact that some things ought to make me angry. Let's leave that there and know that. I think in my daily life of the kinds of things that just rise up in me and ready to not kill. Thumas, explosive anger. Generally, they are things that someone interfered with an agenda I had, and I come up angry. And the reason I'm angry and have no patience is because my bottom line, core commitment in life is to me. Love is patient. That's how you can tell. Love is kind. You move the mountain face to face with Jesus one day. You move the mountain. What I wanted to know is were you kind? You didn't care about the right thing. and this I pray that your love may abound still more and more and this I pray that your patience may abound and your kindness may abound last night at the close of the service no it was during the worship I came to believe that God was giving me a word about how to close I had prayed all day long I didn't know I thought well we'll just meet and pray like we always have and that's fine but God gave me a word and I've tested it out a number of ways to come to believe that it is that that we needed to close our service this morning and last night with a healing service that if I would step out in faith and believe and act on this that Jesus would be present among us for healing in a very specific area that is very very needed for us to even continue on in the series I'm doing. And that is this. Not in a voice, but in my spirit it was communicated. David, there are people here who are badly wounded by love betrayed. Now, the truth is that there isn't anybody in this room who hasn't been by love betrayed and has not been in some way wounded by love betrayed. All of us have. but we're the ones on a hook this morning especially and and and that means that maybe everybody should come maybe every that would be fine if everybody came but the ones that that i think the word is specifically for though it is for everybody specifically it is for those who are having a terrible time even hearing these sermons right now rebellion is not what's in your heart you're hearing these things and saying i by the spirit in me want to have love abounding in me, but it's fear that's going, I can't let that in. I can't let that in. I have been so wounded and so betrayed by love before. And I'll try to walk by the Spirit, and I'll try to put it on. What you need is a healing. And what I believe, it has been here last night, it was here this morning, that Jesus is here, present, to bring healing to some of you for a heart wound. so what I want to do in our closing is ask those who resonate with this kind of word who can just tell I've just been holding this thing off the more he talks the more scared I get because the wound to come for healing I want others to come too who would be willing to pray with us as we pray I believe I'm supposed to pray over you I want the altar ministry to come you might want to receive people who have other needs this morning because this isn't the only need this morning. But I want to speak to the altar ministry quickly here and that is to give you freedom to either receive other people or be part of what we're doing here. Just stand as we close. 1 Corinthians 11 says, For the divisions and factions among you, many are weak, many are sick, and many sleep. But by the presence of Jesus Christ alive in this place, many will this morning be made strong and be made well and be raised up Jesus I pray that as we move into this ministry time many of us having to leave many of us able to stay that by your spirit you would indeed be present with us and give to us your gifts and touch the men and women who so desperately need something that only you can give healing for a wounded heart betrayed by love Give courage to those who need to come. In Jesus' name, amen.
