Let's pray as we move into the ministry of the Word. My request is this, Father, that we would have this morning eyes to see, ears to hear, Hands that learn to help and feet that learn to follow. This one we are coming to know as our rabbi, your son, Jesus. And I pray this in the name of your son, Jesus. Amen. Last week, in the context of this series of sermons that we are referring to as the way of the rabbi, we talked about, among other things, two kingdoms. Number one, the kingdom of God, and two, the kingdom or kingdoms of this world that are different kinds of kingdoms, radically so, not only in nature and mission, but method as well. And it was the method of these two kingdoms that we talked about last week. Indeed, the title of the sermon was Our Rabbi's Strategy or Our Rabbi's Method for bringing the influence of God's kingdom into the kingdoms of this world, not with a power over strategy, which is the strategy of the kingdoms of this world, but with a power under strategy, not with the power of the sword, which we used last week as the symbol of power over authority, but with the power of a cross, with the kingdom that Jesus was speaking of and inviting people into, come. A cross to which our rabbi is still calling his Talmudim, his followers, to join him in carrying as the primary way. of fulfilling the purposes of God in the world, of manifesting the kingdom of God in the world, of revealing the face of God to the world. That's the way. Power under, not power over. Everybody we've been dialing into in this story of our rabbi was amazed when they first heard Jesus speak of the kingdom, and then when he demonstrated power, they were even more interested. But when he began to speak of the way the kingdom he spoke of and embodied would come, many began to withdraw from him, not following him anymore, because they simply did not believe any more than people today believe that this power underway had any real power to make what's wrong with the world right. power under as being the primary way. There were three scriptures we referred to last week as being the primary sources that help paint the picture of this. John's gospel, 18th chapter, Jesus is before Pilate and is asked by Pilate, are you the king of the Jews? Jesus' response, I am. But my kingdom is not of this world, which didn't mean his kingdom wasn't in the world. It It meant my kingdom is not like the world's kingdoms. For if it were, it would be obvious, because my servants would be fighting, that I might not be delivered up to the Jews. In other words, if my kingdom was like these kingdoms, they would be using the method that the kingdoms of this world use to win things like this. With power over, they would be fighting. But as it is, my kingdom is not of this realm. So it doesn't try to accomplish what it wants to accomplish that way, using that strategy. Matthew 20, 25, same thing, said a different way. Jesus is speaking to the disciples this time and says, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them. And the great men exercise authority over them. Because in the kingdoms of this world, power over is how you get done what you need to get done. but it's not so among you, verse 26. For I came, verse 28, not to be served, but to serve, and to give my life a ransom for many, and not only just to do that, but to then show you how to do the same. Matthew 26 is the other scripture we use. Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane. He is being arrested. Peter pulls out his sword to which Jesus says in verse 52 of Matthew 26, put your sword away, Peter. Why? Here's why. Because the bottom line in the kingdom of God, the message keeps coming through over and over again. The bottom line in the kingdom of God is that the way we will fight and the way we will win will not be by picking up a sword, but by taking up a cross, which in the Garden of Gethsemane, after he tells Peter to put away his sword, is precisely what Jesus then does as he moves to the cross. And in that moving to the cross, it's as if he's saying, I know you don't get it, and you still don't get it, so let me show you what I mean. Let me show you how this works. Because the primary way, I'm not budging on this, says Jesus, in Gethsemane, as he finally does go to the cross, the primary way, I know you don't believe it, but the primary way that the purposes of God are advanced and the kingdom of God is made manifest so people can actually see it, and the face of God, who he really is, is revealed to the world, will not be by cutting off our enemy's ears, but by healing them, by demonstrating in tangible ways a supernatural, sacrificial love, even for an enemy. For it was while we were yet sinners, enemies of God, that Christ died for us. But all of that stuff I talked about last week, and by the way, that was my sermon last week, which means I could have done it a lot quicker. All that power under stuff we talked about last week raises a question that actually more than one of you asked me over the last couple of weeks, the question is this. How do we reconcile this power under love your enemies theme, love your enemies strategy that Jesus so clearly articulates and demonstrates in the New Testament with all of the places in the Old Testament where God very clearly seems to be using power over strategy, power over method, where he doesn't seem to deal with his enemies by giving them a big hug. Have you ever noticed that? Has it bothered you? The apparent difference between the old and the new. Deuteronomy 7, just one example of many examples where the people of God are coming into the land of the Canaanites. God says to them, verse 2, When the Lord your God shall deliver these Canaanites to you, you shall defeat them, and you shall utterly destroy them, and you shall make no covenant with them and show no favor to them. Whatever happened to love your enemies? Well, I don't get it. Then in Joshua 6, the people of God actually do what they were told to do back in Deuteronomy 7, and when they do it, they do it brutally. so what's up with that? how do we reconcile this theme we've been on for a couple of weeks now power under with this power over theme that seems to be the general theme of the Old Testament some say actually that you can't reconcile these things indeed a one second century writer named Marcion citing what he saw as the irreconcilable differences between the loving God that is revealed in Christ in the New Testament and the angry, violent God that's revealed in the Old Testament suggested that what we actually should do is simply remove all the angry God references in the Old Testament from Scripture all together. Which actually would solve the problem. But it's not a solution I'm real wild about. And some of you might frown on that as well. Like, where do you stop? All the ones I don't like? Okay. What most of us actually do around this is just ignore it. Actually, I think, actually what we do is we come up with, I think unconsciously, what I would call a split view of the Old Testament and the New Testament that ultimately results in almost a split view of God himself, where the God of the Old Testament in our mind, again, we're not entirely conscious of this, but the God of the Old Testament in our mind is kind of crabby, you know, and he was kind of in a bad mood, and maybe he got therapy between the Old Testament and the New Testament. But the Old Testament, in our minds, the impression we have, it's all about law and judgment. It's thunder and lightning. While the God of the New Testament, as revealed to us in Christ, is all about mercy, grace, love, and forgiveness, as if in the Old Testament, there is no mercy, grace, love, or forgiveness. And in the New Testament, there's no judgment or law, none of which is true. Now, there's a number of reasons, actually, that I want to deal with this question about this apparent contradiction between the Old and the New Testaments. First, it's just a good question. But number two has to deal with how we've been coming to know Jesus as our rabbi, particularly in the context of history. And part of that history that I want us to dial into today that will help us begin to answer this question is to keep in mind something we've mentioned several times in the course of this rabbi study, that Jesus himself was a Torah-observant Jew. I mean, I said it a few weeks ago, and I know it was a little, but it was like Jesus wasn't a Christian. He was a Torah-observant Jew, which means, among other things, that his entire frame of reference in his humanity was the Old Testament. The Old Testament was his Bible. So he grew up hearing the stories. Indeed, committing to memory the stories. Remember as a young boy, we got into the educational system in Israel when Jesus was a child. And we assumed, because he lived there, that as a young boy, he was in Beth Sefer and then went to Beth Talmud. Memorizing the stories, not of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. He never heard of Paul. about the stories of Moses and the prophets. As a little boy in Bethsephor, Beth-Talmuth, he memorized Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea. And woven into all of those books of the Bible was the story of God and his dealings and sometimes his wrestlings with his people. But what's important to note was that the God Jesus came to know in the Old Testament, even as a child, was the God that as an adult, Jesus, came to call Abba, Father. At least in part because Jesus knew the story that revealed God and the heart of God in the Old Testament, the God of immeasurable love, who you could call Abba. So let me try today to tell you the story of the whole Old Testament. We've actually sent an email to everybody who comes to the second service. Admittedly, this is going to be a flyover, but I want you to get a taste, especially as it relates to this issue of power over and power under, of the story that Jesus lived in, that shaped and formed. And the reason, among others, that I think this is important is not only because this overview is going to help us answer the question I just raised, but also because this story, this understanding of Jesus' frame of reference relative to the Old Testament will help us further understand our rabbi's message. Because the message is right in context with the story of the Old Testament that he knew and lived in. It will help us understand his mission, and it will help us understand his method of power under. So let's just go back to the beginning. And in the beginning, what I want you to take note of relative to biblical history is the very first mention or episode of violence, power over, to get what you want of any kind does not happen until after the fall. which is significant. It wasn't until sin entered in and Cain killed Abel that we have any mention at all of violence at all, which tells you right off the bat that violence was not part of God's desire. It was not at all part of his character, which is, by the way, and it's important to note at the beginning, in contrast to virtually every other religion in ancient Israel's day, Indeed, before even Israel was called as the people of God, there were other gods who had real power. And these other gods were initiators of violence. They were violent by nature. It was their desire to destroy. It was their intent. Now, when I refer to their gods or other gods, know this. That their gods were real gods. And they had real power to do real damage, ultimately desiring to bring the souls of men and women into ruin. Even the souls of those devoted to them. Their evangelistic slogan, the gods of this world whose desire, born of satanic power, I believe, to steal, kill, and destroy. Even those who were devoted to them, their evangelistic slogan would have been, Your God hates you and has a horrible plan for your life. there's a movie in the theaters right now called 300 some of you have seen it some of you haven't you don't have to see it trust me but the word 300 is about 300 spartans that took this amazing stand in history against the hordes the massive army of persia and it was interesting because it featured the persian god king god king xerxes and as i was just reflecting on some of the things we've been saying in our series of how there were gods in Jesus' day. Caesar was God, and Caesar is Lord, and he was called King of Kings. In this film, they called Xerxes the King of Kings, but this God-King in the movie actually was an incredible visual because he embodied this desire to ruin the souls of men, even those devoted to him. See, here's the picture I want you to get. While in different cultures, at different times in history, these gods go by different names, Xerxes, Molech, Baal. There was another one called Mat in the Old Testament. They all came to, and they all emanated from one entity, one source, the god of this world, the enemy of men's souls. Satan himself is behind that very real power in the world whose primary task and deepest desire, it gives him joy to steal and kill and destroy. It is his nature from the beginning. It is not God's nature nor his desire ever. And that is why in the flow of the story of Scripture, No violence occurs till the deceiver deceives, till the defiler defiles what God has made good. Sin enters in. First thing that happens, Cain kills Abel, Genesis 4. So that from that moment on in biblical history, the primary indicator of the fallenness of man in Scripture is many things, but primarily it's violence. It's one of the reasons the Old Testament is such a violent book. Genesis 6, in the days of Noah, it says the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the primary manifestation of that corruption was that it was full of violence, says the text. So God, looking at this very early on, says, in effect, something that disturbs us because this looks like power over. I'm starting over. I'm starting over, and he starts over with Noah and dialing, Because sometimes even a God of love says enough. I want you to keep that in mind because I'm going to come back to that later in the story. But this pattern of violence, even after Noah, the flood, begins again with Noah. The pattern of violence doesn't change. In fact, if we're ever going to understand the Old Testament world and why God does what he does in the Old Testament, these things that sometimes disturb us, we have to understand, and it's hard to get our head around this, we have to understand the extent to which life in those times was dominated by violence and war. It was a culture of war. Just a tiny example of this that gives you some sort of flavor. 2 Samuel 11, verse 1. It's a story of David and Bathsheba, a story we're very familiar with, but it's introduced quite matter-of-factly with these words, 2 Samuel 11 verse 1. It was in the spring, you know, when kings go off to war. You know, we live in Minnesota, so we have the seasons, and it's almost spring, and so we're kind of, at least I am, I'm kind of dialed into the signs of spring. You know, it was in the spring when the twins go to Florida to train. It was in, you know, a sure sign of spring, sure sign of spring is that it's warm enough to start killing again. In the spring when kings go off to war, it's just the way life was. It's who they were, it's what they did, it's how they lived, and the fact is that there are places in the world right now, you know this is true, that are exactly that way even now. All I have to do to dial into that is read the paper. Some time ago I remember seeing a picture in the paper of a smiling man, toothless grin, holding a bloody axe, boasting that he had decapitated 1,300 people. Infidels, he called them. And while things like that shock and horrify us, and they should, life in ancient Israel was just that way. And you just read the book. It's everywhere. Which leads to this observation, important. We need to grasp to get a picture of the God Jesus knew through the story of the Old Testament. That war was one of the unfortunate and evil realities. It just was. Much like slavery. It didn't mean that slavery was good, but it just was. Polygamy, same way. Concubines, same way. That was the reality of life. Into which Israel was born. from which Israel was being called by God to become a different kind of people, to be a light in the middle of this awful darkness. So by this time in human history, it is what God has to work with, this culture of war. As he's beginning to call Israel out, this is where he had to start as he began to call his lost creation, and he's always doing this. I'm going to get into this a little bit more, even in two more weeks, to call his lost creation back to himself, to somehow redeem this thing. He was starting with this violent mess. So what's the plan to change all this? Well, here's the plan, in short, to call out a people of his own, to make a people of his own possession, to form with them a nation. The promise goes back to Abraham. This plan goes back to that. And then to take those people, call them out, and empower them to become the light of the world, the hope of the world, and then to move one step at a time, out of darkness into light, all the way to Jesus, who would culminate this thing by showing the human race a whole different way, a better way, a kingdom of God way, all of which leads to another observation that I think we need to know to get this picture clear, that the wars we read about, as particularly the ones commanded by God, where God says, go do this, like the one I read about in Deuteronomy 7 and Joshua 6, were all expressions of his judgment, his saying, enough, I want you to stop, To the evil that was destroying the creation that he had not only created, but the creation that he loved. An evil that was embodied at the time, in the Old Testament time, the Joshua Exodus time. It was embodied, this evil was, in what's known as the Canaanite culture, in ways that defy description. But let me try to describe the evil of the Canaanites. And again, this is just a touch, a taste. First, Canaan was the center of Baal worship. Baal worship is something we've dealt with in the past in detail. I'm not going to go into it here. But just suffice it to say that worship of Baal resulted in the dehumanizing of people, particularly the dehumanizing of women. They also worshiped a god called Molech. You can read of him in Leviticus chapter 18, who demanded, among other things, of them human sacrifice to prove their devotion. There you get, again, a picture of a God of this world who is embodied in some human being or some human system, but the power of Satan is behind him so that even devotees of this particular God are going to be destroyed. This is my desire to destroy you. So human sacrifice, in fact, particularly to Molech, they were asked for children. the firstborn child, which kind of spins my head around because I go back into the Old Testament and there were offerings sometimes brought to God. They were called the firstfruits, but it was grain. And you would bring the firstfruit of the harvest and offer it to God. And it was an act of faith that as God had provided, you give the best you have to God and he will provide the rest. In this particular Canaanite culture, the firstfruit was the fruit of your womb. and you take this precious little child, and they would sacrifice it to this awful deity, satanically empowered. But I don't care what I say. I don't think we can imagine what it felt like to live in Canaan under this kind of rule, where it actually felt like to grow up there, to be a little girl in Canaan, or a little boy, or a husband, or a wife. So let me explain with a more contemporary example. Consider Nazi Germany with me as being a place that maybe just begins to approach what Genesis 15, 16 calls the full measure of the Canaanites' sin. The full, and we explained that even, the full measure, it's weird because even in the judgment that God brings, he's patient because he's not willing that any should perish. And the full measure of sin was, why aren't you doing something here? They haven't reached the full measure of sin. There's still a chance. There's still a chance that they could come, that they could be redeemed. But then the full measure comes, and it's enough. Okay. One instance, one child, is written by historian Philip Friedman and then quoted, and this is where I found it, in Greg Boyd's book called God at War. It's an eyewitness account of what happened to one Jewish girl living in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Nazi occupation. Zosia was a little girl, the daughter of a well-respected physician. During an action, one of the German soldiers became aware of her beautiful diamond-like dark eyes. I could make two rings out of them, he said. One for myself and one for my wife. His colleague is holding the girl. Let's see whether they are really so beautiful. Better yet, let's examine them in our hands. One soldier then proposes to take the eyes out. What happens next is that the fainting child is lying on the floor. Instead of eyes, two bloody wounds are staring. The mother, driven mad, is held by the woman. Later, both are executed, being now deemed by the Nazis useless to them. Now, with that story in mind, as horrible as it is, multiply it and add it to another child after another, after another, after another generation, after generation, after generation. And you begin, you begin to get a glimpse of Canaan and what it means for a culture to reach the full measure of sin. And when you do, the question changes from how could a loving God bring the kind of judgment we see in the Old Testament to how on earth could he wait so long? Well, in Deuteronomy 6, God says, I'm not waiting any longer. Enough. In Joshua 7, God says, enough. We need to know. We really need to dial into this. And it's not just in the Old Testament. It's in the new as well. There are times when this God, whose name is love, says enough. In fact, we need to dial into this fact, I think, that there are times we are called to say enough ourselves, to say it's time to stop. When you see abuse, when there is injustice, God from time to time will call us to say, you know what? Enough in protection of those who can't protect themselves. When you do that, you're living in the story. It's not just the Old Testament. This is the story of God. A little more complex. Sometimes we'd like it to be. Sometimes God says enough. In fact, at the end of the age, God is going to ultimately say enough. But then another problem arises. As God is calling Israel to himself and is beginning to use Israel for his purposes, And among others, his purpose is to deal with the kind of evil you see in Canaan by bringing judgment through them. Something happens that isn't good. Israel actually begins to enjoy it. Particularly, they begin to enjoy the war. Let me give you an example of that. Joshua 7. After their victory at Jericho, they lose the battle of Ai. A-I is how that's spelled. And part of the thing that's noticeable about losing that battle was an easily defeatable foe. And the reason they lost the battle, if you read the story, is because of a man named Achan, who, according to Joshua 7, verse 1, had acted unfaithfully in regard to things under the ban, which simply means this. He took some things after the battle at Jericho that God told them not to take. They were banned. And he hid them in his tent. Which, you know, when you first read it, you go, yeah, that's a bad thing, but it doesn't sound like that big a deal. Well, let me explain the ban and the reason for it. And it even kind of speaks to how God was dealing with these people, calling them at a very infantile stage of the story to himself. The reason for the ban. In most armies in that day, in Joshua's day, the way the soldiers got paid was by defeating their enemies and taking their possessions. So they were kind of working on commission. And some of the soldiers got rich that way. Creating a kind of addiction to war. A love for war. Because it was so lucrative. Thus, the ban, prohibiting Israel from taking possessions of a defeated foe for personal gain, as if to say, God is speaking to his people saying, listen, there are times I'm going to use you to say enough, but here's the deal, I do not want you to ever start enjoying this, benefiting from this in ways that aren't appropriate. I don't want you to ever start enjoying war, but they do. In fact, by chapter 9 of Joshua, instead of being this called out people who were designed by God to become the light of the world, instead of being called out, they are led to, by Joshua 9, the worship of Baal. And that ensues another one of those wrestling matches between God and his people. Come back to me. Moving the tape forward, the movie, the story, the era of the judges, which follows right on the heels of Joshua, isn't much better. Where judges ruled the land of Israel, it's a very up and down period of time. According to Judges 13, verse 1, during the time of the judges, they had a 40-year period of time where they were in bondage to the Philistines. 40 years in bondage to the Philistines. That 40-year thing sounds familiar. During the judges, they had some good ones. They had some bad ones. Gideon was noble and good. Samson was a mess, a major disappointment. We've talked of him before, how God had anointed him and empowered him to be a deliverer, a Moses-like person for his people. But it was all about him, and it just created an amazing mess. So the people began at near the end of the judges to cry for a king. We want a king. If we only had a king. Samuel, the prophet, warns them about that in 1 Samuel 8. A God will give you a king. We can provide a king, but I just need to tell you that if you have a king, he'll make your sons soldiers and he'll march them in front of his chariots for war. We don't care, said the people of God. We want a king who will lead us into battle, culture of war. It was all they knew. It was the only way they knew it, to get what they wanted to get. We want a king to lead us in battle so we can be powerful again, so they get what they want. As this story of God and his people progresses, the first king they get is a person named Abimelech, one of the sons of Gideon. Gideon had 70 sons, which means he was doing more than fighting. Mercy. These guys took real serious that be fruitful and multiply thing. Abimelech becomes the first king, and he gets things started in ways that are consistent with how he knows how to do things, how to get power and control. He kills all 70 of his brothers. Well, we're off on the right foot, aren't we? The heir of the kings. I'll give you what you want. It'll be, they'll put your sons in front of chariots. But then come the glory days. Everyone in Israel considered what was about to happen, the glory days. It started with Saul, but then David. David, ah, in the line of David is what you want to be. Then Solomon. But even there, there's violence between Saul and David. You know the stories involved there. Then David and his sons till soon after Solomon. And again, in Scripture, it's many, many years, but in the scheme of the story. Very short period of time when Solomon is done, by the end of his reign, the kingdom is divided into the northern and the southern kingdoms. And soon after that, the northern kingdom is defeated and enslaved by the Assyrians. The southern kingdom is defeated and enslaved by the Babylonians, which means, among other things, that the people of God are back where they started. Let me just think of this. This amazing story. Jesus memorized these stories, knew them, and knew the God behind them. Back where they started in subjugation to another power. Not Egypt this time, now it's Assyria and Babylon. Thus raising this question, a question that was raised from time to time. In the story, does the covenant, God, that you were wanting to make with us still hold? Are the promises for us as a people still true? Some, to be sure, continued to keep the dream alive of a kingdom and hoped for a return of the glory days because that was the only frame of reference they had for how it would look when the kingdom would come. They dreamt of the days of deliverance and conquest. Two key words. That was what was in their hearts. Deliverance and conquest. But for most of them, the fulfillment of that dream could only be imagined in a conquest way. They could only visualize this happening, this kingdom being realized in their actual lives through raw, physical, military power over. So give us again, this was their desire, give us again a deliverer like Moses, a warrior like Joshua, a king like David. That's all they could conceive. But then, something began to stir. And like a lot of things that stir at the beginning, it would be very easy to not even notice it when it began to stir because it began like a mustard seed, very, very tiny. Most notably, it stirred first among the prophets, as is often the case among the first of the prophets, that this thing began to stir in was Jeremiah, who began to get by revelation a new and better vision, something that no human being, as this story had unfolded for millennia, had ever conceived before. For what began to dawn on him through revelation was this, that what Israel and the world needed, was not just another shot at the old way, was not the capacity to wage war with greater force, with better weapons and bigger armies. What he began to conceive of, that nobody in Jeremiah's day was buying at all. Remember, Jeremiah was the weeping prophet for among other reasons. No one listened to him. The picture he had was this, that what the world needed and Israel needed was a whole new kind of person. And this is what he saw, and this is what he, Jeremiah, said. Jeremiah 31, verse 31. Behold, days are coming, declares the Lord. I know you can't see them right now, but they are coming when I will make a new covenant. I will create a new way with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them declares the Lord and in a couple weeks we're going to talk about that wrestling match of God wrestling with his wife come back, come back but this is the covenant this new way which I will make with the house of Israel after those days declares the Lord I will put my laws within them not just on tablets of stone I'm going to put them inside of them and on their heart I will write these words of life and I will be their God and they shall be my people This is the dream of God. This is the heart of God. This is the God that Jesus knew through memorizing the prophet Jeremiah. And they shall not teach again each man, his neighbor, each man, his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for they will know the Lord. From the least of these to the greatest, declares the Lord, for I will forgive their iniquity and their sin and remember it no more and draw them back as a bride to the groom. And then came another prophet. His name was Zechariah. And this is what he saw. And this is what he said. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion. Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem. Behold, your king is coming. David, David, wait. He is just and endowed with salvation, with deliverance. Humble and mounted on a donkey. And all God's people said, oh, what? That's worse. Even the colt of a donkey. I don't want that. That'll never work. And this king coming on the colt of a donkey will be good news for the poor and the oppressed. You know why? He will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem and the bow of war will be cut off and he will speak peace to the nations and his dominion will be from sea to sea and from river to the ends of the earth. But all of that in the hearts and minds of the people who first heard this prophet speak these strange words would raise a question. What kind of king rides into the occupied city of Jerusalem which he mentions in verse 9 on the coat of a donkey. It'll never work. It's just ridiculous. I mean, even in your mind, I don't know if you can do it, but picture the violence. Remember when we talked a few weeks ago about the violence of Rome? It's just so overwhelming. And people under the foot of that violence felt so small. Are they going to be encouraged by some guy walking in on a donkey's baby? Give me more than this. but one king did this very thing and when he did he knew exactly what he was doing you know I get it it cracks me up when people talk about how Jesus fulfilled these prophecies as if Jesus had the list of the Old Testament going okay did that and he checks off I gotta ride in and juice him on a donkey okay check that out Jesus did know the Old Testament and he knew how the people of God thought and he understood symbolism and he understood the symbol. He understood completely what he was doing when he rode into Jerusalem in the foal of a donkey for he had come to bring a different way. He had come to take away the chariots of Ephraim, verse 10 of Zechariah's prophecy and the war horses from Jerusalem to break the bow of battle and he came preaching peace. You see, it took this long in human history for at least a few and beloved promise. It was only a few and I got bad news. It's still only a few who would understand that the old way did not and would never work. That violence and force which seemed in Jesus' day and all through the Old Testament to be the strongest force on earth and still today seems to be the strongest force on earth. If you want to get something done, do it this way, that that kind of power over was not nearly strong enough to usher in God's kingdom or to transform the human heart. It would take a king riding on a donkey, a king who would disarm and defeat a culture of death, not by taking anyone's life, but by giving his own away and then inviting his followers to do the same. Not by killing the infidels, but by dying for them. Are you kidding? Not with the power of the sword, but with what came to be known as the power of the cross. And a few, a very few, were ready to listen. And part of why they were ready to listen was because they'd seen what the culture of war did, what the power of, we're tired, we're so tired. It just doesn't work. And this feels, I don't know, started so small. Just a handful of people sitting on a hillside in Galilee. Picture that, Matthew 5. The disciples are there. And as they listened to him, they noticed what he said, but they noticed as much what he didn't say. Because he didn't say, blessed are the warriors and the conquerors. Blessed are the powerful and the strong. He said, blessed what? He said, blessed are the poor in spirit. Blessed are the peacemakers. And while others have told you to love your neighbor and hate your enemy, I say, love your enemy. and pray for those who spitefully use you. For now at last it will be clear that the people of God, the light of the world, will not be a political nation wielding political or military power armed with swords and chariots, slogans and power plays, but a people will they be armed with not much more than love and prayer. How pathetic. It'll never work. Eager to serve, ready to endure suffering if need be, so that the lights might go on for those who are still in darkness. But when they heard this, man, they had been so amazed when he spoke with authority and demonstrated power. But when they heard this, many withdrew. And we're not walking with him anymore. Indeed, that is at least part of why when Jesus rode in that day on the colt of a donkey into Jerusalem, it says in Luke 19.41 that he wept. You know, it's so weird. Everybody else is going, Hosanna, Hosanna, and he's weeping. You know why? Because he knew they didn't get it. They didn't get it at all. In fact, he says in Luke 19, 42, if you had only known the things which make for peace, even as you're screaming here, Hosanna, Hosanna, you don't have a clue what makes for peace because it's not power over, it's power under, but they didn't know. For these ways, verse 42 says, for these ways, these power under ways were hidden from their eyes. and it wasn't that it was some sort of mystery. It was simply that they'd never seen anybody do it that way. So Jesus did it. So Jesus, you know, weeping in Jerusalem, you don't know the things that make for peace. You still think it's power over. The only way you're ever going to get this is if I show you. and he goes to the cross. The cross, where symbolically you have the worst that man and hell can do to inflict on another human being pain, humiliation, and death. But this time in the cross, and the only reason there's hope is because of the resurrection. A few weeks away, we'll have fun with that one. This time when Jesus, not as a victim, but says, I am going to choose this to show you a better way. This time when this thing designed for humiliation and death, for the first time it was not met. This humiliation and death was not being met with more humiliation and death with curses and you're going to get it in the end. But as he stood on the cross, he said, Father, forgive them. And to the thief next to them, he said, today you'll be with me. So it was met with forgiveness and generosity, inclusion, and grace. And when he was doing that, he was literally, for the first time in history, overcoming evil, not with more evil, but he was pushing back the evil with good. He was pushing back a culture of death by him giving his own life away, not taking anyone else's. Whatever else that means, I've said it before, it means this, love wins. In the end, love wins, but love isn't much. Sometimes love says enough, you have to stop. But many, upon hearing this, withdrew from him. And we're not walking with him anymore because they just didn't believe that this way was the way. It'll just never work. so what do you believe it's interesting this series is changing even more when I think of do you believe in Jesus because my whole life it only meant do you believe that Jesus died and rose again and if you believe in that you go to heaven when you die I still believe that's true and you need to believe that but I think a lot of people who believe Jesus died on the cross for their sins so they can go to heaven when they die don't believe a word of this so where are you in the story let me close with a story Stephan Van Voorst told me this story some time ago we were with a group of people and he added this to the conversation about a friend of his working with Arabs in Amman, Jordan when he was asked, this friend of Stephan's was asked a question by a Muslim woman in the group she was quite troubled by what she saw in her world even in her neighborhood how do we stop, she said, this cycle of violence because it just is never ending The Sunnis and the Shiites, it's just constant more, and violence is met with more violence. How do you break the cycle? She was kind of in despair. This Western Christian man said to her, wanting to be very careful to not just give silly, trite answers, I don't know, but I have a story. So he told a story, the story of a man named John Vanier. John Vanier was the mentor of Henry Nouwen. John Vanier is a great man in the kingdom of God. He physically had great stature. He was like a six foot six and that size of his does tile into the story. He had a physical and a spiritual presence about him. John Vanier had been working with the destitutes, the horribly poor in rural France. But he was doing it at a home in this very poverty stricken area. or disabled and mentally challenged adults. Now, because he was working with this group of people in this compound for disabled and mentally challenged people, the government was subsidizing this thing. So this compound of his had a number of amenities that the poor in the community did not, like running water and indoor plumbing and doors that actually locked. One day, Vanier was outside of the compound when he was confronted by a very angry man with some size himself. And what he was angry about was the fact that he and the people in the community had nothing but these blankety blanks, is what the guy said of them in the compound, these disabled ones, were getting things, and I'd like to go in there and give them some real disability, is what he said. Not knowing what to say or do, but seeing very clearly his rage and feeling like he needed somehow to protect those inside, he said to the man, do you want to hit me? It didn't take long for him to get his answer, because he did, evidently, and just hauled off and belted him right in the face. John Vanier, big man, fell back, fell down, stunned, staggered, didn't know what to do, still actually was even more confused about what to do or say, got to his feet, and said, do you want to hit me again? Which is not something I necessarily recommend. But now the attacker was confused. A bit disarmed, he strangely, but it was very subtle at first, softened. His rage turned to grief and then remorse, and he began to weep. It fell to his knees, and the pain that was behind the anger began to flow. So the friend of Stephan's who was talking to the Muslim woman telling the story said, I don't know how to stop the cycle of violence. But what if that's one way? Maybe the cycle of violence could be broken. If someone who didn't deserve violence and has the strength to bear the violence would absorb it for those disabled ones in the compound. But who would ever do a thing like that? let's pray let's pray Holy Spirit come Lord in this quiet moment this quiet place we know the one who would do something just like that the one we now call Rabbi who is calling us to do the same. So this I pray. For eyes to see and ears to hear. For hands that help and feet that follow. The one that we are coming to know as our Rabbi, Jesus. And all God's people said, amen.
