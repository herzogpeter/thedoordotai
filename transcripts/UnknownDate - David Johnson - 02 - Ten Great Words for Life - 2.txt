Open your Bibles with me to Exodus chapter 20, where we enter today, the second week of examining a section of Scripture we've come to know as the Ten Commandments, the Decalogue. Deca meaning ten, log, or logos meaning word or words. We've come to call them the ten great words from God for life. Last week in this, I am trying to lay what I think is a vital foundation for clear understanding and appropriate application before we actually get to the words one by one. Critical to that foundation is understanding, first of all, that the ten great words for life were delivered in Exodus chapter 20 to already redeemed, purchased by the blood of the Lamb people. These words in Exodus 20 were never designed by God as a means by which people could be redeemed, delivered, or healed. Chapter 20, verse 2 makes that clear at the outset when it says this, I am the Lord, your God, who already has brought you up and out of Egypt. They were already redeemed by the blood. They were already delivered through the Red Sea. They had already had their bitter water turned sweet. That means they had already been experiencing healing. And they were already experiencing the bread of life, manna and water. The intent of the 10 great words we established last week was to show already redeemed people how to continually live in the freedom and deliverance that God had already provided for them. It's as if to say this. You want to stay free and not be subject again to a yoke of slavery, to sin like you were in Egypt? Here's how. My paraphrase. We're going to put it up on the board again. The ten great words for life. Put God first. Accept no substitutes. Revere God's name. Observe his day. Respect your parents. Don't kill human beings. Limit sex to marriage. Don't steal. Don't lie. Don't enviously desire what doesn't belong to you. Calvin and Hobbes is a cartoon strip that appears daily in newspapers all across the country. Calvin is the main character, 7 or 8-year-old boy. Hobbes is his imaginary friend who is, in reality, a stuffed tiger. And Calvin, if you know the comic strip, imagines Hobbes to be alive, and they talk and they walk and they play and they argue with each other. In one particular comic strip episode that actually I saw in a book of Calvin and Hobbes comics, Calvin appears to be drawing something, and he's frustrated while he's doing it. Hobbes, this imaginary tiger friend, leans in and asks Calvin, well, what are you doing? Well, I'm drawing a picture, but it's not turning out, Calvin says. It says here that if you connect these dots, you'll make a picture. And I don't see a picture. Hobbes, exasperated, says, well, you just made a mess. It doesn't work that way. It only works if you connect the dots in sequence by the numbers. Calvin, really frustrated now, crumples up the paper in a ball, throws it in the garbage and angrily exclaims, Rules! Rules! Rules! The problem is the rules. They're bad, restrictive, limiting. They're not friendly at all. Last week, we noted that there are people who look at the ten great words for life, the ten commandments, the way Calvin looked at the numbers and the dots, as if God got up grumpy one day, just decided to make life as miserable and restrictive as possible, so that fundamentally what we have in the ten great words are just this, rolls, rolls, rolls. What we discovered, however, was that much like the point of that cartoon, these parameters and restrictions were given with our greatest good in mind, boundaries and directions that would enable, specifically, the already redeemed people of God, to paint a beautiful picture with their life, to live a fulfilling life, indeed a kingdom life. Jeremiah 29, 11. We hear the heart of God who says, I know the plans I have for you. They're really good plans, plans for good and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Here's how to walk in those plans. Here's how to, all your life long, realize those plans. Put me first. Accept no substitutes. Revere my name. Observe my day. Last week, one of the things I asked you to do was to with me dream about what it would feel like to be in a community of already redeemed people where these ten great words were more than lofty precepts, but they were being, by the living Spirit of God within each one of us, authentically lived out. Not in some legalistic external way, but to be with a group of redeemed people who from the heart did indeed love the Lord their God with all their heart, all their soul, and all their mind. And out of that there came love for their neighbor as themselves. Well, the fact is this. What that would feel like, we said, was heaven. In fact, it would feel like the kingdom of heaven. And in fact, when we consider the ten great words of God being delivered to already redeemed people, What these words are, are an invitation into the fullness of kingdom living. A description of kingdom living. And they reveal both the heart and the purpose of God for his people. For he is not just satisfied to redeem us, deliver, heal, and provide for us. He wants to fulfill us. To bring us to the fullness of our destiny as a kingdom of priests. as a truly holy nation, as His special treasure, as His prized possession, till Christ be fully formed in you to be a people who are learning to do right now, in their living, what we will do for eternity, and that is this, to rule and reign with Him forever. The ten great words from God for life call us to that kind of kingdom living now. Now. That's all review. as exciting as that concept of what these words are intended to call us to is to me it all raises questions for me and and there may be some questions that you left with last sunday and i certainly did as well and and there are questions that some uh have some fear to them there's some frightening questions involved among the questions are these what if you're not redeemed now I set this whole thing up by saying that these words were originally spoken to people who already were redeemed already were delivered calling them to the fullness of their kingdom life but what if you're not redeemed what is your relationship to the law then and it's to you second question what if you're trying to use the law in a way that it was never intended by God to be used and that is as a means by which you attempt to justify yourself in other words you so you don't commit adultery, and you believe that by virtue of the fact that you don't commit adultery, you can by that be justified, and you're using the law to justify yourself. Well, what's your relationship with the law then? And it's to you. Third question. What if you really love Jesus? In fact, honestly, when you get to your heart of hearts, you really even love the law. You look at the ten great words and you say, I really want those things to be really lived out in my life. But you're really in a Romans 7 kind of place in terms of your living. What do you mean by that, Dave? Romans 7, 22. The apostle Paul, of all people, says this. I joyfully concur with the law of God in my inner person. I look at these 10 great words and I think, that is what I want. But in the outer man and in my flesh, rather, I find myself failing all the time. The very thing I don't want to do, I do. The thing I want to do, I don't do. Here's my question. What's that person's relationship to the law? And it to you? When you're in a Roman 7 kind of place. See, if you're in a Roman 7 kind of place and you really even are redeemed, one of the things I can probably tell you about yourself is that as we go into this study of the law, you feel like a total hypocrite, completely unworthy, And there will be times, if you don't understand some of the things we need to talk about today, that you're going to feel like, I just need to bail on this whole thing, because I'm obviously not measuring up. Well, those questions that I had in my mind when I left last Sunday, and others as well, made it obvious to me that we needed to do some more foundation laying this week. It's kind of part two of last week, before we even get into the specific words. For before the law of God can function in your life as that which legitimately calls you into the fullness of kingdom life, it needs to accomplish a prior purpose. For before the law of God can call you the way we're talking about right now, first of all, it has to kill you. What a weird thing to say. What an odd thing to hear from a preacher. The law, if it's going to call you to the depths of kingdom life, first of all, has to kill you. Continuing today to lay foundation for understanding so we can fully enter into these ten great words, I need to share with you this morning four purposes of the law. We have been dealing thus far with the fourth purpose. It's odd to start with the fourth purpose first. To fully apply it rightly, I need to give you the other three, and then the fourth. So this morning, four purposes of the law. The first is this. Wipe away what we've talked about so far. Understand this, that the first purpose of the law doesn't call you. It kills you, for the first purpose of the law is to reveal sin. Turn in your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 7. Romans, the seventh chapter. We hear from Paul speak to this very issue and to this very point of the purpose of the law in what I think is a powerful, very clear, though not easy to sort out way. I'm going to do my best to help you with it. Romans 7, verses 7 to 11. Paul says this. What shall we say then? Is the law sin? May it never be. On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the law. The law did what? he's saying. Made me know sin. It means the purpose of the law is to reveal sin. For I would not have known about coveting if the law had said, you shall not covet. So the purpose of the law, Paul is saying, is to make me aware that covetousness is sin. It reveals sin. But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind. For apart from the law, sin is dead. Stop right there. Confusing what he's saying there. What he's saying there is not this. He's not saying that the commandment to not covet stirred up in me covetousness. It made covetousness come. Now, Paul had all sorts of covetousness, just like you do, and just like, he had all sorts of covetousness. But before he knew that covetousness was sin, the reality of covetousness as sin was dead to him. When the law said, Paul, by the way, when you do that, and when you feel that, and when you move that way, what that is is covetousness. The sin of covetousness came alive in him. You understand? Because the light went on and revealed that it came alive. The reality of sin came alive. I was once alive apart from the law. I had a good life. I felt really good about what I was doing. Felt like a pretty good guy. I told the law, and the law told me, you're not doing that great, buddy. My weird paraphrase, but when, see, the commandment came, sin became alive. It's not like I started sinning. It just made me aware of all the sin. My awareness of sin came alive, and I died. and this commandment which was to result in life proved to result in death for me for sin taking opportunity through the commandment deceived me and through it killed me. First purpose of the law is not to call you it's to kill you. I tried to explain that as I went through there hopefully some of the things came together I want to do it again and just give you my paraphrase my paraphrase of what Paul just said there is this is the law bad on the contrary it saved my life it did me a favor what was the favor the favor was this that it made me realize I had a problem that I did not see it broke through my delusion that everything was fine in my life you see I would not have ever come to see sin in me except through the law so it helped me see what I was blind to I would not have known about coveting if the law had not said thou shalt not covet but that awareness was not a pleasant experience for me. In fact, when the light went on and I saw my sin, it killed me. Verse 9. I used to feel great about my life apart from the law. I was alive. I felt great. I was just doing my life, really living. But then the law came and made sin alive, made me aware of the sin, made me aware to that, and when that happened, I died. That's not as odd or bizarre as you might think. Let me just ask you this question. See, I think every one of you have tasted this I died thing at one time or another. Have you ever felt conviction for sin? Have you ever felt that? You got past your denial. Something penetrated your rationalization. Something penetrated your ability to blame everybody else and got down to where, like somebody pinned against a wall, You couldn't get away from that thing you did or said was sin. And there is a piece of conviction that feels like I'm going to what? Die. I hate it. Now, walking through that, there comes some life. But the experience of conviction, when the light of the law comes on, and I see what I have done as sin, the feeling of that is not a good feeling on the front end. This commandment, verse 10, which eventually was to result in life in me because it was going to usher me into grace and freedom even from the sin, at the beginning, he's saying, verse 10, proved to be death in me. It killed me. Verse 11. Why? Because it revealed or brought to life deadly sin I did not even know existed in me. And in coming alive to sin in me, I died. That's the first purpose of the law, to reveal sin. Second purpose of the law is to produce brokenness. Past revealing sin, the purpose of the law, is to convince you that it's even worse than you have sin. Brokenness means you can't do anything about cleaning up your sin. This is really bad news on the front end. Let me tell it to you like this. The law of God is like a powerful, penetrating beam of light. and when that light goes on it exposes or it brings to life all sorts of junk in your life the bible calls it sin we'll call it junk garbage thou shalt not commit adultery and when the bible when the when the law says that it's like a light that shines on your adultery and the first thing i want to do is get all defensive you know unless you committed adultery then you just feel oh yes it's true but but i never committed adultery so i go well that's true preach the word we need some Morality in the culture. And the problem with the law is that the penetrating power of the law is it goes past what you just think in a broad way means adultery. For Jesus in Matthew 5 says, you've heard it said don't commit adultery. Let me tell you how adultery gets played out in a variety of ways. You haven't committed adultery, that's good. You want to talk about lust? Let's talk about lust. And all of us go, the light goes on that and it doesn't feel good and all of a sudden my adultery comes to life. It's not that I didn't have adultery. It was there all the time. When the law says, let's talk about lust, put a light on it. Thou shalt not kill. Preach it. Because I have never killed. I feel really good. I can't wait until you get that murder one. You going to do anything on capital punishment? Hope you do. Jesus said, you've heard it said, I shall not kill. I say, let's talk about your rage. Okay? I want to talk about your inner life. I want to talk about your inner life that maybe doesn't produce a bullet in somebody else's head, but you come out with words that literally kill the spirit of your children and your spouse. Want to talk about murder? Let's talk about your need to call people you fool. Legalists, That's all out of Matthew 5 when Jesus said, you don't commit murder. I say, don't even be angry. Say raka and call people fool. You fool. And legalists hear you fool and they say, okay, well, Jesus, I just have a question. You say not to say fool. What about idiot? Can I call him a jerk? I'll just, you know, legalists. These are the list of bad words you can't say. And Jesus says, you don't get it. that what I'm going for is your inner life and where your rage lives. For calling someone a fool is a term of despising. And I would like with words to despise your very life, you idiot. Might as well put a gun to their spirit. That's what the law does, puts a light on all that. Now, when the light of the law exposes whatever your junk is, and this light I think I've already at least begun to illustrate the penetrating ways it's going to go underneath what adultery really means and I'm not going to spend any more time because we're going to go into the deep things of what idolatry is and adultery is when we hit them once at a time when that light goes on you have some options in terms of what to do the most popular is this, to turn off the light just get rid of it altogether to disregard the law of God completely to embrace the spirit of the age which basically says there are no moral absolutes who's to say what's right and wrong to effectively thereby live in denial. It also helps, by the way, to get angry at the person who in your life may be turning on the light of the law for you, exposing sin in your life by confronting you. I am absolutely convinced that there are people in this service, just like last service and just like last night, who came to church last night and this morning, having no idea what I was going to talk about, but really angry at their spouse or their children or their friend or their boss or their employee or their counselor or their pastor who effectively only did this. Tell them the truth about their behavior. And what it did was it turned on a light. So one thing to do, when the law turns its light on you and exposes your sin, turn the light off. And it also helps, if you're trying to get out of this, to get real angry at the person who turned the light on. That's very helpful. It's one of your options. I'm being sarcastic. Yeah, you wouldn't believe it. Anyway. Paul, by the way, said he lived this way once. Romans 7, verse 9, he says this. I was once alive apart from the law. I had a great old life. I did what I wanted. I did whatever I felt, and nothing ever bothered me. It felt fine. You know why it felt fine? I never turned on the light. And when somebody did, I turned it off. Problem, by the way, with that approach is this, that there is a way that seemeth right unto a man. There is a way that feeleth good unto a person, but the end thereof is the way of death. And the death I'm talking here is eternal death. There's another thing you can do when the light of the law exposes your sin, and it's this. And this is the option that generally kind of pretty good people try and religious people try. Let's try to clean it up yourself. To try and clean it up yourself. To work really hard, to do the best you can, to convince yourself that you really are doing the best you can. And you know what? Doing the best you can is all that God expects anyway. Don't you love when you get on the talk show and these great theologians? Well, you know, I'm doing the best I can, and it's all God expects. What they need is a little clearer picture of what the law really says. We end up comparing ourselves to other people who actually have done a lot more than us. They've got a lot more dirt than we do. And we find ourselves saying things like this. Well, I may have done this, but they have done that. It's even a comfort. I encourage you, if you're really trying to go this way, to read the paper every day. and look at all the murders and the rapes, and if you do enough of that, you'll kind of start feeling much better by yourself. I did this, I did that, but I never did that. Picture it like this. You're in a room. It's a room of your own life. It's a room of your own heart. Nobody goes in there but you. Now, the people you live with have to live with the results of what's in that room, but really, it's your stuff. And you're in this room, and the light of the law comes on in there, And it reveals a pile of smelly, slimy goop. The way you decide to deal with this is to clean it up. So in this picture I have, I see myself or some of you trying to clean it up. And as you pick up the goop, it's running through your fingers. It's getting on your hands. It's covering your clothes. It smells really bad. It's getting in your hair. But you work really hard, and you clean it up. And when you clean it up, you feel really good. You know, I just saw that bad thing in my life, and I went there, and I just cleaned that thing right up. I went to the counselor, and he told me how, and I just did it really well. And, you know, I'm on the way home from my counselor. I look in the rearview mirror. I look at me. I go, you are a pretty good guy. Certainly better than, no, I don't know, the guy driving next to me. Road rage right there. Not me. I'm peaceful today. I thank you, God. I'm not like him. Stick with this picture I have of you being in a room of your heart where the light went on, you cleaned it all up. You cleaned it all up, you're feeling really good. It's off the floor, but you look really stupid. You know why? Because that stuff you cleaned up off the floor, it's all over you now. Remember I told you it was all slipping through your fingers and getting on you, clothes, it's in your hair, you smell like crazy. And in this goofy picture of mine, let's just say you recognize that. You know, I cleaned it up off the floor, this behavior out here that people see, but now it's on me. I'm going to go take a shower. And they say, you know, I just take a lot of liberty in my pictures I get. What would a shower be? I'm going to go to church this weekend. And I'm just going to bask in the worship, and it's just going to cleanse me. And I'm just going to feel so good. I went to counseling on Friday, cleaned up the mess. I'm going to go to church on Sunday. I'm going to wash it off of me. This is wonderful. So you do it. And you clean up the mess, and you take your proverbial shower, and after you do, the spotlight that started it all off moves. It just moves a little bit. And you know what it says? Missed a spot. I was waxing my car yesterday. I really enjoy doing that. I waxed my car, got a little nice, buffed it all. I step back, look at it. This is great. Bonnie, come here, look at this. Look at this, great. I walk away, I stop, take one more look. and in a different light, guess what I saw? Missed a spot. No, I was able to clean it up. But this law, light beam, doesn't just delight in frustrating the daylights out of me by moving it just a little bit and showing me how I missed a spot. But after I think I got that little place of my life, spick and span, the light goes to the corner of that room. Okay, I'll do that one too. And after I'm in the middle of cleaning that one up in the corner, it goes up to the ceiling and it shows me some cobwebs up there. Oh my goodness. I'll get to that next. I get up there, I'm starting to clean. Then it goes to the windowsill. I never get the windowsill. And after I get over to the windowsill, I'm just about done with the windowsill and the stupid spotlight goes back to the original pile of goop that's dirty again. I can't do this. Those are very important words. I can't do this. Because the second purpose of the law is to convince you that not only do you have sin, but you by yourself do not have the power to cleanse yourself of it. And that sets you up for the third purpose of the law. For the third purpose of the law is to drive us to Christ, who is our only hope for life. If you've been at Open Door for any length of time, you're familiar with this passage. It bears repeating, but I dare not presume that all of you know this. It's why I'm spending a week on this. Galatians 3, verse 23 and 24, speaks of this third purpose of the law that is absolutely critical for us to go through in order to enter into the glory of the fourth purpose. Third purpose is this, starting in verse 23. before faith came we were kept in custody under the law being shut up to faith which was later to be revealed therefore the law has become our tutor whose job it was to lead us to christ that we may be justified not by our ability to clean up the mess but by faith in his ability to clean up my mess the law has become our tutor tutor is a key word the greek word for tutor there is paedagogos, and when you understand what paedagogos actually means, it kind of makes you feel like tutor might not be the best translation of paedagogos. When I think of a tutor, I think of somebody sitting next to me and teaching me how to do math. The paedagogos in reality, in original Greek, was a person, often a slave, sometimes a servant, of a large landowner whose job it was, among other jobs to drive the children of this large landowner to school. By drive, I do not mean get them in the car and drive. By drive, I mean, like a herd of cattle, drive. And with a switch in hand, drive them to school. I don't know if kids were different then than they are now, but for instance, my kids, on a school day, wake up in the morning, and Christopher especially, when I go in to wake him up, he opens his eyes, he bounces out of bed, his eyes are wide open. He goes, Dad, is it a school day? I go, yes, son. Oh, thank the Lord. I want to learn. And he goes to school. Self-motivated. No, no, no, he doesn't. I have to drag him out and then drive him to school. And I drive him on the bus or in the car, but I drive him to. Get it? You get it. The purpose of the law is to reveal your sin, to produce a brokenness, recognize you can't do anything about your sin, and with a switch in hand, convince you over and over again, you can't do it yourself, you can't clean it up, you clean that mess up, I'll show you this mess. You think it's adultery? Let's talk about your lust. You dealt with your murder? Let's talk about your rage. Until you are driven, sometimes by nothing more noble than desperation to your only hope, which is Christ Jesus, an amazing grace. purpose of the law is to beat the living daylights out of you convincing you that your only hope for life cleansing redemption deliverance healing and transformation is christ alone verse 24 drives us to christ that we may be justified by faith faith in what faith in this that only christ available to me, alive in me, working through me, is able to redeem, deliver, heal, provide, transform, and regenerate me. Now that word is incredibly important. Regeneration, it is a word that we're not going to deal with in Exodus. It's not a word that applied to the people of Israel as they left the Exodus. They were redeemed, brought out of slavery. They were delivered through the Red Sea. they were healed, their bitter water turned sweet, but they did not experience what you and I, by the Spirit of God, because of the death and resurrection of Christ, are able to experience. And that is the miracle of recreation. Marvel not that I said to you, you must be born again by the Spirit of God. An inside job is what I'm talking about. The miracle of regeneration is the glory of the new covenant made possible by the precious blood of our Passover lamb, even Jesus, who is the Christ. Therefore, 2 Corinthians 5, 17, if any man is in Christ, he is not just brought out of slavery. He is not just delivered through the Red Sea. He does not just have his bitter water turn sweet. He is, she is a new creature. Someone who didn't exist 10 minutes ago exists now, a new creation. Old things are passed away. Behold, new things have come. A new creature with a new heart. And with a new heart implanted by the Spirit, there comes a new desire. A desire you didn't even care about before. You know what the desire now is? And it's one of the marks of people who really are redeemed. The new desire is this, to live in and walk out the law of God. And now we're getting closer to the fourth purpose of the law. The new desire planted by the new created heart by the Spirit brings with it this new desire to be the person James talks about in James 1, verse 25. The person who looks intently at the perfect law of liberty and sees it not as a law that condemns, but sees it as a law that calls them into the fullness of their living, their kingdom living, and sees it as the royal law of liberty. Liberty from sin. and the things that held me bound for years and years and years. With that new desire comes a new heart, so we begin to say with David in Psalm 27, verse 8, when thou didst say to me, seek my face, I said, okay. No, I didn't. When you said to me, seek my face, my heart said, I will seek your face. And when it's hard to find out, I'm going to keep seeking your face. The telltale mark of truly redeemed people is that they have a new heart. The telltale mark of a new heart is a new desire. So that when thou didst say to me, let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speech be put away from you, I said, okay, you don't have a new heart. I said, I have bitterness and I have strife. and I want more than anything for that inner life of the Spirit to touch those bitter places and I invite you, I invite you into those places because these are the things I want. And when thou didst say to me, be kind, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, my heart said that's what I want. And when thou said to me, put me first, accept no substitutes, revere my name, observe my day, my recreated by God heart said, that's what I want. And show me all the ways that I don't so I can go deeper into my knowledge of you. My favorite Old Testament text on this is Ezekiel 36, 26. Speaking prophetically to Ezekiel, God said this. I want to tell you about the new covenant. It's going to be amazing. Here's what I'm going to do for those people sitting in church at the open door. I'm going to put a new heart in them and I will put a new spirit within them and I will remove their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within them, the same spirit that by the word of his power brought the universe into existence, that spirit I am going to put inside of them and by that spirit in them I will cause them to walk in my statutes and they will be careful to observe my ordinances. It's going to be an inside job. Hebrews 10 says all that this way, quoting Jeremiah, this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws upon their, what? heart and upon their mind I will write them he talks about the law being written on the heart phrases like this come to mind that the kingdom of God is where? within it's within it is not polishing the outside of the cup and of the bowl it is an internal life of the spirit that breeds life bringing it to the outside beloved it is at this point of receiving by faith this new heart implanted by the Spirit of God that our relationship with the law changes. For no longer, when I am in Christ, does the law have the power anymore to kill me or condemn me. It will confront me, and those confrontations will not be particularly pleasant, but it will never have power to condemn me. Why? Romans 8, 1 says, why? for there is now therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ. So the law no longer has the power to kill you or condemn you. Now it calls you. And now as a redeemed of the Lord person, when the law of God is laid out before me, I don't have to be afraid. You know why? Because it doesn't have power to condemn me. It does have power to call me deeper. and say things like this to me, Dave, can we talk about adultery? I know you've never committed adultery. Can we talk about lust? I'd like to bring it to a different place, and I would like to talk about it, and I would like you to allow me to put the searchlight of my spirit in your inner life, in your inner life, and I would like to do a cleansing. I would like to take you deeper into kingdom life. Dave, it's going to sound a little weird to you, because you never murdered anybody, but I'd like to talk to you about murder. Would you let me put the searchlight of my law on the murder room of your heart? And we're not going to talk about you putting a bullet in anybody's brain, but we're going to talk about rage. And we're going to talk about anger. Would you let me do that? And you know why I might just be willing to let him do that and not be afraid? Because I know that this law has no power to condemn me. Now its purpose is to call me. to deeper understandings of him. Let's talk about idolatry, Dave. And I get real defensive about that. Idolatry? I mean, in Israel, we're going to talk about them. They made a golden calf. I never made a golden calf. I mean, that's one we can get through really quick and get to the other juicy ones. Would you be willing, Dave, to talk about the subtle ways in which you found substitute sources of life than me? And there's a piece of me that says, I don't know if I want to do that, because, you know, that work is not going to be pleasant. But you know what I know? It has no power to condemn me. It has power to call me. It has power to call me into a knowledge of and a dependence on God like maybe I've never known. And I've walked with God for years, and you know what he wants from me? To call me deeper. I know that for sure. I know that for sure. And so the law of God calls me to deeper things of kingdom life. And that's the fourth purpose of the law, not to kill you but to call you. And what it calls us to is the ten great words. and what it calls us to is words like this be imitators of God just like children who want to be like their mom and their dad and what it calls us to is words like this Dave walk in love okay and let your love be without hypocrisy boy I need to think about that what does that mean abhor what is evil cling to what is good be devoted to one another in brotherly love be kind tender hearted forgiving one another and when I heard those things my recreated heart said I want your law to expose every place in my heart that those things aren't true and call me to them so in this life I can begin to get a taste of the kingdom of God now. So that I can begin to experience ruling and reigning with him, which I will do forever now. We called it last week having dominion, where our life doesn't run us, we run our life. Galatians 3 says the law was our tutor to drive us to Christ. Then we come to Christ, and he recreates us by his spirit, and he plants in us a new heart. And then this reversal happens. No longer is the law my tutor bringing me to Christ. Christ now, however, becomes my tutor, who brings me back to the law, which is holy and good. And my Redeemer looks at me and says, Dave, I'm going to call you deeper into the glory and the beauty of my precious word for you. Because you, with your life, can paint a beautiful picture. And to that word my recreated heart says, it's what I want. Put me first, accept no substitutes. Revere my name, observe my day. It's what I want. Not that I've obtained it, nor have I already become perfect, Paul said in Philippians 3.12. But make no mistake about this. This is the course of my life. To press on toward the upward call, the kingdom now call of God in Christ. Final question, I close with this. Is the law of God killing you or calling you? That's a good question. Give you some work to do as you leave. If it's killing you, my response to that might surprise you a bit. It's this. Good. And my appeal to you, if the law of God right now is killing you, the appeal is this, to let that law, which is exposing your things, fully do its work of revealing your sin. Breaking through your denial. Don't turn off the light and don't start yelling at people who turn the light on. Let the law fully do its work of revealing your sin and convincing you there's nothing you can do about your sin. Let it fully do its work of finally driving you to Christ, which is your only possible hope today of ever being clean, of ever being free, of driving you to Christ who by faith can redeem you and deliver you, heal you, recreate you, and transform you, and give to you a brand new heart. So that now with a new heart, you can hear the law of God, but it doesn't kill you. See, I want every one of you to be able to come the next several weeks as we go through this and hear the law, knowing that, you know what, it might confront me, and it might even hurt me, but it will not have any power to condemn me. I'm going to let it call. And with a recreated heart, the law of God won't have the power to condemn you, but it will call you to life on a higher plane. I want to close with just a statement. It's something Jesus said when he introduced his kingdom. I think it fits right here for us. The thing he said was this, the kingdom of heaven is within your reach. The experience of the kingdom life of God. As you hear the call of the law of God calling you into the deep places of kingdom life, that kingdom rule is something that you can experience now. I asked the Lord how to close the thing that came to my mind. in terms of a priority concern was this, that there may be, surely are some among us who, before we can even go on to our understanding of the law and how it calls us to life, need a new heart. And if you don't have an implanted by the Spirit, received by faith, new, recreated heart, it's almost going to be hard for you, well, it's going to be impossible for you to actually come with us and the journey we're going to be on for the next several weeks. And you know, my heart is this. I don't want to leave anybody behind on this journey. And so my appeal as I close would be to be to any man or woman, boy or girl, who would be among us, who would say, you know, I'm one of those guys who's turning off the light, or I'm one of those guys who's trying to clean up myself, and I'm really tired, and I'd like to know a little bit more about the hope and the freedom and the cleansing I can find by letting the law do its work when I come to Christ as my only possible hope. Would somebody be willing to talk to me about that today? Yeah, there's going to be some people up here who would love to talk to you and pray with you about what it takes to get a cleansed heart so the law will no longer have power to condemn you, but I'm telling you what, you will have a relationship with the law. It's going to be a good one. It's going to call you. It's going to call you to the deep things of God in Christ. And you know how long it's going to do it? Until Christ is formed in you. Let's pray. Stand with me as we pray. Lord God, we love your law. We love your law, even if what it's doing right now is killing us, because even as Paul talked about how on the front of us, it just killed him. That killing, as it were, that exposed sin and made us aware that there were things in our life that we couldn't clean up ourselves. It made us desperate for your solution, you and your amazing grace. And so even if that's where we are and feeling the pain of that, we love your law. And Father, for those of us who've got redeemed hearts, may be struggling, may be doing a Roman 7 thing right now, we look at your law and recognize it has no power to condemn, but it by the Spirit, by Jesus Christ, who now is our tutor to bring us back to this law for sanctification calls us. And Father, I just pray for courage and tenderness and openness to respond and walk into these words of life. I pray all these things in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, Amen.
