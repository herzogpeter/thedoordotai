Hi, my name is Jean Antonella, and I'm going to talk about codependency stewardship use today. The first thing I think that's important to do is to define these terms, because you can't really see the relationship unless you really know what you're working with. And everybody has heard of the term codependent, and a lot of people have a vague notion of what codependence is. And I have an approach to defining codependence, which is kind of a unique model. It's the idolatry model, and it helps kind of put codependence into a framework that helps understand why people get so followed up in it from a spiritual perspective. And, of course, there are all kinds of psychological and relational ramifications of that. But I think it's a very valid approach and especially a helpful approach in understanding this concept. Codependence cannot really be defined until you take it apart. Codependence is really two terms, co- and dependence. The dependence part refers to the source of the problem for the codependence. That is idolatry. The primary problem for a dependent person is idolatry. any person who's trying to get his or her God needs met, most basic foundational needs met, through means that are not God, we call dependent or idolatrous. There are a lot of different things, and when I talk about the different areas of idolatry, the different things that people chase after to try to get these God needs met, but suffice it right now and say that dependence is a form of idolatry, depending upon something that isn't God. Codependence is also a form of idolatry, but instead of depending upon something that isn't God to meet God needs, it's depending upon a dependent or idolatrous person to meet God needs. Dependence is an idolatrous relationship with a dependent person or another person who's chasing after something that isn't God trying to get to the most basic God needs. What are these God needs? God needs, according to Jeff Van Vanderen, all human beings have three most foundational needs. And when those needs are met, they result in fullness and fullness. And when they're not met, they result in emptiness, shame, longing, lacking, neediness, problems. Those three needs are these. First, to feel convinced that we are loved and accepted without strength. Loved and accepted. Loved and accepted. We all need love and acceptance without strength. That is, for free. Not contingent upon our behavior. Second, we all need to feel that we're worthwhile and capable without strength. that is not contingent upon our production, our earning it, our always doing well, our always being what we're supposed to be. The third need is to feel that we belong, we're not alone. We need to feel connected to the security needs. When these needs are not met without strength, a person is really empty and shame-based. And shame is such a big problem for people. this emptiness, this longing to have these needs. That is such a big problem for people that they go into all kinds of areas of life, searching for a solution to this neediness or this sense of emptiness that they experience. In fact, they most often try to solve it in worldly ways, which are ineffective, because these are all needs that only God can really meet. We all have a certain kind of love, But it's usually love that's contingent upon other persons who hate you. If you think about your relationship, if a certain person that you love did certain things, seen a thing, you know what? I'm sorry. You would reach your limit, because we aren't here in the world. We don't have the kind of love that God has to meet these kinds of heaven do need. So, people try to solve these needs in other ways, because they don't know God offers to meet these needs, and if they do know, we just have a terrific affinity for idolatry. Human beings really love to try to fix themselves. Codependence is one of the ways that people try to solve their emptiness in need of God. In order to be idolatrous, you have to have idols. You have to have things to go to and specific things to go to. Now, I'm not going to go into this in detail because we don't have time, but let me just tell you this more quickly. You don't have to write this down, but I want you to get the gist of what idols are like. The first characteristic of idols is that they work at first. Getting into an idolatrous thing, in order to feel more secure or more full, it's going to feel good at first. It's certainly not going to not work at the beginning, because then it wouldn't have any power over people, but it's going to feel good at first, it's going to work at first to solve the problem. The second thing is it's going to help you lead to addiction or dependence, Because it works, okay? Not because it doesn't work. Number three, very, very important characteristic of idols. Fail eventually. Idols always let people down eventually. But then because they're hooked, and because they're hooked on something that's really ineffective, they leave the person worse off them before they start into an idolatrous relationship. In other words, they increase the sense of emptiness, failure, longing, neediness. All the things that you went into to try and fix are worse. after the relationship has developed. Popular modern idols list, work, performance, money, things, religion, success, power, fame, chemicals and drugs, beauty, art, achievement, children, sex, thinness and weight loss, physical prowess, and other people. That's a partial list. Make your own list. Maybe your list will be longer. But that's a partial list of some of the things that human beings go to try to feel better about themselves. You'll know it's on the list of things that are good, socially acceptable, things that are not socially acceptable. And so there are good idols and bad idols, but I've got news for you. The bad idols that actually are advocating to have because they look bad, and the good idols are worse for you because they're harder to get done. I haven't been working with him for years. It's so hard to get through to him because he was just doing his job, supporting his family. If he was a pastor, it would have been even harder than doing God's work. So idols are idolatrous. Idols are always harmful, whether the dependence is on something positive and social acceptable or something negative. You might have noticed that the very last one in this list is other people. Last but not least, very, very common form of idolatry, other people. This is what codependence is. We don't pick, though, we codependents don't pick people who are stable, healthy, God-fearing people to develop our adoptive relationship. No, no, we pick people who are even quicker, at least you think they are, even quicker than we are. It is much easier to lose yourself in the life of a person that's really dysfunctional, really screwing himself up. I'm going to go quickly through some, stop me if I go too fast, because sometimes I do. But it's very important to get this groundwork in order to later understand how spiritual abuse is meshes with this type of profile of a problem. These definitions, please don't try to write them down because they're too long. You could write down a word or two as a cue if you wanted to. But this is just kind of an overview of looking at codependent cysts, people with idolatrous relationships with dependent people, looking at it from a number of different angles. The first one is symptoms that develop in an individual who lives with an alcoholic or other dependent person. The only antidote to that is to really be focused on God. if you're going to live with a chemistry-dependent person or a work-adictive person or that person that's in that list trying to solve their God needs without God, the only way to not develop a sick relationship with that person, an idolatrous one, is to be really tight and focused on God. It almost never happens. Just because by the nature of that, the illness of idolatry, other people in the surrounding area are stuck yet to the sick system. So sins of one person often spill over into the whole system of the surrounding area. Number two, a person who depends on an idolatrous person for her high or thick escapes from emptiness. You can really focus on this person's problems that isn't too, and you're off the hook. The most effective distraction from a shame-based person is hooking up with a person who's more shame-based than you. Number three, a person who alternatively plays God and then puts other people in her God spot. This is an I'm in charge case. So a codependent can be playing the role of God, which is basically she's her own idol or he's his own idol. And then puts all the responsibility on another person and says, well, you play God now. You tell me what you're doing. It's a very bizarre shift because it's like, okay, I'm in control and in charge. I'm going to decide everything. I'm going to manage everything. I'm going to run the whole show. And then by giving up, when they get really, really tired of that, and they're going, okay, I'll do it again. It doesn't matter. I mean, it really is crazy, but that's not an uncommon pattern. Four, a person who absorbs other people's pain compulsively into the exclusion of his or her own mental and emotional integrity. Just flip your hand up here, really. Five, someone who gets her identity or sense of who she is from another person. Having an underdeveloped sense of her own separate personhood with her own needs, her own goals, her own things is a mixture with another person. I don't know where I leave off and you start and vice versa. The most responsible-looking, irresponsible people in the world is not responsible to go around trying to be responsible for other people's responsibilities. Seven people are chronically nice and angry. There's a huge discrepancy between co-dependent and other idolatrous people between outside of the cup and inside of the cup. This is one definition of mental illness. There's a discrepancy between how people look on the outside and what's going on inside of them. A person committed to keeping things going to exclusion and denial of reality. People who have a compulsive urge to meet other people's needs and wants, often at the expense of their own needs and wants. Are you thinking of how all these situations fits into this paradigm? Ten, people who habitually overinvest in the thoughts and opinions of other people. I call that OPM addiction. Other people who have heard opinions of me. OPM addiction. And eleven, persons who have not learned to allow consequences of other people's choices to occur. People who have this compulsory system fixed to make rice, to cover up, to cut and paste. Now, I know none of you have any of those symptoms, but I'm going to mention the specific symptoms of codependence because codependence is such a broad classification of disturbance. And really, when you think of the pathology involved, you'll understand why the list is very long of the symptoms. When you just think through what the codependent is trying to do, what a codependent is trying to accomplish, the codependent is playing God or making sure that somebody else, one other person, is playing God in his life or her life, it puts tremendous pressure on us as a human being to do that. And so most of these symptoms are, they're kind of management crises that the codependent goes through trying to keep these, you know, 18 Godballs up in the air without God in our life at all. Number one, poor boundaries, which can be investment or isolation, either too much overlap or too far. And it usually goes back and forth. Number two, a lack of intimacy. Three, crisis mongering. It's all this distraction, you know, can you see this distraction? You know, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, the ambulance is going by. Well, you don't have to pay attention yourself if there's an ambulance going by in your life. Am I right? Yeah, no. That's the crises. I married a person who had so many bill-paying crises and was so incredibly immature and irresponsible, I never had to spend five minutes a day thinking about my own life. And I didn't really know how to spend five minutes a day thinking about my own life Because before I married him, I had spent all my time thinking about my mother and how to make her feel better. Oh, I'm sorry. Lack of intimacy. I'm sorry. That's an important one. Lack of intimacy. You can understand why it would be difficult to get close to a court of tennis. They're over-employed. You know what I mean? Number four, need to control. Tremendous need to control. There's a terrific sense of anxiety. Who am I? What am I about? Am I good enough? Am I okay? No. Well, all the answers to those questions are no. So, you know, you've got to fix that all the time. You've got to fix everybody. You've got to make sure everything looks right. You need to control. Five, anxiety. That makes sense. Number six, opium dependence. Dependence upon other people's inferred opinions and needs. The reason I say inferred is because most podepedents don't even know what other people are thinking about them. They just figure it out in their minds. It's one of those things that they think about so they don't have to think about themselves in their own life. Seven, confusion. Aren't you getting confused as listening to this list? I mean, it is a very heavy list. Confusion. Number eight, poor self-esteem. Nine, phoniness. Dishonesty, pretending. Again, you know, outside and the inside don't match. Always try to adjust how things look to meet the needs of the people out there, these people out there. Because the need for approval and affirmation is all about other people. It's not about, does God approve me? 10, stuffed emotions. 11 is related, emotional outbursts and leaking. 12, out of touch with feelings. Those are all related. You can't be in touch with your real feelings, which would actually provoke some genuine interaction with other people. If you were, emotional outbursts and outtouches feelings. The feelings are very, very threatening to codependents. Because feelings are about the genuine you in there. And the reason that that's frightening and threatening is codependents have this idea about, She's very judgmental in the first place because of how bad she feels inside herself. So when she comes across other people, her tendency is to judge. And so she assumes that other people judge her, so she's trying to constantly do the thing that is going to avoid the judgment of other people. Because that's where she's trying to get her feelings all changed. That's where she's trying to get her security. That's where she's trying to get her sense of who she is. Can you see how this complete absence of identity drives this person? This is true for all people who don't know God. You know, it really helps you understand why the world is spinning the way it is. Okay, 13 mood swings, 14 rage, 15 anger. Anger is chronic and unresolved. There's nothing wrong with anger. Anger is old. Hey, Paul said, be angry. He really did. He said, be angry. Everybody's angry. every day if you're breathing. But chronic unresolved anger is not good. It festers. It putrefies. It stinks. It comes out in mean, icky ways. Blaming, 16. Self-righteousness, 17. All defenses. These are all defenses designed to try to prop the person up. Okay, now, stop writing. I'm going to go, I'm going to ride through the rest of them. denial, victim role, emotional over-neediness, exaggerated sense of power, exaggerated sense of responsibility, manipulative and indirect, depression, perfectionism, fantastic but perverted radar, very, very good at picking up cues in other people, overdeveloped sense of empathy. But what they do with those cues is so sick. They take those cues, which are really, really big, and they try to adjust their own behavior to make sure the other person is okay with who they are, rather than ever turning that 16-foot radar in on themselves and saying, wait a minute, what should I be doing here? It's all about outside. Delusion, projection, legalism, track-based outcome. Probably there are 100,000 other symptoms that I could come up with if I had enough time, but these symptoms and defenses, important to know are learned and reinforced by anxiety and shame reduction. They work at first. These are functions of idolatrous relationships. And the shame reduction and the emptiness reduction is temporary, of course. Gradually, though, the court of conduct gets sicker and sicker and sicker. And these not only do not meet the needs of the individual person, they actually create a greater state of neediness. I almost died from codependence. I could have died from codependence. I was suicidal for a long time. I actually attempted to do that several times. And so I know that it's a very serious disorder. It's a long, horrible throat. That's codependence. So you've got kind of a feel for it. Spiritual abuse. You ought to know what spiritual abuse is by now. Have anybody got just kind of a cohesive definition of spiritual abuse from all of the talks that you've been in on since the beginning of the seminar? You know, a little one or two sentence summation. Thank you for sharing. That actually probably didn't get tape recorded. Well, that sounds good. That sounds right. That's what spiritual abuse is. People come, they need help, you know, they're vulnerable, they're open, and they not only don't get help, they get kind of kicked in the shin. The spiritual shin. Spiritual abuse, I will try to explain why spiritual abuse and codependence go together so well. And you may be able to shed some light from your perspective on that too. I feel that the codependent especially is vulnerable to spiritual abuse because if a person is other-centered and there's false spiritual teaching coming up, the lack of that core, the lack of that discernment piece inside them and the focus on other people and how other people are going to react and what other people are going to say keeps them off the topic at hand, which is judging what's coming at them, really looking at what, you know, they're in a counseling situation and it's a spiritually abusive relationship, and they're so worried about whether their counsel likes them that they can't see for what it is. Idolatry makes the codependent vulnerable to spiritual abuse, simply because idolatry is a false and damaging way to seek to get your needs met. It takes people away from the power and healing and resourcefulness that God offers, rather than toward him. So idolatry really is a setup for the vulnerability of spiritual abuse. I think the foundation of all spiritual abuse is the focus off or miss teaching of the central message of the gospel. Whenever people get away from the grace of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Savior, who died for your sins so that you could be set free, and free indeed, whenever there's a departure from that central focal point of the gospel, there's danger of spiritual abuse. This includes cults, religious systems that look more mainstream, And, term I love, churchianity. And that's, you know, that's a church that just isn't doing what the church is supposed to do. There are a lot of churches that are doing. Religious systems misuse an abuse codependent people in order to accomplish their goals. Now, they don't identify. You put a little flag on your head, you know, that you're codependent. but I'm telling you, abusive systems can smell victims a mile away. And when they put up their little placard and advertise, you know, this is an abusive system looking for people to get involved, codependents are fairly racing each other to get there. And this is why. The definition of spiritual abuse is perverting of the gospel message or misuse of spiritual authority to manipulate, control, or exploit people. The skit on Thursday night with Holly and Kurt was really between two codependent people. Did you notice the lack of the centeredness in both of those people? And no, you know, you know, you know, no, you know. Well, the top ten reasons that spiritual abuse and codependence are related, I put in a format like my friend David Letterman does. I'm going to do a countdown on these top ten reasons. I don't want you to try to write them down if you can help it. Because I'd like you to just think about it. And you know, there's so much. And I ran through this with my sister last night. And she kept saying, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Say that again. No, no, no. Say the first sentence again. Because it's kind of meek to chew on. You know, those are little pieces that we have to think through. So, number 10. Top 10 reasons spiritual abuse and codependence are related. Number 10. Spiritual abuse can promote codependence in vulnerable individuals. because of a misleading joy message. Anybody know what the joy message is? Oh, God, I knew that somebody was going to be here. I'm going to have them taught that in Sunday school. Spiritual abusive systems can actually promote the development of codependent in vulnerable individuals because of the message of joy. How to have joy? This is how to have joy. Sunday schools everywhere in the world, probably in the world, have been taught this. Okay, this is the order priority that you're supposed to do your life in. Jesus comes first, and other people come second, and then you come last, if you have any time and energy left over at the end of the day. The trouble with this is it's not scriptural, because Jesus did not say, love others after yourself, or before yourself. He didn't say, love others instead of yourself. He said, love others as well as yourself. so the real message of the gospel is Job Jesus and you and others and you and others as together in the same breath you're just as worthy as your neighbor to be taken care of and guess what you're better equipped to take care of yourself than you are equipped to take care of your neighbor and if you don't take responsible care of your own needs it's very likely you're not going to be very well equipped to be taking care of your neighbor either this message the perversion of this message joy trains people that Christianity means codependence because codependence tend to ignore their own needs and put out for other people's needs not because it's coming from their heart but because they're so insecure they need to focus off themselves and on other people in order to feel more safe more okay more valuable more worthwhile They're trying to get those basic movements. Number nine, codependents have a special affinity for spiritually abusing others. Codependents have a special affinity for spiritually abusing others as a way of exercising control, promoting the illusion of superiority in order to deal with their own poor self-esteem. So they're compensating for this legitimate centeredness that only God can bring by putting themselves up and above in an abusive role with other people to get the counterfeit feelings of power and control. Number eight, the freedom and responsibility of the gospel. The freedom, we are at liberty, the freedom and the real, the right response. What is the responsibility of the gospel? Do you remember when Jesus was talking to the Pharisees and he said, actually they said to him, what is the work that we should do to work the works of God? They wanted a list. Because then they wanted to go and do the list and then they could say, well, I did the works list that the rabbi told me to do. And he said, this is the work that you must do if you would work the work to God. What did he say? Go to the temple three times a week, religiously, and read the Torah every single day for an hour and a half. What did he say? He said, believe in the one whom he has sent. What's the responsibility of the Christian? Believe in the one whom he has sent. If you don't get that right, nothing else will work. Because it's all going to be flesh. It's all going to be filthy rag. The freedom and responsibility of the gospel intimidates and confuses codependents. Why? Because they're idolatry. They're chasing after non-God stuff all the time. So they gravitate toward legalistic, authoritarian, spiritually abusive systems as a way of avoiding having to face up to these crises in their own lives. If anyone looks at the freedom and responsibility of the gospel, they don't know what to do with it. But they do know what to do in controlling manipulative, spiritually abusive systems. There's a sense of, albeit worldly, there's a sense of security there. There are people telling you what to do. There are people giving you a road map. They give you a list of things to do to get close to God and be a good Christian person. Okay, number seven. Yeah, sure. It sure could have developed there. You might have had tendencies. I think women, just biological things, are more tending towards codicum and because we're the caretakers and all that stuff, and all that kind of dovetails with, you know, the sick part of that. But look at your relationships and also your behavior and maybe the symptoms list before you got involved in the church, and I bet you'll find some traits there already. Because, you know, I don't think your relationship with the church would have worked as well if you hadn't already had some penchant for being in a system that was really not respectful of you as a person. I think it would come to you in the middle of the night. Okay, number seven, the performance gospel, and this is in quotes, the performance gospel, the work harder, try harder, that's the way to get close to God, It's especially appealing to codependents who are self-not-God dependent. And this is a common theme in spiritual religious assistance, the performance gospel. You can see why that feels secure to people, the performance thing, where you get the list, you know, the to-do list, and you do that, and then you know you did it, and there you go. You're all right. Right, exactly. Big checks, and then you do the checks, and just like your to-do list, You know, you cross off everything and think, oh, I accomplished a lot today. I must be an okay person. I think that's a really big one. Number six, codependents tend to accept authoritarian style or non-egalitarian systems where the distribution of power is very lopsided. Spiritual abuse most often occurs in this type of system. Where you put yourself under people. Codependents tend to accept authoritarian-style systems. These are non-egalitarian, authoritarian-style systems, where there's a lot of power here and little or no power here. Where the distribution of power is very lopsided and spiritual abuse occurs in such systems. And codependents are usually okay with that, this big power and this little or no power. The Catholic Church for a year, a century, really, the hallmark of the Catholic Church system hierarchy was like that because except for the priests, nobody was even literate. And so the priests were not only the spiritual leaders, but they were the only people who could even read the scriptures and interpret that. So the power that was vested in them because of that was just enormous. and they were almost penalized. Can you imagine? They spoke in Latin. That'll keep people down on it. They were always cooking up some way to make sure that the people didn't actually, you know, I don't mean to be critical about Catholicism. I'd be very careful, because I was raised Catholic, I have some strong deals about Catholicism, but I'm respectful of people that do Catholicism. That's okay. But that was one thing about the history of the Church was this terrific, and of course there was tremendous abuses as there have been for centuries. Okay, number five. Codependents are idolatrous. We've established that. They lack clear discernment because of this. You're not God-dependent. You're not going to be clear-thinking, clear-headed where spiritual issues are concerned. And if they have got discernment, they lack the wherewithal to pay attention to the messages that they discern. They lack the courage because of their need for approval and their need for affirmation and their need for everybody to think they're okay. And so to actually go up to the pastor or go up to a Sunday school teacher or a church leader or anybody, a counselor, and say, you know, I really didn't feel comfortable about how you talked to that person, or how you talked to me, or how you talked to the truth. You know, you seem really spiritual, really wicked. You sound like a bigot. Too scary. Too scary because of where the security is resting. Number four, codependents are so eager to please and to be affirmed that they don't think straight in identifying obvious spiritual abuse. And sometimes it's just right there, and they have elaborate denial systems to keep them from actually seeing it because it's so threatening. Three, codependents tend to look for directions from outside themselves because they don't trust their own inner core. They don't trust their own inner core. By the way, spiritually abusive systems don't, as healthy systems do, they don't teach people that they have the Holy Spirit if they're a member of the body of Christ. they don't teach people that it's like they want to keep that power for themselves they don't say to a person coming with a spiritual question well have you looked in your own heart about this have you talked to the Lord about this have you prayed about this what do you think about this they kind of keep that power position for themselves so they don't trust their own inner core or the fact that they have the Holy Spirit, spiritual use of systems often provide this illegitimate direction because they want to keep the power, because they're into controlling and manipulating and maybe just people are doing and going and doing what they want rather than what God might be moving them to do. Like God might actually move to a different church down the street. They don't want that. Number two, codependents see themselves as victims and tend to seek to perpetuate this role. Very important. Spiritual abuse assistance and relationships victimize suddenly and overtly with the permission of the person. Maybe they don't know up here in the front low, but somewhere back here in the lizard brain, they know something's wrong. But they give permission. This is a basic psychological principle. victims tend to keep getting victimized. And they tend to go towards systems that will victimize them. Number one, drum roll, please. One, co-dependents are accustomed to abuse. They're accustomed to lies. They're accustomed to manipulation. They're accustomed to misinformation. And so spiritual abuse feels normal. Okay, so what are you going to do? What are you going to do about this? You've got co-dependents. You're in a spiritual abusive system. what are you going to do? This is a big problem. It's a big problem. First of all, I think it's a good idea to do a self-check. You probably are already doing self-check, but in case you haven't, it's a good idea to do a self-check. And identify your own codependent tendencies. And if you're not sure about just identifying those symptoms I'm listed, then look at your relationships in the past. Look at your relationships in the past. You see, and maybe try to identify the dependence, because the dependent person might be a little bit easier to identify than the cult. See if you've got some idolatrous people in your life. Really not grounded in God, not basically secure. People are chasing after stuff to try to kind of prop themselves up. That might help you see a codependent relationship. pay attention to inside cues regarding spiritual relationships teaching and activities pay attention when you go to a spiritual place I don't care what the church is I don't care where it's being held I don't care if Billy Graham's going to be there get your discernment out get your discernment out and keep it out the whole time it says test everything that's because it's wise and we need to test everything because there's so much reference going on. Watch for feelings of false guilt, uneasiness, or compulsivity. Watch for feelings of false guilt, uneasiness, compulsivity. You notice how all this is going into yourself? You're going into who you are and what you think and your instincts and your intuition. And I really believe that when we accept Christ, that all that is quickened with no light. And so all that is made not for the service of sin anymore, but for the service of our spiritual development. So pay attention to feelings of false guilt, uneasiness, compulsivity. You know what, when you get that, I don't know. Don't just ignore that. Just stay with it. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. There's something about this I don't want. I'm not even sure what it is. I don't know. Caution. When you say yes and you want to say no. Really caution. Big caution lights. Big yellow lights. When you say yes or any other lies, you pick up on yourself. Agreeing to do something you don't even believe in. Okay, helping somebody out that you don't want to help out because you can't stand them. But, you know, like doing it as like this whatever act of mercy or, you know, trying to fix yourself, trying to make yourself feel better about who you are or better about how badly you feel towards them or about them. Pay attention to your motives. Don't ignore why you go. Don't ignore why you don't go. Go to the door while you don't want to go. Stay with it. Make your decisions with him and his will and his life in mind. Keep your focus on Jesus as your source of your fullness and attainment. This is basically the foundational antidote for this whole follow-up. If you don't have God in the centerpiece of your life, if you don't know that he is the sort of meeting these deep needs, that he really sees you as his beloved kid, no matter how you behave yesterday or this morning or last week or last month, it doesn't matter to him. He says he forgives your sins and he has to forgive your sins. The future, you're all washed off. You're all fresh and bright and new. He just thinks you're going to catch me out. If you know that, then you're much less likely to be vulnerable to chasing after a dog's stuff. And you're much more likely to notice when you do it. And that's not about what you chase after. It's about why you chase after it. Bodybuilding is a wonderful thing. But if you're trying to get your basic alcanus from bodybuilding, it's idolatry. fight the right fight keep your alliance to Christ pure free from bargaining, manipulation, delusion distraction, world meaning you can only do that by making these checkups on yourself and that's kind of constantly paying attention this is why I think people call it prayer times I think people do prayer times and they pray and it's all like this way and I just think that that quietness, the kind of resting, you know, people call it waiting on God, waiting on the Lord. I think it's such a good idea because that's the time when I think these insights can hit us, when maybe something we're ignoring can really come heavy into our heads, and we can be forced to look and say, okay, all right, all right, yep, I know I did that. I know I didn't want to do that. I just did it. I thought I should, and I should on myself. And it was wrong. And now what am I going to do? Okay, I'm going to get myself off that committee. I shouldn't be on that committee. I hate that committee. That's not me at all. That's not my gift. That's not my call. I did it because they begged and begged and begged and begged and begged and guilted me. And finally, after the guilt part, I said, okay. Well, now I'm going to un-okay that. And, you know, you've got to do these little check-ups. Otherwise, you'll find yourself caught up, victimized by systems that usually, unknowingly, spiritually abuse people. I don't think most churches, and it's very, very rare for people in a church situation to actually set out consciously or spiritually abuse people. Just so much. Sexual abuse is different. People do set out to harm. I mean, they do set, they don't think about the harm, but they do set out to do something they know is wrong and wicked and bad. Usually, Christians are so insidious. That's why it's worth having a seminar, because it's sneaky. And we need to be made aware to it so that we can be alert to the signs and symptoms in ourselves and in systems that surround us. Think about if you need, in this area, counseling, mentoring, and support. some people get in really, really bad abusive church systems and they end up so beat up emotionally they really do need kind of a recovery period to get through it they're just bruised and broken and some of you might be able to relate to that but there are in healthy systems there should be people that you can at least come up alongside with and get the kind of support for recovery that you really need. Surely it's here to be open door with all the photographs that you need to be able to use those places to seek that out.. So we just kind of, we try to stay in this, the way we steal the theater with just ourselves and then try to get, you know, try to kind of swap to get there and make it happen. But that's really cool because we really need each other to bring the Bible to the Bible. You know, we're kind of trying to be there. So if you're bad at this, you know you're bad at this, that's something you really work on. You can end up in the news getting a thousand dollars and putting it down in the morning. I want this and I need this. And then after you make those lists for a week or two, actually pointing up somebody else. Telling them that you have a good one and you can then ultimately, if you're really going to be scary, It would be very good to do. Did he actually ask you something to help you with what was wanting me? And it wasn't that easy to learn. But that, yes, I appreciate your comments. Because people in recovery, it's like a pendulum swinging clear over your side. Well, before, I was all being a dust, all pathetic dependence on everyone. And I was just awesome. And now I'm just going to be this sitting unto myself. And I'm not that, and I'm not ever going to feel so good. I'm going to have no idea. Wrong. Okay, wrong. So this is our retraining is asking people not to lead diligently. Thank you. I think people that are really doing a lot, that really, that are just holding on to me. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. They just don't care. Because it's all we need. Because they are, I mean, you want to be in these people. I mean, how? How much more can be in the answer to that? And she needs us. Who cares? You know? I mean, you can make our way. I mean, that's what's so interesting about the spiritually oppressive, maybe that's just one of the precious systems. So people kind of paying attention to these details with other people.... So what gave life? What gave it to you? And that's pretty crazy. When you think about that, he started to the blind Friday night, you know, on Saturday. He was here. You know, he was walking with God. And there, like, yes, you know, it's a very good point. The ultimate solution, of course, is getting a community from God. Period. And that's the thing to work on the whole thing. Keep getting what you need from God. Then you'll have what you need to recognize and deal with spiritual, because it's a great way. You'll recognize it right away when it happens to you. And then you'll have the courage. It'll be scary, maybe. I may not be easy or, you know, feel like a real life, but you will have the courage. If not right in the situation, then sometimes it'll happen to you. It's all personal. It's all. It's going to be a little bit. It happens. Thank you.
