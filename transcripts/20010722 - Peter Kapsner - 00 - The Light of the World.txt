Oh, a few weeks ago during the sermon, we watched a video clip that is still sticking with me today. It was a video that told the story of several teenagers in suburban Atlanta who were living a lifestyle of extremely disordered sexuality. Now what struck me most deeply as I watched the video was the vacant look in the eyes of the teenagers who were being interviewed. It was a look that spoke of a sort of resignation, which says that life is empty, and any chance for love or hope or joy, real love or hope or joy, is just a pipe dream. Unfortunately, as I observe young people, even in our own city, in shopping malls and movie theaters, I often just catch glimpses of that same look. It seems such hopelessness is not confined to just the city of Atlanta. And on even a broader scope, beyond observing our young people only, As I interact with my neighbors and work out at the club or eat in restaurants, I see a similar vacant look in the eyes of many adults as well. It's just that adults have often, over time, become better at hiding it, able to outwardly conceal what turns out to be a deep-down belief that life really is empty. If you look closely as to how we spend our time in society and what we appear driven to pursue, then I think we have to think that many believe love and joy and peace can only fleetingly be found in the latest promotion, the latest product or experience, and the amount of sex that it's had. Society lives in a world of disordered money, sex, and power. Now, as I've made such observations, they lead me to a sort of question. Kind of a long question, and I'll see if I can ask it this way. If I believe that God and his kingdom are available now, and I do, and if I believe that the experience of God, Father, Son, and Spirit, enables us and calls us into a different kind of life, where there really is love and hope and joy, then how in the world will the people with whom we interact every single day of our lives, some even as close to us as our family or our neighbors or the people with whom we work, Some people with vacant stares and broken hearts, how will they ever come to know of this different kind of life? For how is it that teenagers we all know, searching for love and their disordered sexuality, could ever find the true lover of their soul? How is it that the business person sitting next to us, maybe on the airplane or in the restaurant, believing the lie that their peace and satisfaction is just around the next corner of promotion? How could they be stopped in their tracks? by the giver of true peace? Or how can a hopeless, nursing home-bound, older adult ever encounter the source of all hope? Who will show them this new kind of life? Who will let them know that the kingdom is here and that God is present, even as we just sang about? Who will let them know that life can be different? In his book, The Essence of the Church, Craig Van Gelder states that the church, however else we define it, and we define it in a lot of different ways, but however else we define it is essentially this. The church is God's people who are God's personal presence in the world. The church is God's people who are God's personal presence in the world. Meaning the church is not a religious organization or a building of brick and mortar located in Maple Grove. The church, at least in its New Testament usage, refers simply to the women and to the men and to the children who have new life in Christ by the power of God's Spirit. Jesus looks at us, and in a staggering statement in Matthew 5, 14, as his followers, he says this, You as my people, the church, are the very light of the world. Just as I am the true light of the world, I will give you my Spirit to dwell with you and dwell in you, And you will be the extensions of my hands and my feet and my face to the world. You will be the true light of the world. So how will the people around us that we sit next to every single day, some of them even close to us, how will they ever know of a new kind of life? Well, in answering this again, Jesus never referred to a weekend event or to a good sermon or to an outreach program. He simply referred to the people who would be his hands and his feet feet and his faiths, and they were tax collectors and fishermen, religious leaders and carpenters. Today they would include teachers and business people, doctors and homemakers, students and factory workers. It would be all of us. This is our identity as the church. This is what it means to be the church. And yet through the generations, as the church and the surrounding culture have met, it seems that again and again the people of God have lost this sense of identity. they become some warped hybrid of a culture gone bad. And I believe this is true even in 21st century America. As a church, the people of God, us included, often lose our identity as the hands and the feet in the face of Christ. Instead, we see ourselves as consumers of just another product called the church. And then we lose our identity. And who is left to speak into the vacant expressions of a world lost in its hopelessness? Who will speak to the neighbor next door, to the business person we eat next to, or to the family member close to us? Who is left to proclaim that the kingdom of God is here? And with that, I would like to pray as we begin. God, I ask that the word would be strong this morning, that it would be filled with your grace, but it would also be filled with your truth. That in its going forth, we'll begin to see ourselves differently and recapture the sense of what it is to which we are called. I ask these things by the power of your Spirit. Amen. Now, I don't know what your first reaction would be if I asked the question, what do you think is the greatest threat to the people of God losing their sense of identity? For me, I think the first response that I might be prone to have is that I would think, well, persecution. Persecution is the greatest threat to the people of God. Actually, throughout history, though persecution can be horrifying to those who experience it, it actually has drawn people into the kingdom of God. The accounts of early Christianity state that as the thousands of people in the Roman Colosseum were watching the Christians being martyred for their faith, being torn apart by lions and being burned at the stake that these same onlookers were so moved that these Christians in the midst of that could hold hands and sing and pray right up to the point of their death that the people watching became Christians themselves. So moved by an incomprehensible sense of love and joy and peace that they walked into the kingdom. So though persecution was horrible in so many ways it actually caused the spread of the church in early Europe and Asia. Even today, in the same places, places of sometimes intense persecution, we find people entering God's kingdom at a more rapid rate than anywhere else in the world. I work in a factory one day a week, and I was recently speaking there with a Russian friend of mine who is also a believer. And in our conversation, as much as we could understand of one another, I speak no Russian, and he speaks only broken English, he was still able to communicate to me that in Russia, in his home, that the church, though being persecuted, is growing at an incredible rate. The people of God are just emerging as a result, just experiencing in a black and white nature the love and peace and joy of God in the midst of horrible persecution. I was talking with a minister friend of mine as well, and one of us stated that, as horrible as it might seem, American Christians might actually benefit from some persecution. It might shake us free from this subtle yet devastating blending of church and culture in which we find ourselves, where our whole church life sort of becomes gray. A blending that has left the people of God indistinguishable from the world and has compromised our sense of identity as the hands and the face of Christ. I thought this was an interesting and sort of scary point. But it was a point, as I reflected on it, that speaks to the true historical reality that through the generations, the greatest threat to the people of God losing their sense of identity has been when the church and the culture began to blend. Let me give you just a few examples. Israel in the Old Testament experienced their greatest loss of kingdom power when they began to blend in with the pagan cultures around them. If you read through the Old Testament, you'll see God again and again warning them against this. Don't have anything to do with the pagan culture. You will lose your sense as my personal presence in the world. The apostolic letters were all written to various gatherings of people who were in danger of losing their sense of identity as the hands in the face of Christ. Instead, they were blending in cultural practices which were the opposite of this kind of life. Now, moving out of biblical history, when Constantine legalized Christianity in the 4th century, Christianity quickly became corrupt. As the people of God, who really had no interest in really being a part of the kingdom of God, just came from the world into the church, and they just went ahead and said, hey, now the church can be the place in which I can utilize power and control. And the culture and the church began to blend there as people who had no interest in the kingdom really took positions of power. In the war-torn Middle Ages, Christianity took on the form of the Crusades. People tried to use Christianity to justify the thousands of people who were slaughtered. I'm quite sure this didn't accurately represent the face of God to the world. Now, one of the most interesting characters in history, and one of my personal favorites, was the delusional Henry VIII, who at one point, sort of on a whim, decided that he didn't really like the Pope. And so he was going to declare himself Pope over the Church of England and combine his governmental authority with now spiritual authority. I love this guy's delusions. I just told Hallie the other day that I'm actually declaring myself Pope of our family. Didn't last very long. But the Church of England became a bastion of corrupt politics rather than the people of God be in the hands and face of Christ to the world. Believe it or not, Hitler actually justified or tried to his destruction of the Jews on Christian principles. Horrifying what can happen when the culture and the church begin to blend. And these are just some of the examples we find throughout history. Well, on the list goes as we enter now 21st century America, where thankfully, because we've had a separation of church and state, that this blending has not taken place. Actually, I think when we begin to actually look into things, we may see that a blending has indeed taken place. Begin to explore what our country's foundational principles are, and I believe we will see a manifestation of a subtle yet devastating blending that has left the people of God not thinking of themselves anymore as the hands and the feet in the face of Christ, rather the look at the church as just another product to consume. I submit to you for your consideration, beginning with a quick discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of our country. I know how exciting. I submit for your consideration this current blending of church and culture. The United States of America was founded on the philosophical concept of individualism, meaning simply this. Individualism is the doctrine that any organization exists to meet the needs of the people. Any organization, whatever form it might take, exists to meet the needs of the people. Now, John Locke, a philosopher from the 17th century, had a profound effect on our founding fathers with his thoughts on individualism, specifically Thomas Jefferson. And Jefferson, as a result, wrote these words. See if they sound familiar. All human beings are endowed with certain inalienable rights, or needs, as it were. Among them were the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Does that sound familiar? Oh gosh, there's actually more nodding of heads in this service. I was worried about the 7th grade history that previous services it had. Well, Locke believed that any governmental institution should exist for making sure that these human needs, as it were, were met. So this again is the philosophical concept of individualism. It's the principle on which America was founded. And so now it's this individualism, whether we're really even aware of it or not, that has become the very air that we breathe. It permeates all that we are and everything that we do. In fact, nearly every American organization of which I could think exists to meet the needs of the people. Let me give you again some examples. At least in theory, our representative form of government is set up individualistically. The people dictate through their voting and money and lobbying what policies are enacted, what laws are set, and where our tax money is spent. So we vote and give our money and lobby according to what will meet our needs in such areas. If a politician is not meeting our needs, well then we have the power to rise up and call for a change in the organization, a change that will better serve us. So it's an example of an organization existing specifically to meet the needs of the people. Our consumer-driven economy is also set up this way. For here, the people dictate, by where they spend their money, what products companies should offer. If they are meeting the needs of the consumer, well, such companies take off. If they don't meet the needs of the consumer, they go under. Target has gone nationwide, specifically because of its incredible ability to meet the needs of the consumer. I don't know how Target does it, but I can vow that I'm walking into that store only to get a Snickers bar and a roll of paper towels, and I walk out with a cart full of merchandise some $100 later, full of things I didn't even know I needed. I've actually become convinced that the target sign is the mark of the beast. Restaurants function this way, as do all forms of entertainment, technology, the automotive industry, grocery stores. Everything in our economy functions from the same basic starting place. meet the needs of the consumer. It's individualism at its finest. Now, this concept also makes its way into why we take certain jobs or why we might stay there. The organization for which we work must meet our demands for a certain amount of money, our need for professional development, our need to live in a desired location, and our need to be fulfilled in our career. If some or all of these needs are not met, what do we do? We move on. Sadly enough, individualism can often make its way into the relationships of our lives as well. Marriages can be a prime example of this, as people enter into them with the mindset that this other person exists to meet my needs. My needs for love, for self-esteem, for sexuality and for family, for companionship. And if one or both of the partners determine that they're not getting their needs met in some way, They move on. While the list goes on, we pick travel destinations that meet our needs. We choose books or magazines along these lines. The clothes we wear, the schools we attend, the degrees we pursue, the computers we buy, the version of the Bible we read, the pens that we use, the bank in which we put our money, the pet we select, our long-distance phone company, our internet service provider, the house we buy, the city in which we live, and the soap that we purchase. All of these things, and hundreds more, are based on what we perceive will meet our needs. Individualism is the air that we breathe every day of our lives, confronted with it all over. It's the air that we breathe, and it is deeply marked how we think and what we do. And I wonder if we take it one step beyond the examples I just gave, that we might find that individualism has made its way into the church. And the people of God begin to lose their identity as the hands and the feet in the face of Christ to the world. I think that this loss of identity as the hands and feet of Christ begins subtly in the church, as most distortions do. This one, I think, begins with the mindset that when we use the word church as we speak, when we just in normal conversation say church, well, we're really meaning an organized structure instead of the people of God with whom we journey. this use of the word church then as an organized structure begins to feed into our individualism for when we see the church as such a structure it just becomes another organization designed to meet our needs rather than living people with whom we journey until Christ is formed in us becoming the hands and feet and face of Christ and then we begin to think that boy I am going to even use language like I will quote attend a church because a church is just an organization. But in the right sense of the word, how do you attend people? We attend church. And finally from there, we end up choosing to attend a church based on the perceived products it offers. The distortion is complete, and the list of possible consumer-oriented reasons to attend a church becomes endless. Let me give you some examples. Some of us might go to church because we like the style of worship. How many church fights have come over the use or the non-use of the organ? Dan Adler, the former worship minister here, used to tell stories of people coming up to him after the service. And there'd be this long line right in front. And one after another, people would come up to share their thoughts with Dan. And it usually went something like this. Dan, there needs to be more hymns in the service. And then the person would walk away. And the next person would say, Dan, there needs to be more choruses in the service. And back and forth and back and forth, it went as the people coming forward were demanding of an organization a product that would meet their needs. Another example, we go to the church because of the preaching. Now, of course, I want to like the preaching in the church I go to. I love the preaching here, especially today. Let's ask a hard question, actually. Get serious for a second. and real practical. If, hypothetically, and by hypothetically, I really mean hypothetically, for I have no inside information, nothing driving this, and if this was ever taken out of context, I would get in real trouble. But if, hypothetically, Dave was ever to leave this pulpit, hypothetically, how many of us would stay? You see, the answer to that question determines whether or not we see Dave as another member of this community of faith with whom we journey to Christlikeness, or if we somehow depersonalize him and see him and his preaching as another product to be consumed to meet our needs. Quite frankly, five or six years ago, if I would have seen my name listed next to the word message in the bulletin, I probably would have left that service. As a matter of fact, and I'm not proud of this, I did leave. on a number of occasions when it was someone other than Dave who was preaching. I was an individualistic consumer out of a product, not a person who is journeying with the people of God who are open door. There are, of course, many other individualistic questions we ask when we perceive of the church as an organizational structure only. Is there a singles ministry? Is there a young marriage group? Is there a group for young families? How about a group for support for divorced families? Small groups, groups for older adults, for empty nesters, for single parents, for families with two cars, two and a half kids, and a dog named Fluffy. What about the kids program? Where will my youth fit in? Does the church have a strong outreach program? What is its stance on this issue or that? Are the sermons topical or do they go through a book of the Bible? Is there overseas missions? Do they say the Lord's Prayer during the service? does it meet in a gym will it move close to my home can i wear shorts does it have air conditioning think of how many people we've kept out of here over the years because of that one does it look like my old home church does it have a cross in front will they have pews or theater seats and if theater seats will they have cup holders so i can put my caribou somewhere while listen to Dave. I'm all for that one. Of course, on the list goes. Now, are such things bad or wrong? No, of course not. Is it bad or wrong to want them or even be wondering about them as we're thinking about joining a community of faith? No, except for maybe the cup holders. Is Jesus against organizational structure? Of course not. But when we put such things into the primary places as to why we would join a community of faith, and we would leave if they are not present, then I think we've turned the church into an organization that offers products for us to consume, rather than people of God with whom we journey on the mission towards Christlikeness. We're no longer the hands and the feet in the face of Christ. We're just another consumer. You see, to me, choosing a church requires a sense of call to the people, because the people are the church. Choosing a church does not have to do with being happy with a particular product. People often say open door suffers from a lack of community. I wonder if this has to do more with the fact that many of us here came for individualistic reasons, myself included, reasons that keep us here because of a certain product, not because of the people that we feel called to. You see, coming for a product will always and forever leave us disconnected. Well, rest easy for a second. I am painfully aware that this sword of individualism cuts both ways. For the leaders of churches, myself included, can fall into this trap as well. And the people of God become looked at, rather than the hands and the feet and the face of Christ, they become looked at as some sort of market share to be gained, rather than the people with whom we journey until Christ is formed in us. Let me give you some examples to which, unfortunately, you can probably relate. Believe it or not, decisions as to how church life is arranged often begins with market research. Target an audience. Advertise well. People want lively worship, so we offer it, because it's what the people want, and that'll draw them into our doors. People want homey relational environments, so we create coffee shop churches designed to meet their needs. People want a, quote, alive church, whatever that means. So we put up billboards which say, a church alive is worth the drive. I've seen church leaders agonize over what to put outside on the church sign, because they know it's part of the marketing tool. Now, one of my favorite examples of this dynamic is something that I encountered when I was learning about preaching in seminary. All of the market research said that more than anything else, the people want sincerity in their preaching. So the big message for us was to act sincere. How does one act sincere? You either are sincere or you're not. It's like saying that you should act tall. You're either tall or you're not. platform shoes don't make you tall and eye contact with a certain tone of voice doesn't make you sincere one final example recently church conferences have put great emphasis in research on categorizing generations according to their articulated needs so we have boomers and busters and builders generation x y and z x1 y squared whatever and we feel that if we can know them and target them well We'll draw them into some organization called the church, and we'll build our numbers, and the market share has been gained. Don't get me wrong. We need such research insofar as it helps us understand the culture. But the goal is not to get people into some organization called the church so that we can have a higher market share. The goal is to introduce them to the living and breathing reality of Christ in us so that when the people next to us in the restaurants and in our family and on the airplanes and our neighbors, when they encounter us, they're encountering Christ in us, the people of God, and they walk away, saying with 1 John 1, 1, I now have seen Christ with my eyes, and I have listened to him speak. I have touched him with my own hands, and I know that he is the message of life. If market research leads us to that, great. Otherwise, throw the rest of it away. So where do we go from here? How can we recapture the essence of the church? I mean, things can get pretty bad when we begin to blend the church and the culture, losing our sense of identity. Well, for me, I have to go back to the starting point once again to receive some clarity. The starting point is this. The church is God's people. and God's people are called to be the hands and the feet and the face of Christ to a world filled with vacant stares and hopeless hearts. As the extension of Christ, who is the light of the world, we become the light of the world as well. So with that as my starting point, with this as the only identity of the church, I can now ask another question. So what does that look like, to be the hands and the feet and the face of Christ? What does that even mean? It sounds good, but how does it even work? Well, all I could think to do was to give you some stories in which I have seen the hands and the feet in the face of Christ made known. And I'm hoping that in these stories, we'll catch glimpses of what it means to be the church. First, I know of teachers who spend the mornings in their classroom before the students ever arrive. They spend their mornings going from desk to desk to desk, and they just pray for each one of their students. Students might never know. The teachers might never be able to say the name Jesus in their public school classroom. But I can promise you that those students are catching glimpses of the eyes and the hands and the face of Jesus when they're in their school room. I know of another story. Some friends of mine were finishing their basement and they decided that they were just going to host a movie party for their entire neighborhood. So what they did is they hauled up a couple pieces of sheetrock from their basement, set it out in the yard, got a movie projector, rented some movies, and just invited the entire neighborhood over for dinner and for the movie. Now, they didn't hand out little four spiritual law booklets, nor did they have an altar call between features. They just extended kindness to their neighbors, something that doesn't happen much, something that just may prompt the neighbors to say, what's different about you? Why? Why? Why? I think the neighbors can catch a glimpse of Christ. I've talked with a business owner recently who is asking himself the question of what it would mean to have his printing business be an extension of Christ. Hard question. And I've watched another business owner of a manufacturing plant who over the last 30 years has used his business as extending as much time and effort and energy and money as he can towards kingdom pursuits. And when people see him, they see Jesus with skin on. That's the bottom line for this company. It wasn't whether it was black or red in terms of the money. The bottom line was, do people see Jesus? Because this person sees themselves rightly as the church, the hands and the feet in the face of Christ. And they're regular people. No seminary degrees, just people being the church. Could be any of us, doctors or lawyers, factory workers, business people, mothers or fathers, students or auto mechanics, anyone who has the life of God in them, or the church, the extensions of the hands and feet and face of Christ. I know of two homemakers some 17 years ago who began to be gripped with compassion for the inner city, specifically the people of the inner city who are broken and lost. Sensing the call of God, they became connected with an inner city ministry in Chicago, and they offered what turns out to be an incredible gift of cooking. It was a ministry in a horrific part of town. As these two homemakers became involved over the years, the church began hosting a week-long harvest festival in which they would offer food and social services to the communities to draw them in, and then they could share with them the message of Christ. The festival just exploded with hundreds of people coming from all around, off the street, from broken-down houses. There were convicts and prostitutes, gang members, absentee parents, parentless children. They were coming by the dozens. There was good news. There was so much food needed over the years that the two homemakers, who again, just offered their gift of cooking, whatever way they could, well, they ended up having to start their own catering company. And they catered weddings throughout the year. And using the proceeds from what they had developed throughout the year, they purchased and provided all of the food each week for this harvest festival. Regular people. Could have been any of us. Pretty soon, over 50 women and men and teens from these two women's home church, which was located in a wealthy suburb, decided to go down with them. There's something about the life of God that is captivating and draws us in. So they went down, not know what to expect, and what they found changed their lives. so from two regular people offering whatever gift they had out of a sense of call we have both hardened criminals and wealthy suburbanites finding Jesus it's incredible could have been any of us one last story and I tell this story because even though it is a simple everyday kind of story it is very personal to me and has been a significant part of my journey around this issue of even thinking of myself as the hands and the feet in the face of Christ. A few years ago, Hallie and I lived in an attached townhome community. And we lived next to a neighbor, a woman probably in her 40s, with whom we just couldn't seem to get along and quite frankly didn't care for much. Our first interaction with her came early on a Saturday morning in which she knocked on our door and proceeded to ball us out for parking on her side of our shared driveway for a minute or two the night before. It was all downhill from there, with most of our arguments revolving around the driveway, of all things. She would glare at us if we even stepped on her side, and we would glare back. I remember one specific instance in which we were shoveling our sides of the driveway. We were doing it at the same time, and I was using an ice pick to hack up the frozen surface of my side of the driveway, and then I would shovel what I just hacked up. And at one point, I put the ice pick down, by accident, on her side of the driveway. Well, she walked down the length of her driveway and gave the ice pick a swift kick, sending it spinning down the driveway and into the street. She said something that I don't remember. It's probably good that I don't. Now, being the spiritually mature, budding pastor that I was, well, I just laid into her. I yelled about what a jerk she was and that I'm not really proud of this but I began making up stuff about how the city actually owns our driveway so stop yammering about your side my side, it's nobody's side and I stomped off inside unfortunately as God is prone to do in such instances, God showed up and he didn't show up at my neighbor's house but in the hard work of beginning to interact with God he started cutting me to the quick about what it means to be his hands and his feet and his face of Christ to the world as I interacted with God in the hard work of even repentance around that he began to break my heart and in that brokenness I walked over and offered a sincere apology didn't even have to act sincere. As I spoke to her, I watched her eyes move from anger to surprise to a certain amount of softness in the course of just a few seconds. From that moment on, our relationship was different over the next two years. We occasionally shoveled our driveways at the same time, and sometimes I shoveled hers and she shoveled mine. And over time, we began to talk, and she shared part of her sacred life story with me. She began to share that her husband had left her just recently, and that she had lost both of her parents within the same year. She also had an arm disability, which was preventing her from holding a job. So all of this just driveway bitterness, this outward expression that we so often just choose to get angry at, and without seeing into people's souls, that driveway bitterness was just a manifestation of pain inside of her. As I listened to her story, I began to rethink my perspective on the world. What does it mean to be the hands and the feet in the face of Christ here? Now on one particular occasion, she shared with me that it was her birthday. And I said congratulations and asked if she was going to have a big shindig that evening. She said no, her parents had passed away. And though her sister might be coming over, she didn't really have any friends to speak of. So I shared this with Hallie and we decided to bake her a cake and have her over on our patio for a makeshift birthday party. Reluctantly, with tears in her eyes, she came over And during that time, simple story, her life just connected with ours And ours with hers We sang happy birthday to her Didn't sound very good But she couldn't stop talking about how much she appreciated this She told us other things about her life And we shared ours with hers as well She talked about how she was getting connected with a local church body And we just encouraged her to do so As we talked, you could see her spirits lift, and there was life coming into her eyes. I believe that on that day, she saw Christ in Hallie's face and in my face. I believe she saw Christ in us. I was transformed and convicted by how I don't even ever think of myself as the hands and the feet and the face of Christ. And if all it took was a simple act of love to connect with the pain and brokenness of a hurting world, a hurting person, the person sitting next to us, the person in our family, the person that will walk into our job tomorrow, if that's all it took, then I do believe there is hope for the church. For it doesn't take a seminary degree. It takes regular people, teachers and homemakers, factory workers and doctors, lawyers and business people, students and parents who have the life of Christ in them to begin seeing the world rightly and seeing the people around us rightly, all of us rightly, and just say, God, I don't know what it even means. There's so much inside of me that is so sinful, but God, transform me that I could be your hands and feet and face of you to the people that are around me every single day, people filled with vacant stares and broken hearts. What would that mean for Church of the Open Door to be marked that way? Instead of just another church where we gather together and we offer products to be consumed and we hope that we gain a market share. What would it mean to be the eyes and the hands and the face of Christ to the world and thereby reestablish the identity of the church? I'd like to pray as we close. God again I pray that this message will have been filled with grace but filled with truth as well that we as a community of faith learn what it means to journey together in this pursuit of Christ likeness that we can be your hands and feet and face form that in us God make us that kind of people that when people encounter church the people of open door they encounter you your hands and your feet and your face and they say something is different there is new life here and it calls them in out of their hurting and brokenness and into how we sing almost every week a new kind of life life of hope and peace and joy let us not keep that for just ourselves pray these things by the power of your spirit Amen Amen.
