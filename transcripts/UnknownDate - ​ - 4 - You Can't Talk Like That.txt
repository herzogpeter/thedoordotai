Father, we just ask that the power of your Spirit would be here right now and bring your anointing to this time of teaching as we go through the book of Job. And we consider again his responses to his pain and his despair. And I pray that you would use this again to equip your body. First of all, to deal with our own despair in honest ways and also to give helpful help to people who are in pain. We just pray that your spirit would move among us with power and freedom. In Jesus' name, amen. I think you're aware of the fact that this is a class called Dealing with Despair. The aim of the class from the beginning has been, number one, to be helpful to those of you who may right now be in different levels, possibly, of grieving or despair of your own. But also, one of the real agendas that we have in a class like this to equip people to be more adept at giving what we would call helpful help to people who are in despair. We don't have the idea that people would come out of this class being ready to be therapists or counselors, but I really do believe that with some of the things we talk about here, that we can be far more sensitive in terms of just being caregivers to people who are in pain. And that's the level at which I think everybody in the body can minister. and we can get better at that. Jeff and I have been splitting the duty on this. My focus has been the book of Job. He has brought some therapeutic insights and psychological tools, I think, that have been real helpful to untie some of the mystery of our grieving processes. But as I said, my focus is just kind of going verse by verse through Job and trying somehow to pick up the drama. The last three classes are going to be that, just the book of Job, trying to finish it up. Just to give you a little bit of review and catch you up to where we are, remember that the book of Job is a drama. And because it is a drama, it's like life. And because it's like life, it isn't always as symmetrical as we'd like it to be. It's a little bit chaotic. It doesn't follow a nice little one, two, three outlining. There are things in this book that are frustrating. There are things that we hear Job say that are scary. But the bottom line on the things he says and the directions he goes and the things we hear him do is that it's real. It's just coming from the heart of someone who's in an enormous amount of pain. A book like this that is a drama and one that's dealing honestly with someone's pain doesn't allow for a lot of easy answers and simple formulas. There are no three steps to conquering despair or dealing with your grief. There are three easy ways to overcome those things. You're not going to hear that in a book like this because I think it's far too real. What we have thus far, in terms of what we've already covered, is first of all, we've dealt with Job's calamity. We've seen the fact that he's lost his wealth in the first chapter, he's lost his status in his community, he's lost his entire family except for his wife, and then the last thing that happened to him was that he lost his health. He's full of boils and enormous amounts of physical pain. We also got introduced last time to Job's three would-be counselors, his friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. We met Eliphaz and Bildad last time. Today we're going to meet Zophar. But what we saw of them, first of all, in chapter 2, was that they came to him, saw him from a distance, recognized that he was in a lot of pain. And because of that, what they did for seven solid days was what? Remember that? They just empathized with him. They felt his pain. They didn't say a word. and there was a lot of good teaching that we got out of that relative to the kinds of things that we need to do when people are in pain. We don't need to fix them. We can't fix them. You can't solve the problem for them and sometimes what people need the most is just for you to be with them and that really confronts sometimes our responses to people who are in pain. I know you do this because I do this. When I see people in pain, I want to go away. I want to go the other way. You can't know how often, especially early in my ministry, when the only person who ever did visitation was me, I would go to the hospital. I don't like to admit this. This isn't a pretty sight, but I would drive around the hospital six times before I could find a parking place. It wasn't that there wasn't a parking place. You don't like it's hard to go and talk to people because you feel like I'm supposed to give them answers. There are no answers. What they need is you. That's what they need. And maybe that's what we're afraid of because maybe somewhere we really do realize that and it's a lot of work sometimes to give them us. That's what they need. Okay, we learned that. And a tremendous amount of therapy and healing happened in Job's heart when that happened. Job got a message from their concern and the message was this. I think these guys really care about me. And then he took a risk and I think the risk was based on this. He said, I think in his mind, if there's anybody in the world who could possibly handle what I really feel, it might be these guys. When he was with his wife, he kind of kept his defenses up, and he even tried to shut her up because she was real hurt and she was real angry, and so he kept her at bay by saying, naked I came, naked I'm going to go, and you just be quiet, you silly woman. And all of a sudden he's with guys who aren't saying a word, and he got the idea that maybe with these guys I could say what I really think and what I really feel, and so he did. And out from him poured a river of pain, despair, disillusionment, and fear. And that was in chapter 3. He literally cursed the day he was born. What he found out was this. It wasn't okay to say what you really feel. Not with these guys. It was a mistake. And what they did in the following chapters up to chapter 11, where we're going to pick up now, is they began to react to his words instead of responding to his pain. Remember that little cliche? Instead of responding to his pain, they reacted to his words. And the ministry changed at that point. And again, that was an important tool for every one of us. When my real concern is ministering to you, I have the capacity to respond to your words and not be threatened by them. When I get threatened by your words, all of a sudden my entire posture with you is going to change because my agenda now is not to minister to you, it's to protect me. And his words were very confusing to them. They didn't fit into these painful words, these cursing the day they were born words were real words. They were how Job felt. They weren't terribly appropriate, but they were real. We have to deal with that real thing. They had no idea how to put that into their little parameters. It upset them terribly. And instead of ministering to Job anymore, they began to protect all of their little systems. They got real threatened, even needing to protect God. All of a sudden, their entire ministry energy was spent trying to shut Job up. Everything they said from chapter 3 on was designed to put the words of despair back in Job's mouth because they were extremely uncomfortable with the language he was using and the pain he was expressing. They were much more comfortable, or would have been much more comfortable, had Job said, guys, thank you for coming. You know, you came here to bless me. I mean, yeah, you came here to bless me and something like that. You're a blessing to me. Isn't it wonderful? Bless the Lord on and on. It didn't happen. The first guy we met was Eliphaz. He was the moralizer. That doesn't mean he's a moral person. A moralizer deals with shoulds. He knows what you're supposed to do. He knows that you should do this. He knows what others ought to be doing. If I were you, I would. You should. He ought. He was a moralizer. Bill Dadd was the oversimplifier. An oversimplifier is somebody who simply has a little formula for every problem anybody's got. If you do these three things, God will do these three things. If you follow these five simple rules, God will follow through on his part and it will always work. The little rule we even saw for him, and they become, by the way, more obvious as we go through this, but the first time we saw it was in chapter 8, verse 5. Job, here's the three things. If you would, number one, seek God. Number two, implore his compassion. Number three, become pure and upright. Surely now he would rouse himself and restore you. Do these three things and God will do this. And if it doesn't work for you, Job, you'll be the first one. He was an oversimplifier. Everything was very clear to him. He had it all figured out. The problem was that Job didn't just get off the boat. He wasn't somebody who was able to buy all of this. And so it was, instead of shutting him up, all of these words that these guys gave him, designed to shut him up, really backfired, and it stirred Job up. It stirred his anger, and he probably came with even more force than he normally would have had they kept their mouths closed. You see, the fact is that Job looked at his life and he realized that all the formulas they were giving him, he had done them. He had done it right. In chapter 1, it says he was an upright and a blameless man. He followed the formulas all his life. He did the good things all his life. and what he was discovering was this they don't work i did it right i still got pain what's the deal he was feeling really ripped off we left him in chapter 9 verse 20 and 24 where instead of their guilt bombing him shutting him up it brought out even more pain we see him coming to some incredibly almost vile things about god when he says in verse 20 i mean he's really angry at this point. Verse 20 of chapter 9, though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me. Though I am guiltless, he will declare me guilty. And I don't have a chance against God. I am guiltless. I do not take notice of myself. I despise my life. It is all one. Therefore, I say, he that's God destroys the guiltless and the wicked. Nobody's got a chance against this guy. If the scourge kills suddenly, he mocks the despair of the innocent. The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of his judges, and if it isn't God who does that, then you tell me who's doing all that. Bad stuff to people. Why do bad things happen to good people? It just happens to everybody, and I don't know why God does that. He destroys the guiltless and the wicked. Everybody's in a mess. Where we left him was asking some very hard questions and making some very hard statements, and where he was actually coming to was questioning not God's existence, but his character. That's how deep his pain had gone. I quoted C.S. Lewis in his book, The Problem of Pain, when he said this, quoting C.S. Lewis here, I do not fear that I am in grave danger of ceasing to believe in God. What terrifies me is my coming to believe such terrible things about him. You see, the conclusion I dread is not, Aha, no God after all, but rather, Aha. So this is what he's really like. He's mean. That's where we left him. Enter Zophar. Zophar is the youngest of the three. Because he is the youngest, he's had the way to last. Because he's had the way to last, it might explain some of his anger. He's been waiting to talk, and now he's got his chance, and so he's going to blow up Job. I want you to note something before I begin to read his speech, and that is this. He's not going to say anything new. When I was in college, I had a football coach who had a little saying. Around Thursday or Friday, we'd ask him, what are we going to do today? What's practice going to be like? And he would always have a stupid grin on his face and say, well, we've got to get MSPHD. What that means is more of the same, piled higher and deeper. What Zophar is going to do is MSPHD. He was just going to give more of the same, piled higher and deeper. The same old stuff, the same old formulas, the same old guilt bombs, the same old motive. Shut Job up. I'm just going to get bigger. It's just going to be more of the same, piled higher and deeper. Let's read it. chapter 11, verse 1. Then Zophar the name of thy answered. Shall a multitude of words go unanswered and a talkative man be acquitted? Shall your boasts silence men and shall you scoff and none rebuke? Aren't you ashamed of yourself, Job? Do you think it's okay to talk like this? Again, his whole purpose is to shame him and get him to be quiet. For you have said, verse 4, my teaching is pure and I am innocent in your eyes. but I would that God would speak and open his lips against you and show you the secrets of wisdom for sound wisdom has two sides. Job, know then that God forgets a part of your iniquity. You get what he's saying there? Again, Zophar's got this little formula. If you do it right, just like the other guys, you'll be blessed. If you do it wrong, you're going to get punished. You're obviously getting punished. And I got a word for you. God has forgotten part of your iniquity. If you got what you really deserved, it'd be worse than this. That's what he's saying. At this point, I'm surprised that Job doesn't start punching people. In verse 13, Zophar goes on and he is way off the mark. He is communicating, whether he knows it or not, that he is absolutely ignorant of what's really going on in Job's life and incredibly insensitive. He says this, If you would direct your heart right and spread out your hand to him, if iniquity is in your hand, put it far away and do not let wickedness dwell in your tents. The problem is this, and again, it isn't always like this, but we know because of the book of Job that Job's problem is not a sin problem. How do we know that? Because the book says so. In the beginning, it was Job is a blameless and an upright man. The reason anything's happening, and by the way, we're going to grapple with the why of this in the very last lesson, but it was something that went on in heaven between God and Satan, and God said, look at my guy, and remember he picked a fight and we got to, oh, I hope he doesn't do that to me. But it has nothing to do, this is not a sin problem for Job. There is a deepening going on in Job's life, and God allowed it for some reasons that we're going to come to grips with later, but the biggest thing you need to know is you don't know why all the time, and we need to be okay with that. We aren't. But Zophar is off the wall with this. If you would direct your heart right, it is obviously, from Zophar's perspective, a heart problem. You've got sin in your life. If iniquity is your hand, put it far away. Do not let wickedness dwell in your tents. He does not get it. This is not a problem of sin. It is a problem of pain. Sometimes there is a corollary between the pain someone's got in their life and sin that brought the pain on. There is not always a disjointedness between those two. Sometimes they're connected. But don't assume that they are always. That's a real dangerous thing to get into. You don't know that. Verse 15, Then indeed you could lift your face without moral defect. I wonder if Zophar thought he could lift his face without moral defect. Who could do that? Well, maybe if you don't let wickedness dwell in your tents, how much would that take? That's incredibly self-righteous. You could lift your face up without moral defect, and you would be steadfast and not fear, for you would forget your trouble as waters that have passed by, you would remember it, just like waters that pass by. And your life would be brighter than the noonday. I hear a song. It's just like Jesus to roll the clouds away. Some of you, that's your favorite song. But you know what? I think a lot of times we try to sell God that way. I think God brings peace. I think God brings joy. I think God brings an abiding sense of life in our lives. But a lot of times we try to sell God. Our evangelism even takes on that kind of flavor. God will make all your problems go poof. He's going to make a big smile go on your face. All of your struggles will be over. He can make you rich. And now you'll be happy all the day, feasting on the manna underneath a cloudless sky. I wonder what the disciples would have thought of that theology, that everything's going to be great. No more pain, no more clouds, no more struggle. Every one of them died a martyr's death. I wonder how they would have dealt with a theology like that. I wonder how the people in Hebrews 11, who after he said, time would fail me if I told you about Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, who by faith conquered kingdoms, put foreign armies to flight, did great things, but others were sawn in two. Remember that? They were ill-treated, afflicted, destitute. They lived in mountains and caves, men of whom the world wasn't worthy. They didn't have anything to wear. They didn't have any food to eat. What would, you know, I thought it was going to make all the clouds roll away. If that's your equation, I think you're going to run into trouble unless you have an incredible capacity to deny reality. Larry Crabb said something at the conference I was at a couple of weeks ago that I wrote on the cover of the book and I think it's true for a lot of us and we struggle with this and that was that he said most sermons that we hear could be entitled this, the Christian formula for victory victory through denial just deny what's going on in your life, deny what's really raging in your soul and slap on a happy face and call that the abundant life. Victory through denial. I had a real good friend in my former church. When I was going through seminary down in the Chicago area, I passed a little church while I was going to seminary. And my wife and I got real close to a couple of couples, and one in particular, the guy's name was Larry. And he was saved in college through a campus ministry. Real effective ministry. But the person that he was dealing with at the point of his salvation, one of the big things that he sold Larry was that as soon as you ask Jesus in your heart, all your problems are going to go away. He's going to solve every issue you've got. Everything's going to be wonderful. Everything is going to be rosy. What that did was, in his later Christian life, it really created problems for him because he wasn't prepared at all for the battle. He wasn't prepared at all for the fact that all the clouds didn't go away. and when they didn't go away, he was posed with two issues. Number one, disillusionment. I thought God was going to make all this stuff go away. See, he had incredible expectations. No more pain. The other thing was, you can either get disillusioned and walk away from the whole thing, or you can start to pretend. No, that's not really a problem, and just slap on a happy face because you're afraid to talk about a problem because if you have a problem, and the definition of Christianity is no more problems, no more clouds, then if I've got a problem, that means maybe I'm not really a Christian, so I can't even say I've got a problem, I can't even say I've got any pain, I can't even say I have any questions, because then my whole Christianity is going to be in question, so I'm just going to be quiet and keep pretending, which creates an integrity problem, which ultimately leads to even worse disillusionment. The clouds don't always go away. Life is sometimes filled with chaos, it sometimes has pain, even for redeemed people. I remember when I was in seminary, hearing the testimony of a young guy. I don't even remember the context. I remember I was in a class of some kind. I don't know if it was a counseling thing or not. But the guy who was speaking was speaking of his own conversion, and he had been saved relatively recently. He was saved out of a very painful background. His parents were divorced. There was a lot of alcoholism in his family. There was a lot of abuse in his family. He had just gotten redeemed. What he said was something that I didn't really even understand at the time, but since then, it's come to be seen by me as a real profound thing and something that was a mark of his life in Christ. What he said was this, I never knew what it felt like to really, really hurt until I became a Christian. I thought becoming a Christian was going to make all the pain go away. What happened was this, before he was a Christian, he had learned in a number of ways to medicate his pain. What do you mean? Was he a drug addict? No, no, no, no. You don't need drugs to medicate your pain. There are all sorts of emotional and psychological ways to just withdraw, medicate your pain, deny, not be aware of what's going on inside you, outside here. And when he became alive in Christ, all of a sudden something else came alive. Some of his feelings, some of his anger, some of his fear, some of his despair, some of his feelings of inadequacy came alive. I mean, it sounds like this weird paradox. When I became a Christian, I never felt so much pain. I thought, who'd want to be a Christian? I remember some time ago when I was preaching through Ephesians, and it said this, even though when we were dead in our trespasses, God made us alive. And I thought, on first hand, if you're speaking evangelistically, why don't you come alive? We want resurrection for you, and come to know Jesus, and come alive in Christ. And who would want to be dead? who would want to be dead we offer you life come and live and i remember even when i was preaching it it wasn't in my notes but it became to me the key to the whole thing it all of a sudden dawned on me i can think of a lot of reasons why people wouldn't want to be alive i have never seen a corpse hurt ever you ever stick a pin in a corpse probably not it's really tacky but think about the picture of that i mean all of a sudden i can think i can think of reasons why people wouldn't want to come to life. Because if you really come to life, I'm not talking about coming to religion because I'm afraid, on the other hand, just like people learn to medicate their feelings and what's really going on inside of them with drugs and denial and all sorts of stuff, I am absolutely convinced I've been in the church too long to not see this, that people use religion and all of their churchiosity to medicate their feelings too. And they just cover up all the real things that are going on inside of them with God's stuff. It isn't God. It's just God's stuff. When people come alive, they live. And there is something about life that's wonderful. You breathe, you taste, you touch, you love, you experience, and you hurt. Part of being an alive Christian is that you breathe, you taste the water of life, you eat the bread of life, you feel the peace of God, You experience the presence and the power of God, and I think also you start coming alive to painful things as well. I do not believe that Christianity is void of pain. It is not. It has the presence of God in the middle of all of that stuff to help me through that kind of stuff. God wants real people, not little things that don't feel anything. We are not machines. Zophar would have loved to get Job to deny all the things that were going on inside of him. And by the way, the things that were going on inside of Job were not good. They were not appropriate. They were yucky and icky and ugly and terrible. But they were there, and there was no way we were going to deal with them by denying them. There had to be some place for him to come out with that. Zophar, when he says, if you trust the Lord, there will be no clouds, is wrong. Zophar, when he says, if you trust the Lord, there will be no clouds, if he is not wrong, then he is a liar. If he is not a liar, and if he is not wrong, at least, at best, a guy like Zophar is terribly out of touch with what is real. Zophar started a fight. What he said was, good guys win, bad guys lose, it's always that way. The good guys have God, and because they have God, they cannot lose. The obvious conclusion is if you have clouds in your life, you're obviously not in fellowship. Verse 20, but the eyes of the wicked will fail. That's just the way it is. And if you're failing, it's because you're wicked. In chapter 12, Job responds. I'm surprised he is well enough to have this much wit about him. But listen to this response. I love this. I mean, this is one of those things you like to use sometimes. Truly, then, you are the people. and with you wisdom will die. You like that? I like that. I mean, after you guys are gone, there's not going to be any wisdom left because it all goes with you. You know, there's a warning in that little verse, in that sarcasm that he nails these guys with. The warning is this. If you come with pious, manipulative, guilt-pushing words to a person who is in pain and is dealing honestly with their pain, expect to get blasted because they don't have anything to protect anymore. They don't have any veneers to hold up anymore. There's no more pretending left. The pain has stripped all of their veneer away. By the way, that's one of the wonderful things about pain. That's why the broken ones are the ones who are desperate for God. All the pain has stripped away the veneer. There's nothing to protect them anymore. So don't come at them with little pious manipulations. They'll blow you up. That is, by the way, why very often churches have no idea how to deal with people who are in pain. Because people who are in pain make noise. The easy answers don't satisfy them. They keep pressing for more. But I think this, and I see that, and that doesn't wash, and that doesn't work, and what about it? And all of a sudden, those people just create all sorts of problems, and we want to shut them up or get rid of them. If you come at hurting honest people with pious manipulative talk, they generally don't back down. And we want to either shut them up or get them out. Verse 3. But I have intelligence as well as you. I am not inferior to you. And who does not know such things as these? I have intelligence as well as you. I am not inferior to you. I'm amazed at how straight he's talking to them. You know what he's saying here? he's saying this please don't talk down to me i am not stupid i am not ignorant don't stick me in this little box that labels me in this little way i i am not without intelligence have you ever been talked down to what a stupid question you've all been talked down to somebody condescends to you it's like they they place themselves by their posture or their use of the language or their tone of voice above you somehow, and now they are going to instruct you. And they've got it all figured out how it is that you are going to respond. They know what you think. They tell you what you think. They know how you feel. They know what your problem is and they start just instructing you. I don't know how you respond to that, but generally my response to that starts in my toes. And it just kind of works its way up. And I speak in tongues. There are not many things. There's no appropriate way to respond when somebody condescend to you. Because if you get angry, it just proves out. Oh, yes, well. You know, they'll just kind of condescend some more. They'll just get a little higher than you. It drives you crazy. I can see myself having an argument with my wife. And we don't have arguments. We have disagreements. Conversations. and as we're going back and forth it would be great this is a tactic I'm sure I'll use tonight sometime if we have an argument about something now Bonnie, you know how you are you recommend that? you know you women are so emotional we men are steady and strong I think you need to control yourself I'd get a control right in the head I'd get a frying pan across the living room No. People who condescend to us don't respect us. That's a fundamental word that one of the reasons it creates anger in you is because it's a fundamental lack of respect. It's a presumption that they know how you feel. They know how you think. They've got you figured out. And I think every one of us resent that. No, you don't. No, you don't. You might have some feelings and you can share some of your feelings and what do you think? Does this thing wash with what you're feeling? But you don't know how people think. You don't know what they feel. But if someone puts you in a little box, tells you how you are, and labels you with a little cage on the label, genus homo stupid, that's you. That's part of what Job is feeling. Verse 4, I'm a joke to my friends. The one who called on God and he answered him, that was me. The just and blameless man. That was me. The just and blameless man is a joke. This next verse is classic. He who is at ease holds calamity in contempt. He who is at ease holds calamity in contempt. This can either go for you to apply to yourself if you've ever done this, or it helps you kind of diagnose why you've had a hard time with people who've come at you with this. But what that simply means is that it's incredible how capable we are of scrutinizing someone else's problem when we don't have a problem. It is incredible how much insight we have into someone else's pain when we don't have the pain. It is amazing how I can figure out your marriage when my marriage isn't struggling. I know what you're supposed to do. It is amazing how much I know you're supposed to do with your kids when my kids aren't going through the pain. It's just wonderful. I have you all figured out. It's incredible the insight I have. That is what this means. He who is at ease holds calamity in contempt. You guys got it all figured out. I wonder what you'd be saying if your body was full of boils. I just wish I could hear your perspective then. I think that's an incredibly important thing to remember when we're dealing with people in pain. Verse 6, I see another truth. Zophar, you come at me and you tell me if you do these things everything will be great and my life will be brighter than the noonday if I would put iniquity away and don't let wickedness dwell in my tents. Verse 14, then everything will be brighter than the noonday. Verse 6, I see another truth. You know the truth I see? And here again is this truth that comes out of the heart of a man who's in pain. I see that the tents of the destroyers prosper. you know where is God destroying the destroyers I don't see that I see those guys prospering and those who provoke God are secure I don't get that that's the truth I see the wicked seem to make it and again he's going deeper instead of shutting him up they're setting him off this is you can probably intersect with this particular principle at a number of levels but I remember when I was a kid, we lived in a place called Melrose Park in the Chicago area. It was a real Italian place, real ethnic, Melrose Park. That's where that was, and you get the best Italian food anywhere. Right near Melrose Park was a place called River Forest. I don't know, every three or four months, it was just kind of a family thing to do. We didn't have any money, so we'd go for rides, and we would drive through River Forest. River Forest had homes that you wouldn't believe. I mean, they rival anything you'd see in Beverly Hills or Bel Air. Huge mansions, palatial places, yards that are massive, big fences around them. Gangsters live there. We used to drive by Tony Accardo's house. Add us Tony Accardo. If you drive in there, you're going to get shot. It's great. Why do the wicked prosper? I remember as a little kid, I never read this stuff. How come we live in this piece of junk over here and they live over there? What is that? That's what Job is coming out, only now he's not a little kid going, that's a curiosity. He's ticked about it. What is, you're telling me that if I'm doing the right thing, everything's going to be great, and I don't see that. At least now I don't. This formula that it doesn't, it's not always working out that way. Chapter 13, moving on to chapter 13. Chapter 13, verse 1. Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it. What you know, I also know. I am not inferior to you again, but I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue with Him. Guys, I'm tired of talking with you three. I feel like I would like to talk to God, and if He wants to yell at me, that's fine. If He wants to give me instruction, that's fine, but I want to at least talk to Him, because you guys smear with lies. Verse 4, you guys smear with lies, and I am really willing to be confronted about what's going on inside of me. I think Job is saying that here. But I am not helped at all when you guys try to whitewash everything is wonderful. That kind of stuff. I hate that. It's driving me crazy. I can't get to anything that's real here. To smear lies, the Hebrew word there means to whitewash. You are forgers of lies. Some of your translations say that. You are all worthless physicians. Oh, that you would be completely silent. By the way, their whitewashing of everything was their attempt to protect God. We're going to just make it wonderful and everything's great. Oh, that you would be completely silent and that that would become your wisdom. Hear my argument. Listen to the contentions of my lips. Will you speak what is unjust for God and speak what is deceitful for Him? Will you show partiality for Him? Meaning, will you twist the truth about what's real in order to somehow protect God and make it always look like it's equitable? God doesn't need you to protect and say, it always works out right. It doesn't always. Why are you telling me lies to get me to think it's going to be okay? Don't lie to me. Don't whitewash the truth. Let's talk about what's real. Let me talk to God. At least even if I argue with him and he blows me up, he's not going to lie to me. Will you show partiality for God? Will you contend for God? Will it be well when he examines you and you're telling all these lies? Or will you deceive him as one deceives a man? Or will you lie to him and get him to figure that you're right? He will reprove you if you secretly twist the truth. That's what it means to show partiality there. Will not his majesty terrify you and the dread of him fall upon you? God doesn't need you twisting the truth to make him look good. We do this in big ways and some subtle ways as well. I don't know if you ever noticed this, but we do need somehow to defend God and protect Him. It can get as subtle and as seemingly innocent as changing the facts of unanswered prayer. Have you ever done that? You prayed and prayed and prayed, and God didn't really answer the way it did. But in order to kind of prove that prayer works, you changed the facts, and it really did okay. It did not. You know that God doesn't need you to do that for him? And I'm not even sure if we're protecting God or we're protecting us and protecting our belief system in order to prove that this is okay. So we change the fact that that sounds pretty innocent. God doesn't need you to do that. That's whitewashing lies to try to make God look good. Making up miracles. Have you ever been around things where that happened? It's like a miracle that really didn't happen. All of a sudden, it is a miracle, and it didn't really happen that way. But that makes God... God doesn't need that either. That doesn't honor God at all. Phony healings? God heals people. But we don't need to promote things that aren't really happening and say that they are just to make it look like God's moving here. That doesn't honor God at all. Maybe we do that to make us look good. I mean, it comes down to something as seemingly as innocent as inflating numbers of people who come. You know, there was a big joke when I was growing up, and that was, how many people were in church today? Well, you want the real number, or are we speaking evangelistically? Evangelistically meant you counted the feet. When we're dealing with pain, and we're dealing with people in pain, it doesn't help to whitewash everything, to make it all wonderful. to tell him everything. If you do these, it doesn't work. That isn't true. Those are lies. In verse 15, Job determines even if what I'm saying isn't right. And this is a big step, especially what you have to do is admire Job even if you don't agree with what he's saying. If you're really even troubled by some of the words he's using, and I am. I mean, it's hard, some of the stuff he says. But you have to admire him because he is in the face of a moralizer, an oversimplifier, and a guilt bomber. And I don't know if you know anybody like that, but put yourself in a room with the biggest moralizer you know. The greatest, oh, thank you. The greatest oversimplifier you know. Some of you know someone like, they are very intimidating. And he is basically saying, I am not going to stop being honest. Whether I'm right or not is debatable. In fact, God may blow me up. In fact, God is going to confront him. Elihu is going to confront him. But it isn't going to be the same way these three guys do. And what he says down here, though he slay me, I will hope in him. I am still going to speak, I'm still going to keep talking. Nevertheless, I will argue my ways before him. I am not going to shut up. And I want to argue with God, and I'm not even saying that I'm going to win, but I would like to talk to somebody who's not going to lie to me. I would like to talk to somebody who will fight back with me, not protecting themselves, but will tell me the truth and give me something solid to deal with. I'm not going to be quiet. Even if he kills me, I'm going to keep on hoping in him, I'm going to keep on believing in him, and I'm going to keep on saying what I feel. I'm going to keep putting my cards on the table. Chapter 15, skip up to that. We find ourselves still in the middle of the squabble. Eliphaz, in chapter 15, takes his second punch at Job. This is the second time that Eliphaz has spoken. Again, this whole drama has kind of played itself out. Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. Job has responded each time. Now it's Eliphaz's turn again. And Eliphaz the Temanite responded, verse 1. Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge and fill himself with the east wind? Should he argue with useless talk or with words which are not profitable? Indeed, you do away with reverence and hinder meditation before God, for your guilt teaches your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty. Your own mouth condemns you, and not I. Your own lips testify against you. It's obvious, Job, by the way you talk that you are a wicked man. And this is the way you really are. See, back in chapter 1, we thought you were a blameless man, we thought you were a godly man, but you are obviously wicked by the way you talk. A good man would not talk the way you do. They would not ask the questions you're asking. In verse 12, we can tell that Eliphaz is getting a little bit frustrated because Job is still not being quiet. And by the way, when they aren't quiet, when you start dumping guilt on them, the next thing is that they get angry, and all that is is somebody who's getting bigger to get you to be quiet. And why does your heart carry you away, and why do your eyes flash? that you should turn your spirit against God and allow such words to go out of your mouth. You're getting angry. He's getting angry. Verse 13. Oh, by the way, the thing that he's dealing with there, the flash of the eyes. Where is it? In verse 12. Why do your eyes flash? He's speaking about Job there. His eyes were flashing. And that meant that Job was angry. And it's not okay to be angry. It's just not okay to be angry. You can't do that. That's a bad thing. Verse 13, you turn away your spirit against God and allow such words to go out of your mouth. Again, what's he trying to do? Shut them up. Don't let those words go out of your mouth. It's not about whether it's real or not. I just don't want those words. I don't want to hear them. Put them back in your mouth. I think we've all been in situations where someone has begun to say something. I don't know what the setting could be for you. It could be in a church setting. It could be in a Sunday school class. It could be in a family situation. and we just feel, and it's not about being bad, okay, but it's just the way we are. We're all kind of wanting to keep the peace, only the peace is this outside thing. And you're in this class and everything's going along and people are being pleasant and everybody's giving these nice answers and so we're just kind of going along. Again, it could be, I have a picture of a Sunday school class where everything's going well and all of a sudden there's somebody there who's got pain and they start asking all these questions that don't go with the flow. They just don't have it all nice. And maybe you're in a meeting or something like that, and somebody says something that's filled with pain, or there's some sort of cry of inner anguish, and it's almost as if we physically would like to reach over and put our hand over their mouth and go, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't say that. You can't say that. We learn real early when we're real young not to say what we feel. I mean, we get punished when we say what we feel. And then later on when we get old, we kind of scorn and mock the fact that people play all these little games. But the fact is we learn real easy to play games and not say the thing that's really going on. It's very hard for us to be honest. And I think it is hard because sometimes people, when they start learning to be honest, they use their honesty to hurt people. They use truth to rip people apart. And so there really does need to be a balance. But somewhere along the line, the sickness of holding everything in needs to be done away with. The key word in holding things in is the word repression. Repression. We hear a lot about, I think we hear a lot about, I hear it a lot. Psychologists tell us that repression, simply to repress your feelings, is a bad thing. It leads to sickness. So at least the impression we get from the psychological field is we're supposed to do what we feel and just kind of blow everybody up. pastors, on the other hand, think we need a little bit more repression. Kind of hold it in a little bit, put a lid on things. I'm generalizing in terrible ways, okay? Because not all psychologists say that, and not all pastors say that, but just to kind of get a handle on that. Most of us, I think, would agree that repression is bad, because we've seen the results of repression. It's going to squeeze out someplace. David, when he said, when I kept silent, my body wasted away. The problem is, even though most of us would agree that repression is bad, we don't have a lot of healthy ways to get out what's going on inside of us. Jeff, a couple of weeks ago, I think it was the first week, went over the different kinds of anger that we go through. The three Greek words, that whole thing came out of a study in Galatians chapter 5 when we were going through on Sunday morning, the fruit of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience. Remember patience? That's one of the fruits of the Spirit. one of the aspects of the fruits of the Spirit. I remember when we studied that, it was a real interesting Greek word. Patience meant, the Greek word was makrothumia. Makro, it's a compound word, thumia. Makro means long to. Literally, it meant long in the nose, and they had like a picture, it was like a horse or something, long in the nose. I don't know why that meant, what that's about. Long to, thumia. And thumia is a kind of anger. and then you know like we had this uh we've all grown up and there's three greek words for love well there's three greek words for just about everything and there's three greek words for anger and thumia was a kind of anger and thumia was explosive anger and what the fruit of the spirit is is that we're long to explosive anger it means it takes us a long time to get to explosive anger. The two other kinds of angers were paragasmus and orge. The problem is that for most of us Christians, and okay, paragasmus, again, you've heard this already, but paragasmus is not explosive anger. Paragasmus is seething, bubbling, boiling anger. It's right here, you know, but it doesn't come up. It doesn't come up, and you just kind of hang on to it, hang on to it. Orge is a kind of anger that is simply the result of something that I'm committed to being violated. When Jesus got angry in the temple, it was orge. And it was explosive. It was violent. But it was because something that he was committed to got violated. And orge is not a bad thing at all. In fact, it helps you understand. There are little flags to you. And Jeff went over this. They help you understand what you're really committed to. I may say, these are my commitments. If you want to find out what you're committed to, let somebody blow something up that you're committing. you find out. You just get orge right now. And then you can kind of use your response to learn and grow and go, whoa, I'm way too attached to that thing. Because when they hit that thing, I went nuts. I'm way too committed to myself because when they said something about me, I went nuts. Okay? That kind of thing. It reveals your commitment. But let me just kind of deal with these two. Paragasmas as it relates to repression. Paragasmas is this bubbling, boiling, seething. The fruit of the Spirit is makrothumia, belong to explosive anger. I am convinced that most of us Christians, in order to belong to anger, do paragismas. Do you understand? We hold it in, we hold it in, we hold it in, we hold it in, we hold it in. Are we not angry? No, we're angry. Are we at peace? No, we're not at peace. Is really everything okay? No, everything's not okay, but we're not thumas, so we're being long to thumas, and then we call that patience. That's not a fruit of the Spirit. That's a fruit of repression. That's a fruit of denial. That's a fruit of stuffing all your feelings. The fact is this, paragismas, this bubbling, boiling, seething, and stuffing your feelings, and not dealing honestly with them, and bringing you my feelings when they're appropriate. See, when you do something, it would make me angry. On the initial level, I think it's always manageable. It always is. You know, that really hurt my feelings, that really made me angry when you said that, and I'm not, you know, here to blow you up or destroy, but let's just talk about that and deal with that, and I need to get this kind of out here and talk about it. Where it gets destructive is when I stuff it, keep the happy face, oh no, that didn't make me angry, oh no, no, no, no, no problem. Stuff it, stuff it, stuff it. You know what happens, as I stuff it, you even forget about the connection. You really do quit being angry to the person. The feeling doesn't go away. You just stuff the feeling. The connection with that person goes away, and you add it all up. Jeff was here, and he was looking for objects. Remember that day? He was looking for objects to pick up because we pick up this thing, and this is this little interchange I had with you, maybe. And, oh, no, no, no, I'm not angry. No, no problem here. I just stuff it, and that just stays there. It doesn't go away. And then I add another one, and I add another one, and I add another one, and pretty soon I get a whole armful, I have no idea where all this anger came from anymore. I mean, it could be a life of anger, of stuffed feelings. And then my kid spills the milk. Ba-boom! They get the whole shooting match. Or the wife, or the dog, or whoever. And the whole time, we're calling this paragusmas macrothamia. I'm long to anger. It took me 20 years. then I killed 12 people at once that constant stuffing what's real is not a godly thing it results in a foothold for the enemy it results in a place where the enemy can land and do some of his greatest damage in our marriages, in our relationships and our personal lives. It's an incredible robber of joy. Job was not saying appropriate things. I am not, and I don't want to be defending what Job said. I am defending the fact that he had to say it. He had to say the junky stuff in order to get healthy. Blessed are those who mourn. Remember that? And blessed are those who get out here what is in here. Blessed are those who get out here what is in here. Next question. Is it really good to be totally honest, though? You know, I mean, let's everybody be totally honest with everybody. There wouldn't be anybody left here. A lot of times, people start being honest in order to hurt. People start being honest in order to just put other people down. I think a lot of times we have to discern whether some of the issues we're going to dump on somebody else are really theirs or mine. Because some of the things that make you angry, they aren't about you at all. Some of them are about me. And I need to do my inventory about why was it what she said or he said made me angry. And I'm not going to come every time you do that and say, you know, you really made me, as if it's your thing. Sometimes I want to dialogue it. But sometimes I need to do, so it's not like every time you have to do that. But if you're not dealing with the reality of that yucky thing, then you're going to end up sick. that's the truth the truth is I think however you do it even if you don't do it right even if you do start going to people inappropriately and let's say it's even kind of messy and you hurt some people I would still go out on a limb and say that's still better than holding it all in even if you do it wrong it's still better to get it out where somehow the Holy Spirit of God and the light of the word can get on it where healing can potentially happen because if it stays in here, the only one that can get to it when it stays in here is the enemy. I shared with you last time we met with the fact that in my family, we went through a real hard experience when I was in late high school, that I grew up in a family that was very much dominated by a rule formula mentality. I think it was kind of the spirit of the age. I think most of us, if we were in an evangelical home, we grew up with kind of a quasi-spirituality, legalism. And the home I lived in was like that. In my late high school years, my two sisters, as I mentioned to you last time, went through a real public and painful rebellion. It shook all of the little formulas right to their foundation in our family. And one of the things that happened between me and my dad was very significant in that context. My dad was a pastor, as you know. He had given counsel to many people, and so this was especially humbling and breaking for him. And God did break him, and I think the reason I have grace in my pores is because I saw grace extended to him, and then he began to extend it in our church. What I remember, like it happened today, was a particular incident that my dad had with me in his office in the house. They had a little office in the house downstairs. And he brought me down there one day, and it was in the middle of all the tension and the pain, and I had some real issues with one of my sisters, and she'd been living in the house, and a lot of junk was going on there, and they were sorting through all sorts of stuff. And because they were having to deal with her so much, a lot of us other guys, I mean, there are five kids in our family, so some of us were kind of put on hold, and it was at some crucial times in my life when I needed mom and dad and all that kind of stuff. And he brought me downstairs, and he sat me, and I'll never forget, he looked me right in the eye, and he says, I want to know how you're doing. How you doing? And I thought, you do not want to know how I'm doing. And he kind of pressed me. He says, I want to know how you're really feeling. And I didn't do that. Inside I was going, there's no way you want to know how I'm really feeling. What you want, at least the pattern in this family, is what you want is for me to say, everything's great, everything's wonderful, I'm just trusting the Lord. what you want is for me to say a nice thing. There's no way you want to know the real thing because the real thing is puke. The real thing is terrible and you don't want to hear the real thing. Every time I come out with the real thing, you know, we get slapped upside the head. So that's baloney. Don't tell me you want to hear how I'm doing. I didn't believe him. He pressed. I don't know how it happened. I'm sure there was a process that by the time I got to that, some things had changed in our family. And he pressed and he said, I want to know how you really feel and don't blow smoke in my face. And I remember slowly coming out with some negative things. You know, yeah, I don't know, it's kind of cruddy. Kind of testing the water. And then it came out a little bit more. And then it came out a little bit more. And then it came out a little bit more. And slowly I began to get the feeling that it was okay to say this stuff. And it came out a little bit more. And I began to spill some of my inner stuff. And from an incredibly big reservoir, bigger than I ever knew at the time, of fear and anger and insecurity, came a waterfall of anger and hatred mingled with love and confusion and admiration. And it just came pouring out. And I was with my father, the pastor. And I was swearing, and I was being very inappropriate. And what I remember was that he didn't go away. And I remember that I didn't say anything appropriate. I didn't say any good things. It was just like an avalanche of yuck. And he wept, and I wept. And you know what we did? We sorted it out. This is garbage. Boy, that's garbage. That's puke. Boy, that's not true even. That's not right. Get that out of there. But as long as it wasn't here, it was all true. It was never going to change. And there was nowhere to go with it. And I literally vomited emotionally all over him. I remember feeling at the time, And in subsequent meetings with him since then, felt a question. You've got to picture this as a sophomore in high school doing all this. How can he do that? How can he sit there and hear all that junk without correcting me? Again, that stuff gets corrected all your life. And I remember feeling like he was really big. Like he was really a big person. I think we would do well to see how big God is. that he sees our pain and he knows what's going on on the inside of us and we cram it down and we slap on smiles and we cover our real issues with cliches and the only possible way for us to get the inner healing some of us need is to get some of it out. If it isn't there, don't do anything. I mean, don't feel like Let's have a big vomiting session. Don't make things up. But if there has been that life of repressing and pretending, you will never enter into the joy of the Lord. You'll never enter into intimacy because your whole relationship is play-acting. It's this way you've learned to behave, not relate. You've not learned how to relate. Job is saying very inappropriate things to God right now. But you know what he is? He's nose-to-nose with them. He's probably closer to God than he's ever been. It isn't fun right now. People deal with an awful lot of their issues by simply denying them. We deny our fear, our sin, we deny that. We deny bad attitudes, we deny our sadness, we deny our sexuality, we deny our anger. And the problem is, if that's our way of dealing with, if your way of dealing with your sexuality is to deny your sexuality, you know what I can guarantee? Someday it's going to explode. If the way you deal with your anger is by denying your anger, you know what I can guarantee? Someday it's going to explode. If the way you deal with your sin is by denying your sin, someday it's going to get too big for you to hide. It's just the truth. Job 16. After all of As's speech, Job answers back. I've heard many such things. Verse 2. sorry comforters are you all? Is there no limit to windy words? Or what plagues you that you answer? I too could speak like you if I were in your place. I could compose words against you and shake my head at you. Again, this is the kind of thing when you don't have any pain, it's amazing how much you have the answers. You shake your head and if I were where you are, I could come up with all sorts of wonderful answers just like you guys. Verse 9. This is what we have here coming up is simply the description of the despair of a dying man. Verse 9, His anger has torn me and hunted me down. He has gnashed at me with his teeth. My adversary glares at me. Verse 13, His arrows surround me. Without mercy, he splits my kidneys open. He pours out my gall on the ground. He breaks through me with breach after breach. He runs at me like a warrior. I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and thrust my horn in the dust. My face is flushed from weeping and deep darkness is on my eyelids. Have you ever spent time with a dying person? Some of you have and some of you haven't. Some of you have and it's been a real blessed thing. I have been with some older people who died and they went into the presence of the Lord. And again, I wasn't with them daily, but the time I was with them, there was this blessed ushering of them into the presence of God. I had two grandmothers, everybody does. but one of my grandmothers i spoke of her last week i think it was in the third service that i did and i and i shared that she was a lady who was who was really uh an unhappy person and the the message of her life to me was while i bless her and i know she loved jesus and when in the bottom line she understood grace but in her living she never did but the glory was that when she got to heaven she finally got it then the other grandmother that i had on my father's side was a genuinely godly woman. She was a delight to be with. She's the kind of lady who, when I got older, I wished that I could have had her around when I got older, just to sit down and really appreciate her. Because when I was a little kid, you know how you're a little kid, you know, grandmas, you like them if they make you chocolate milk, and that's about as far as it goes, as deep. But she prayed for me. She loved me. She was a godly, godly woman. When she was about to die, she came to our home. My mom and dad took her in. Her death was not easy, sweet or gentle. It was very painful, slow and humiliating. Her body quit working. She was a woman. She was a stately woman. She had a lot of dignity and personal dignity and she was a Bible teacher and just a tremendous lady. But this godly woman in the midst of this slow humiliating death became short. She started getting angry. I never saw that in her before. She was hostile sometimes. Some of it was that her mind was not working as well as it used to. So a lot of it really wasn't her. She began to have doubts about, you know, what is, where is God in some of this stuff. She began to have bitterness, at least, that I had never heard before. And I remember being threatened by all that and wondering, where is Grandma at now? You know, I mean, she was such a godly woman. And now, as if now we know the truth. After some years of getting distance between that event and where I am now, one of the things I see is that there is a blessed privilege for a godly woman to look into the face of Jesus. And I kind of wish, I personally, because I think my parents did, but I wasn't mature enough at the time to do it. I wish I could have ministered to her this way and take my grandmother and give her permission to look in the face of Jesus and say, Lord, I'm really short right now. Lord, I am really angry right now. I'm hostile, and I have a lot of doubts, and I'm bitter. Could you help me sort it out? Instead of, how can you be like that? Rather, letting it out and saying, God, can we sort this out? I don't feel good about this. What a tragedy if at times like that, which are opportunities for incredible intimacy. We get so threatened by it, though, and so we shut them up. But there are opportunities for incredible intimacy. What a tragedy if at times like that we felt like we had to hold it in or we were shut up by somebody else. And see, the real sick thing is that that's where Satan can use it because the doubt doesn't go away, the bitterness doesn't go away, the anger doesn't go away by pretending it's not there. Right now, if we were to just stop in our whole study, how would you evaluate Job's relationship with God? Would you call it bad? It's a bad relationship. Is it struggling? He is not exactly a pillar of strength right here. He is not mature if our definition of maturity is always being on top of things. After all, he sounds like he's being very disrespectful. But as I've said all the way through here, what we need to see is while he looks like he's being very disrespectful, I don't think there's any distance between him and God. They're nose to nose. Job 17 and 18. Got to keep moving here if I'm going to get as far as I want to here. Job 17 and 18, the argument just continues. Same old stuff. I'm not even going to read anything out of there. The three friends keep screaming their same theme. Good guys always win. Bad guys always lose. The bad guys are punished. The good guys are vindicated. Job kept screaming, that's not true. I see a different truth in my life. Chapter 19, Job skids into a pit. And I think we're going to stop at this one. He skids into a pit. And you just need to feel this. Verse 2, it's almost as if he's past fighting. We've kind of seen Job spitting things out and thrashing back and saying stupid things, but also saying very insightful, discerning things and just thrashing. And now he's going to come to a point where he really runs out of fight. And that happens to us. How long will you torment me and crush me with words? Verse 7, behold, I'm in chapter 19. Behold, I cry violence, but I get no answer. I shout for help, but there is no justice. Verse 9, he has stripped me of my honor. Verse 11, he has kindled his anger against me and considered me as his enemy. His troops come together. They build up their way against me and camp around my tent. He has removed my brothers far from me, and my acquaintances are completely estranged from me. My relatives have failed, and my intimate friends have forgotten me. Those who live in my house and my maids consider me a stranger. I am a foreigner in their sight. I call to my servant. He doesn't answer. I have to implore him with my mouth, meaning I have to beg my servant, whose job it is to wait on me, to wait on me. I've got to beg him to do that. My breath is offensive to my wife. I am loathsome to my own brothers. Even young children despise me. I rise up and they speak against me, meaning they mock me. All my associates abhor me, and those I love have turned against me. My bone clings to my skin and my flesh. I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth. Verse 21, pity me, pity me, oh my friends, pity me. No more fight. I am done fighting. Picture in my mind that I'd like to recreate in you is that he's falling into a pit. All those words, the kids don't like me, my breath is offensive, he's adding up all the stuff. And all of that stuff added up, picture him falling down a pit. Whoa. Okay, adding all the junk up that nobody wants to be around him. My skin clings to my bone. Pity me, pity all my friends. Hear a thud. Boosh, he hit the bottom. I see dust coming up around him, and he's just laying there. The friends are gone. Nobody's around. I don't have any fight left. I don't have any arguments left. All I want is pity. Somebody needs to pick me up. In my mind, I think it's important that between verse 22 and 23, I even have written here, a pause, a pause. What happens here is as he hits bottom and the dust begins to settle, something snaps in Job. Again, nobody else is around. And out of this incredible pit comes the music of the Messiah. Out of this incredible death-like pit come words like the Hallelujah Chorus. And as these things begin to dawn on him, it's as if his eyes open up and he says, wait a minute, something's just dawned on me. I've just remembered a truth. And when I'm in the middle of my pain, I don't remember this truth. And I know that when my pain and the reality of it comes back to me, I'm not going to remember this truth. So what I'm about to say, I want you to write down. Oh, that my words were written, verse 23. Oh, that they were inscribed in a book. It's not good enough that what I'm about to say just gets written on a piece of paper. I want you rather to write them on a book. No, I don't even want you to write them in a book because a book, it could fade away. The pages could fade away and I wouldn't be able to read them. So I want you with an iron stylus and lead. I want them to be engraved on a rock forever. Here are the words that I know to be true even though my pain sometimes dulls the reality of this. Here are the words that I know to be true. I know this for sure. I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last He will take His stand on the earth, even after my skin is destroyed. Yet from my flesh I will see God, whom I myself shall behold, and whom my eyes shall see, and not another, my heart faints within me. Write it on a rock. Write it on a rock. Because I'm not going to remember this tomorrow. Again, my pain is going to come back, and I'm going to have a place, and I'm going to need a place where I can go and look and see this truth that is not going to change. I know this for sure. My Redeemer lives, and He will stand, and so will I, and I don't feel like that right now, but that is the truth. And for some reason, in the bottom of the pit, that truth dawned on Him again. Even through the pain, torment, loneliness, and anger, even through raging questions and doubts about if God cared at all, came a truth, as for me, I know my Redeemer lives. And you know what? I don't know anything else for sure. That's an interesting statement, too. I don't know anything else for sure. I don't know for sure that I'm going to get well. I don't know for sure that I'm ever going to have a family again. I don't know for sure that I'm ever going to have finances or bread. I don't know any of that for sure. I don't know if these friends are ever going to think I'm spiritual. I don't know that for sure. I don't know if the people... Put that for yourself right now, by the way. I don't know if those people who hate me will ever like me. I don't know if these kids are ever going to come back. I don't know if any of those things that are just really causing pain in my life are ever going to be resolved. But it's almost as if when you come to the end of all that stuff, and it's all over, and you've come to the bottom of the pit, what do you know for sure? Is there anything you know? There was one thing Job knew for sure. And he also knew that he was going to forget it tomorrow. I even like that about him. He knew he was going to forget it tomorrow, so write it on a rock. I know one thing. My Redeemer lives, and he will take his stand on the earth. He's going to make it all right one day, even if I have to wait to eternity. And I know something else. When he stands, so will I. So will I. I will see him then. I have, by the way, in my office, on my desk, a rock. And on the rock it says, I know that my Redeemer lives. Write it on a rock. Job has maintained his integrity. He has been totally honest about the things he feels. The things he feels have not been good things. He has not said totally appropriate things. But one of the things he's realized in the bottom of the pit is this, that this whimpering, broken man is not what I am. I am hurt and I'm in despair and it's real but I know my Redeemer lives next week we're going to meet Elihu Elihu is going to give wise counsel Elihu is going to confront Job Elihu is going to nail Job to the wall Elihu is going to nail Job to the wall differently than Eliphaz, Zophar and Bildad and next week is when we're going to begin to hopefully get into some of the arenas of real helpful help. We've spent two weeks, and it might even have been frustrating. You know, you've told us what not to do. These are all things not to do. You already knew what not to do. We already do what you're not supposed to do. Next week, we're going to start getting into some of the helpful help. And then the week after that, we're going to start dealing with the why of all that, of all this pain. Let's pray as we're dismissed, okay? Father, we thank you again for the things we learned from this very first book that was penned. Thank you, God, for the honesty of Job. I thank you, Father, that he is a picture for us, not of perfect, appropriate, right answers, but of honest crying out to you with the pain in his heart. I pray, God, that you would, by some of these things, help us to be a little bit more honest about what's really going on inside of us and a little bit more gentle with people who are thrashing through some of their pain, that we learn to hang on to them, that we learn that the words of a despairing man are his wind and gently bring them along and help them sort out some of the ugly things that seem to come flying out of pain and anger and despair. God, I pray that your spirit be released on us as we deal with people in despair because there are many people like that. A lot of people are just kind of medicating themselves, but more and more we do run into people who are, it's gotten to be too much, they can't pretend anymore. And Father, so much we want to be a place and a people who are ministering the healing grace of your Spirit the way you did. So equip us by your Spirit with wisdom that goes beyond us to be genuine healers of people's pain by the power of your Spirit, in Jesus' name. Amen.
