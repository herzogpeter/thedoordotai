We're going to milk that baby for all that it's worth. If you don't have a Bible, you can read it up on the screens. Colossians chapter 3, starting in verse 12. We read these amazing words. Therefore, Paul writes as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, here's what I want you to do. Clothe yourselves with compassion, With kindness and humility, with gentleness and patience, and bear with each other. This is the phrase we've camped on for a couple weeks. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. And forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues, put on love, which binds them all together. and I told you that a couple weeks ago when I was looking at this text I sat in my study and I came to that phrase bear with each other and my honest reaction I told you two weeks ago was no no way because I that sounded very very difficult so I did a little word study that's what you do when you're hoping to find a parachute away from the thing that you don't want to do And the word literally means to stand up as straight as you can and hold someone else up. That was not good news. It also meant to endure. That was even worse news because to endure implies that something is very difficult to you. Thus you have to endure it. And then lastly, the word meant to delay punishment. So think of the person in your mind that you would like to punish. You got someone? The word of Paul is, delay that as long as you can. Bear with each other. So I needed some help from the text if I was going to have a yes toward that. And we found help in Mark chapter 6, this amazing and magnificent story of the disciples coming to Jesus and saying, Jesus, look at all the crazy things we've done. It's so great. I mean, people are actually listening to me when I speak. And I'm healing people through the words that I'm saying and the prayers that I'm praying, to which Jesus said, that is awesome. I want you to come away with me by yourselves for some rest. So they get in a boat and they do that. Then a terrible thing happens. Needy people. see them getting in their boat, and they race on foot to where they're going. I don't know how they know where they're going, but they beat them there. So when they get there, they're met with this huge crowd of need. Has that ever happened to you? You've gotten away for rest, and you're met with incredible, excruciating need, to which Jesus' response is to feel compassion on them and to teach them all day. The disciples' response is to go away and sit there and be hungry until one of them says, one of us has to go to Jesus and tell these guys to get out of here and buy some food somewhere. So they do that. Jesus, tell these people to go away and purchase food in the nearby towns and villages, to which Jesus says this uncompassionate thing we saw. You give them something to eat. And then they're faced with this. Lord we got nothing and it would cost us a year's wages to buy enough bread to feed all these people so where do you propose that we go and get that bread and Jesus says this it's a beautiful question he says what do you have and they say five loaves, two fish. And he goes, give them to me. And so he breaks them. Praise. And then we can deduce, I think, that the multiplying of that food did not happen in that moment, right? Because then it would have been like this crazy Mario Brothers moment of pile of food and then people just would have clamored toward it and there would have been no organizing with 50s and 100s. No, instead Jesus took a tiny little piece of bread, put it in Peter's hand and said, now you go. and so Peter goes out and says here, receive all that I have and then when he went to the next person and looked down at his hands he saw that there was more here, receive all that I have and then we went to the next person there was more so much that there was 12 basketfuls after everyone had already eaten everything. Into which Jesus says, at the intersection of empty and full, I will give you what you need. Then the next week we looked at even more struggle. The very next story, Jesus sends these guys away in a boat again, and then we read that an evening time comes and Jesus is standing on the shore watching them. And what he sees them doing is being caught in a crazy storm. And it says in the text, they're straining against the oars. Remember that? And the wind was against them. And the text is very clear that it says it is evening when Jesus notices this. But it is what? When he goes out to them. Morning. Twelve long hours of this. the disciples getting absolutely pulverized by fear thinking that they will die but into that struggle at just the right time jesus comes with a word and an action and the word is do not fear it is i take courage and do not fear doesn't mean don't be afraid it just means in your fear don't run. And the movement Jesus does, we saw that he didn't pass by, as the text says. To pass by means to come alongside and be present. Jesus climbed into their boat and the wind died down. Jesus absorbs the storm into himself. But the storm and struggle are there to teach us that at just the right time, Jesus comes when you can hear it. And when you can provide space for him to climb into your boat, he comes with a word and with action. So the question that I want to wrestle with today, moving a little beyond what it takes to bear with one another and the struggle that that is, is this. What does it look like to bear with your own story? what does it look like to endure to stand up straight into your own story to delay punishment of yourself as you struggle to receive your own story as you look at the palm branches on the ground we're reminded of a young jewish man who stood on the top of a hill tears streaming down his face, about to enter a city on one day who was cheering his name, and on the next day who would cry for his death. What does it look like to bear with your own story? If you don't know that, I think it'll be nearly impossible to bear with the story of someone else. Now, I'm a part of a little study group that meets several times a year, to which I am indebted immensely for my own soul, but also for some of my teaching. And one of the things that we looked at about a year ago was the story of Abraham. And so I want to read you a couple of chapters of his life because Abraham was a person that needed to learn how to bear with his own story. In Genesis 12, we sort of are led into the story of Abraham and Yahweh said to Abram, just an amazing instance right there, that Yahweh would be speaking to anyone. And the first thing he says is this, Go you forth. Go. From your land, from your kindred, from your father's house, and I will make you a great nation. I will expand you. I'll give you a blessing and I will make your name great and you will be a blessing. Now, in order to capture the magnitude of this, You need to know that Abraham was 75 years old at the time. And go forth. There was no job to go to. You realize that, right? Cargill was not hiring in the next town. When God says, I want you to go, Abraham's next question would have been, okay, my family has never left this plot of land ever. Where am I supposed to go? And then the answer is, to a land I will show you. Well, that's awesome. You're not even going to tell me where to go. Not going to give you a map. Not going to give me a reference even maybe for the next job. No. Go you forth and I will expand you. Go. Don't take your family. I mean, take your family. Don't take your, you know, your extended family. And we read a little bit later on that he cheats a little bit, and he takes a lot. And what does that say? Most of us, even when we're courageous enough to say yes to God, we start doing this. You know, it's like we're running out of a burning house, you know, grabbing our most treasured possessions. I need this, I need that, I need that, I need that, I need that. Okay, let's go. Now I'm going. Right? And the beautiful thing is God keeps working with us, and that's great. Well, 24 years later, we pick up the story, and again, it's just five chapters, but in the life of Abram, it's 24 years. He still hasn't had a child, which would be expanding his family. He did a little work on the side in order to get a child. You know the story, right? That was a euphemism, of course, but it's also part of the story. But when Abram was 99 years old, 90 years and 9 years old, Yahweh was seen by Abram. And that's a very interesting thing, isn't it? Because in Genesis chapter 12, Yahweh spoke to Abram. But in Genesis 17, Yahweh was seen by Abram. What happens in 24 years of waiting? straining against the oars, wind against you. What happens is you learn to see God. Well, Yahweh said to Abram this, I am God Shaddai walk in my presence and be wholehearted. To which we say, great, what's the next verses? Well, it's very huge that Abram is 99 years old when he's giving him this message because this word, walk in my presence, carries with it the reflexive tense, which means that I want you to walk, Abram, to walk consciously. Now, when you walked into this room and took a seat, you were not walking consciously. You may have thought you were, but you weren't because you weren't thinking about walking. You weren't thinking, okay, now left leg, go, step down. I feel that in my soul. I feel okay. Right leg, get up. Sit down. Okay. Now keep going. Go. Go. Right leg, left leg, right leg, left leg, right leg, until you sat down. That's walking consciously. Walking unconsciously is what you do when you have already learned to walk. And most of us are walking unconsciously through our life. Walking unconsciously through our days and through our jobs and through our parenting. and through our friendships. And God says this to a ripe old Abram, 99 years old. I want you to try to start learning how to walk differently, to walk consciously. And some of the Hebrew in there, really the most literal translation would be, Abram, I want you to learn how to walk consciously right to my face. To my face. and I want you to do it wholeheartedly. Now some translations say perfectly. I don't love that translation because it just plays right into the American spirit. I can do it perfectly. I will do it perfectly. Perfectly. Okay, and then you break down about a mile later down the road. Wholeheartedly means, in some translations it could mean completely. Another translation I saw, it meant having been weaned from your mother's breast and moved on? Meaning leaving the comforts of the things that are comfortable and walking into the things that aren't? Walk to my face wholeheartedly, God is saying to Abram as he's 99 years old. So what does it mean to walk consciously to God's face wholeheartedly for us? Well, I think it means this. now look at the mother's face first of all this mother is thrilled because why why yes her baby is learning how to walk and there is no moment more thrilling in the mom's life when she is has a baby that is 15 months old except for if she was given maybe a three-day you know spa vacation. That would be more thrilling, perhaps. But that moment when the baby starts to take her first steps, I mean, it's beautiful. And look at the look on the baby's face. It's a mixture of excitement, panic, fear. I've never done this before. But what happens, what that baby is going to have to do is she's going to have to at some point, what? Let go of her mother's hands and start taking some feeble, weird steps until something else receives her. She's going to have to let go of what is comfortable and toddle out to that place where something else receives her. That's what it is to walk consciously. And God is saying to 99-year-old Abram, this is how I want you to live. And the person on the other end, Abram, as you walk consciously, is me. God is saying. God meets us at the intersection of empty and full, always with an invitation. And in my experience, as I read through the scriptures, the invitation always requires a letting go. In order to be wholehearted, in order to be complete, you cannot get there without letting go of something that is comfortable and something that has given you life, but that is not equipped to give you life anymore. Think about your mother. Your mother was a wonderful life giver for you. But if at the age of 32, you're still looking to her to give you nourishment in life, You are not living wholeheartedly. Now, here's the other thing. The letting go creates space for God to receive a much larger you. I will make you into a great nation. I will make you into a person who has capacity, God says, but you will have to go through the struggle of letting go. And that is the plot of your entire life. There it is right there. Now there was a time in my life when I was 32 years old. It was about eight and a half years ago. And through a series of missteps and mistakes, but also some courageous decisions, this became true of my life. Yes, my wife of seven years and I moved back into my parents' basement. And let me tell you, I remember sitting in my car in the driveway when we just pulled up for the first time with all of our possessions that weren't in storage somewhere in our car, and it was a moment that I had not put on any goal sheet that I have ever made in my whole life. This was not something that I had ever aspired to, and I felt like the biggest loser. I reached over to grab my wife's hand. It was kind of like, you know, well, I guess this is what we meant when we said for better or for worse, right? Well, in this time, I had no job, but I had worked in the church for seven or eight years before that. And I didn't know it when I was working in these churches, but I was on a track of upward mobility in the church. Started off in this little church and worked there for a couple years. Went to a little bit bigger church, got a little bit more responsibilities and worked there. And then I landed at this big church. And it was like, ah, the Mecca. I had arrived. It was really cool, amazing, huge church. And I crashed and burned after 13 months. a shell of myself. I was trying so hard to be accepted there, and I never felt like it worked. My voice was stunted and stilted, and I didn't feel like myself. And so there I was in my parents' basement, and the picture vividly I got of my life at that point was that my knees were drawn up to my shoulders, my arms were around them, I was naked, and there was glass shards all around me. I mean, I was, everything I thought I wanted was not happening. We were in the middle of the first, second, or third year of our journey of infertility at that time. And it was like, okay, Lord, what is going on? And I was having to let go of dream after dream after dream. Well, I finally found this job at this great church. And it really was a wonderful church, but the job I got was this interim job in youth ministry, a job that the person before me was like 20 years old or something like that, or maybe even 15. I'm not sure. And I took the job because the church seemed really cool, but the responsibilities I had were way underneath my skills. and during that time I had to realize I was off the track you know that track I had jumped off and I might not ever get back on it and it was a terrifying feeling so for those of you who know what I mean by that track you need to know that pastors get on that track too And it was in that moment where God, just in a very sweet and gentle but strong way, asked me a question when I was walking into work one day. And I sensed so strongly a question. God said, would you be willing to trade your former job description of being really big and important with a new job description that is to love people? Would you be willing to do that? And in the moment, I just, you know, I was like, my heart said yes. I don't know how, but yes and over the next several months I found myself in my office and there was a custodian there that was very sort of awkward and awkward to talk to but he would walk in my office and you know how this goes when someone comes into your office and it's sort of awkward and you don't really want to talk to him you go like this oh hey but But, you know, through God's grace, I think I learned to turn around and sit down and listen and look. And you know what I found out about that track? It was so much bigger than the track that I was on. Now, some of you may say, yeah, but Steve, look around. Well, I don't know how this happened. but I do know that part of my journey was letting go of some very difficult things and that God expanded me when I did. Now some of you may be thinking, Steve, what I need to let go of is far bigger than, you know, a pastor's dream of becoming big and important. And that may be true. A woman that's recently had a big influence on me is a woman named Paula D'Arcy. She is a speaker and author and writer who, in her 20s, found herself in the car with her husband and young daughter, and she was pregnant with her second daughter, and a drunk driver struck the car, killing her husband and younger daughter. So when she came to, she was lying in the hospital, pregnant, having lost her life. And she tells this story that she just went through months and years of agony. And she ended up in the office of this person that was a real mentor from afar. But this person was a pastor, and she was reluctantly going to meet with him. It was set up from another friend to meet with him, so she didn't really feel like she could say no. Have you ever been in one of those ones? Like, I don't want to hear what this guy has to say, but I kind of have to do it. and she thought she was going to get a big Bible study through, here's what to learn through suffering from this person. But what he said to her, he looked at her right in the eyes and the first thing he said was, tell me your story. So over the course of a couple hours, she just rolled out her whole story of that whole grief. She realized it was the first time that she had really ever said it since it had happened. And then he looked at her and he was old at this time, full of wisdom. He said, this young woman, you have a tremendous challenge in front of you. And she said, in front of me? He said, yes. And that is to discover the purpose of your life. And she said, I knew I couldn't match him, but I'm going double barrels at this guy, Bible study man. She said, listen, which would be a thing. I mean, if you're ever meeting with your pastor, that would be a thing to do. I'm going double barrels at you, Bible study man. That's when we know it's starting to get real. She said, I lost my purpose for life when my husband and daughter died. And then she said, what happened next changed her life. She said, he leaned in, sparkling blue eyes, inches from her face, and said this. you lost the purpose you wanted for your life but there is a larger purpose for you and the reason why I know that is because you are still alive now if you are breathing in and out no matter what horrendous pain you have gone through. God meets you at the intersection of empty and full with an invitation. And as she was leaving this gentleman's office, he said to her, Paula, one more thing. And he said this, the thing you're searching so hard for, you already have. God is in you. So do not fear. It is I. I'm in your boat. That's what the Lord says to you as you're doing the hard work of letting go. Jesus had to do the hard work of letting go. In the garden, Luke 22, we read this. Jesus went out, I love these next two words, as usual. To the Mount of Olives and his disciples followed him and reaching the place he said to them, pray that you won't fall into temptation. And so he withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them. He knelt down and prayed and this is what Jesus prayed. Father, if you are willing, take this cup, this lot, take this fate from me. But not my will. Yours be done. Jesus had to come to the end of himself, the end of whatever dreams that he had. And he had to say, Father, I have a will. I have a desire. And it is not to march down into that city to my death. But you have enlarged me. to enable me to say, your will be done. You have taught me to say, your will be done. And that's what enabled Jesus to say these words as he was dying. Father, into your hands I commit my spirit because letting go creates space for God to enlarge you and then receive this much larger you. Letting go is horrible. It's painful. It requires every ounce of energy and strength that you have. Abraham, when he finally had his son, Isaac, you know the story. The Lord instructed him to go up on a hill and sacrifice his son. Now, you may step back and you go, I mean, I can't even, I can't even, I can't even, no, I can't even picture what that would be like or why God would do that. And I don't know exactly what that says, but what I do know is that it says God is so interested in expanding your capacity for God. That you have to go through things that are extremely difficult. Because letting go creates space for a much larger you to be received by God. Now I want to read to you a beautiful psalm by a person, David, who knew what it was like to let go and be received by a God that made him bigger. This comes from a different translation, so this might seem a little different. I hope it's refreshing. This is what David writes in Psalm 23. And this is a word for you as you are going through the hard process of letting go. This is written from someone who knows what it's like to be received from a God that has enlarged him. You, Lord, are my shepherd. And I will never be in need. You let me rest in fields of green grass. You lead me to streams of peaceful water. For some of you, you need to let that in. All your life has been chaotic mess. The Lord leads you to streams of peaceful water and you refresh my life. You are true to your name. The Lord's name is I will be what I will be. It's a verb. That's the Lord's name. I am what I am. You are true to your name and you lead me along the right paths. What that means is there is a God. God is intimately involved in your life and God will be true to God's name. That's what David learned. The second thing David learned in this is, I may walk through valleys that are as dark as death, but I won't be afraid because you are with me. You have received me and your shepherd's rod makes me feel safe, which that means I will go through things that feel like I am dying, but the struggle won't kill me. And even if it kills me, there is a God who will raise me up. Your rod and your staff, they make me feel safe because they protect me. And lastly, you treat me to a feast. some of you are absolutely starving right now for God's nourishment. And this is what David says. You treat me to a feast while my enemies watch and you honor me as your guest and you fill my cup, my lot, my fate. The one that you gave for me until it overflows. Your kindness, your kindness and your love will follow me, will be all around me, will encompass me, will be in the boat with me all the days of my life. And here's the best part. At the end of the day, I will live in your house forever, Lord. That is written from someone who has been received by God and who has let go. It's also written by someone who knows how to create space that is just for God. Question, what is that space in your life? What is that place? Where have you carved out that's just for you and God? No one else gets in that place. No responsibilities, no duties. You're not a mom, you're not a dad, you're not an employee, you're not a friend, you're not a parent. This is the place where it is just you and the Lord. And it is naked and frightening sometimes. But it is the place between just you and God. A wise person once told me this, one of the most difficult things you will ever do is to construct a space that is only for God and no one else. I want to suggest to you that the place that you create looks a lot like this. Let's go to look at that picture. That is a shepherd hoisting a sheep up on his shoulders as the sun is going down, as hopes are fading, and you gave yourself up for lost. And that shepherd says to you, fear not, it is I. I'm in your boat. That picture reminds me of the parable of the 99 that stay in the pen while the shepherd goes off for the one. You know that one? You know what I believe is the truest thing about that parable? That I am always the one. I'm always the lost one I'm not the 99 that's not the point the point is to recognize that in that lost space where I realize once again I have lost the plot I have messed up God comes out and finds me and that's the space that I create there's this wonderful phrase in Hebrew time and time again Abraham says it Jesus says it in his own way but the phrase is here I am it speaks to a posture where you say God into my loneliest place where I've given up everything that's comfortable and everything that I know gives me life here I am ready for you to come and enlarge me here I am here I stand a wholehearted commitment to you God a wholehearted commitment to leaving my mother's breast and walking toward what you have for me. Here I am. And for the people who are going to have the courage to bear with their own story and become the person that God wants them to become in the world, the space that you create just for God, you will just say over and over and over and over and over again, Lord, here I am. here I am again. Here I am again. And the Lord will enlarge you. I want to invite you to stand up. And breathe in. Breathe out. And we're going to say a prayer together. A prayer that is, I think, very appropriate for Holy Week. It's also very appropriate for any of you who are in the process of letting go and becoming. So I'm going to read this prayer to you first, and then we're going to read it together. I'm going to read it very slowly. And then we'll read it together. In the name of God the Father, Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I gather all the pieces of myself, which I love that picture because it means they're scattered. I gather all the pieces of myself into my heart and I open my heart to you, Lord God. Come into my heart and transform me that I might be your person in the world. now do we have the courage to pray that together one voice one body one people let's pray together in the name of God the Father Christ the Son and the Holy Spirit I gather all the pieces of myself into my heart I open my heart to you, Lord God. Come into my heart and transform me that I might be your person in the world. Amen. Let me pray for you before you go. Lord God, you are the one that expands us, that enlarges us, so that we can receive more and more of you. So into our pain and into our struggle, give us the courage to see your hands outstretched to us as we have let go of the things that are comfortable and allow us to see a picture of your face, us walking consciously, toddling, learning how to walk all over again to your face. And the picture, let us see, God, of your face is that of a mother or a father beaming at us, joyfully receiving us, all the pieces of our lives gathered together so that you can make us whole once again. Make us whole, Lord God. In your name, amen. Thank you.
