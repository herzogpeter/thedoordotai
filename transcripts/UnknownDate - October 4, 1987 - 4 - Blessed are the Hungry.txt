I'd like you to open your Bibles with me to the book of Matthew chapter 5. Matthew chapter 5 verse 6. We're dealing with these weeks with, I'm sure you know, the Sermon on the Mount. It's a sermon that Jesus began after he began his ministry, which was inaugurated in chapter 4. We need to constantly be mindful as we study our text of the context, because it gives us a flavor of what Jesus is really saying, And it adds meaning to it. We are aware of the fact, just in the beginning, before I even read the text, that it all did begin in chapter 4 with the invasion of the kingdom of God. Up to chapter 4, verse 12 through 25, Jesus had been doing a lot of preparatory things, and Matthew was speaking of that. But at this point, it was as if the gun that had been loaded got fired. In chapter 4, verse 12, he says this, Now, when he heard that John had been taken custody, he withdrew into Galilee. you remember that that was almost like a flare that went up in the air. That was the signal to start the ministry. When John was arrested, Jesus knew by divine plan that the inauguration of the kingdom of God was going to come. And so it is that when that happened, he left Nazareth. He left where he was and went to Galilee. And he went to Nazareth, which is in Galilee. And then he went to Capernaum. And what happened was he talked about the fact that that going to Capernaum in Nazareth was a fulfilling of a prophecy. And that was this, that one day a light would dawn. And it would dawn in Galilee of the Gentiles. It would dawn among people who were the downtrodden and the outcasts of the world. And this light that was dawning was not just a little light off in the distance. The light that was dawning that had been prophesied years before was a kingdom. It was not some innocuous little thing. It was a kingdom, and he spoke of that in verse 17. From that time on, he began to preach, saying, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The reign of God has come. We need to understand something about our context and what is happening here when Jesus does this. This is more than a nice way to start your ministry. This is an invasion that starts here. The war has been declared. Satan, I want my turf back. You have had your way to a certain extent, but the reign of God has come. The reign of God has come. And I have come to defeat Satan. I have come to reverse what he has done. I have come to take my turf back. And then he began to look for people who could be part of that kingdom building and he found people like Peter and Andrew and James and John and he said, Guys, I want to make you fishers of men and I want to do with you more than just building some little organization. I want to give you the authority and the power of the kingdom so that you can go into the world and bring people out of darkness into the marvelous light of the kingdom of God and you can bring them from death to life spiritually and you will have the authority of the kingdom. to forgive sin, which has never happened before. And they followed. And then we saw the demonstration of the power of that kingdom in verse 23, when Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in the synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, the good news about the reign of God, and the demonstration of the kingdom's power was that he healed every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people. And the news about him spread through all of Syria. Jesus was a hit. We've been saying that over and over again. And the result was the news spread. And the multitudes came in verse 25. And great multitudes followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan. But one of the points we've been making these last few weeks as we've been going through this text is that Jesus, seeing the multitude and the bandwagon effect, and that a lot of people were coming because neat things were happening, seeing that they were very possibly coming for all the wrong reasons, he backed off all of that and said, when he saw the multitudes, he went up on a mountain, and after he sat down, came to them, his disciples, opened his mouth and began to teach them, these are the things of the kingdom that you really need to know. The people who are really going to be part of the kingdom aren't the ones who are coming for the show. They are not the ones who are religious. They are not the righteous. They are not the well. They are not the put together. They are not the power seekers. they are not the positive thinkers they are the poor in spirit they are the broken in spirit they are the mourners they are the gentle they are the hungry blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are those who mourn blessed are the gentle blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they alone shall be satisfied I want to pray as we begin and then talk about what it means to hunger let's pray I pray for your filling I got a hunger in me today to communicate the glory of this and I know that words fall short I've been changing the words of this sermon over and over again it is your spirit God that communicates the deep things of God that reveals the mystery of the kingdom to our hearts and I ask in Jesus' name and by the authority of the kingdom that you would release your power here so that we would have eyes to see and ears to hear and a mind to comprehend even if words fail the wonder of the kingdom reality and what it means to hunger and I pray not only that we would understand what it means to hunger but God that you would plant in us a hunger for you and a dissatisfaction eternally for anything less than you. We want to be a kingdom people. We want to be a kingdom church. Our desire is not to be a big church, an innovative church, a different kind of church. We want to be a kingdom church. Broken people, mourning people, gentle people, hungry people. Work that in us, in Jesus' name, amen. What does it mean to be hungry? The way we're going to break that down, it's kind of you try to figure out where to start on all of these aspects of kingdom life. And the place I know how to start is just at the beginning by asking that question, what does it mean to be hungry? Let's play around with the metaphor just a little bit. Unlike, you see, some of the other things we've dealt with like mourning and brokenness, I had a little trouble, and so did you, I think, trying to come up with a perception of meekness and brokenness that was really a powerful thing. but I can relate to right off the bat what it feels like to be hungry. I can understand that easily. Literally defined, let me give you the definition right out of the book. A hunger is a driving force. A hunger is a strong desire. Hunger and thirst is a single-minded ambition for something. Whatever it is that I hunger for, I have a single-mindedness about that. I'm going to do anything I have to do to get it. I really want it and I would do anything and pay any price to get it. Hungry people are highly motivated people. hungry people are willing to sacrifice to get that which they hunger for and that which they thirst for they will do what it takes to get it one of the places that this metaphor works for me is in the athletic arena when you talk about somebody who is playing over their head in a in an athletic event whether it be football or baseball and they seem to be performing at a level that exceeds their ability you see that once in a while they rise to the top one of the things we say of that individual or of that team is this. They were really, what? Hungry. They what? They wanted it. They were willing to do anything to get it. They were willing to sacrifice their bodies. They went beyond what they were physically able to do because they were hungry. I understand that. That works. I can relate to this because I see that and feel those things inside of me. When we talk about a hungry football team, you're talking about a coach's dream. Why? Because you don't got to motivate people like that. You don't got to tell them, oh, I hope you guys really want it. They already want it. All you do to people like that is point to them. You say, there's the meat. Go get it. When you're talking about hungry people spiritually, you don't stand in front of them and go, oh, please, I hope you like God. You go, there he is. Go get it. They're hungering. They're thirsting. Nothing else will satisfy. That's what it means to hunger. Blessed are the hungry. Blessed are the thirsty. They alone shall be satisfied. Let's get down a little deeper into the metaphor itself. I know how it applies, and I can think of some things right off the bat in athletic arenas and things like that, but Jesus chose a physical metaphor, a biological metaphor for a purpose, to communicate something I think powerful that we need to understand. When we think of hunger and thirst, it is a biological need. Before we apply to other ways, we need to understand that. Two of the basic human physical needs I have in order to survive is to eat food and to drink water. Without either one of those two things, I will die. I believe that he is using that metaphor to express a sense of desperation about a hungering and thirsting for righteousness. The hungering and thirsting is more than wanting it a lot. It's more than what a football player feels when he wants to win the game. It's what I have to have to live, hunger and thirst. If I don't have that, I will die. it's what i have to have to be okay it's what i have to have to have any sense of satisfaction in my life or fulfillment it is literally my source of life the water i drink the food i eat and if i don't have that i will die therefore i will do anything to get it i will do anything to keep it i'll do anything to protect it i'll do anything to hold on to it it is my life i got another question for you as we progress through this what does it mean to hunger i think you've got a picture of that. The next question is this. What is it that we hunger for? What is it that we're feeding off of? What is it that we have to have and without that thing that we have to have, we could not live? What is it for you? I got a theory that I want to share with you right off the bat here. And it's a theory that I know I'm right about. I believe that every soul, every person, every human being that has ever lived on the planet earth has within him a hunger in his soul, a hunger in his spirit, a thirst inside of him that needs to be quenched. It is a thirst and a hunger. It is a soul thirst for meaning. It is a soul and spirit thirst for value and belonging and purpose in his life. Every person on the face of the earth is hungry. That's why this metaphor doesn't need a lot of explaining. You are all hungry people. The difference between some people on other people isn't that some people are hungry and other people aren't. The difference between people is that some people who are hungry feed on this and some people who are hungry feed on something else. It is common to man. It is what separates us from the animals and every one of us have inside of us a hunger. That hunger of soul and spirit is a true thing relative to someone sitting in skid row. They have within them a hunger. It is also true of a corporate executive who sits on top of the IDS building. Not all the way on top, in his office. But if he was on top, it would be true of him too. That hunger is true of the prostitute on Hennepin Avenue. It is also true of the housewife in Maple Grove. That hunger is something and thirst is true in the life of a rapist in a dark alley. It is also true of the next door neighbor that you wave to every time you go to work in the morning. There's a hunger. And again, what separates us from anybody else and what separates anybody isn't that some are hungry and some are. It's that people are all feeding on something else to quench the thirst and satisfy the hunger of their soul. And that's where the problem begins, having understood that. What we need to understand is that what most people are looking to to quench their thirst and what most people are looking to to satisfy their hunger does not do it. It does not satisfy. It does not quench. And Amos put it this way. I love this. Amos the prophet said this. The world is panting. Get that picture. It's hungry. They're thirsty. The world is panting for the dust of the earth. Figure that out. I mean, people aren't really doing that. Do people really do that? I don't see people walking around groveling in dust. Do you? No, I don't. What Amos is saying there is this. People are panting after life. They have a hunger in their soul, and they're going after all sorts of things to get that satisfied. And they think it's going to satisfy. The problem is, even some of the good things they're looking to to make themselves okay, what they don't understand about those things is that they are dust. Every one of us are hungry. We just eat different things. And some of us are eating a lot of dust. What is it for you? What is it for you? Even as believers, sometimes we get off of feeding off of Jesus as our only source and start looking to other things, even good things, to fill us and satisfy us, and it's all dust. Sometimes the thing we look to to satisfy the hunger in our soul are good things, like a three-bedroom house and two kids and two cars and a dog and a pop-up trailer and a boat. And if I only had those things, I'd feel satisfied. I'd feel okay. And you spend maybe your whole life pursuing those things with a hunger in your spirit, believing that if I had that, I'd be okay. There's a problem with that. Nothing wrong with boats or cars or kids. I love them. But they are dust. They do not satisfy the hunger of the soul. And if you want to know if that's true, find someone who's got all that and ask them. For you, it may not be cars and boats and houses. In fact, you may feed off the fact that you don't care about that stuff because I haven't bought into the American dream. Well, that's fine. Well, let me ask you this. What are you feeding off of then? Maybe what you're feeding off of is the fact that you don't care about that stuff. That's what makes you feel good. Whatever it is, it could be status. It could be success. It could be your family. It could be your education. It could be all the religious things you do. But we have a world that is full of people who are panting after the dust of the earth. You know what? Just a side light here. As we begin to talk about what satisfies the hunger in people's souls, we need, and this is not some you better evangelize, we need to begin to understand that the water of life, the bread of life who is Jesus, is the only thing that can satisfy souls. And so the people we come in contact with, we need to begin to see in our own spirits that the thing that satisfies is what people is Jesus, and that's what people need more than anything in the world. Friends, you need to hear, neighbor, there's a water that you can drink and you'll never thirst again. Jesus was on his way to Galilee in the book of John, and he met a woman at the well. This woman was an interesting character. She had a hunger in her and a thirst to be loved and a thirst to be accepted and cared for. And you know what? That was common to everyone. The way that she found to quench that thirst and satisfy that hunger was in inappropriate relationships. She had five men in her life at different times. She hadn't married them. She was living with them, and she went from one to the other to the other. Why would she go from one to the other to the other? Well, because they don't satisfy. And Jesus came to her and knew that of her, but he also knew something else of her. He knew of her what was true of everyone. There is a hunger in this woman's soul. There is a thirst in her soul. And what she's doing is that dirty rotten thing. And so he pointed his finger at her and said, you are really a sleazeball. It isn't what he said. That's what Pharisees say. That's what self-righteous Pharisees say who are feeding off of their righteousness and making that be the thing that quenches their thirst. They look to people who aren't as righteous externally as they are and say, you are sleazeballs. Jesus, seeing the fact that she was a hungry person, said this, you are a hungry person. The problem with you is that you're trying to get that satisfied in a place that can't do it. And I got water for you, friend. I got water. And if you drink this water, you'll never thirst again. That's good news. I am the bread of life. And she drank it. People chase dust. People chase dust. every one of us beloved have a hunger in our soul every one of us have a thirst to be loved to be accepted to feel valuable and every one of us are chasing something to get it not one person here doesn't fit into that category what are you feeding off of i just ask that the spirit of god would reveal that to you so you'd walk away from dust and come to life and i'm talking to christians too as Christians, we wander away and start eating dust again. Like the prodigal son, he goes back to the husks of the hogs and says, this is crazy. I got a feast waiting for me at home. What am I doing here? What are you feeding on? I got a brother that I'm pretty proud of. I got two brothers I'm pretty proud of. My brother Steve is a coach right now at the University of Minnesota, and he's going through some things that are very interesting for him. Now, they lost yesterday. a game they were supposed to win. In fact, he came up to me after the game and he said, I feel like we just lost to Bethel College. Which is not a good thing to do. But that's not what I wanted to talk about. What I wanted to talk about are some of the things that God has been revealing to him. And I'm real close to him, and it fits here. See, he's in an arena now that he's never been in before. It's safe to say that a jump from Bethel College to the University of Minnesota, whether you think university is that great or not right now, is a jump in terms of the kind of people you're rubbing shoulders with. And he got the job by just sticking his nose in there and all those kinds of things and he's dealing now with the cream of the crop, the best there is, the top of the profession. And one of the things he began to notice in his own spirit was that he was always feeling nervous and he was always feeling careful and he was always wondering if he was doing it right and he was stuffing a lot of feelings and he was striving like crazy. And it was because, without knowing it, just like you and me, every once in a while we start acting like we have to have it and that's the thing that feeds me. And being a coach here is what makes me okay. And if that's true, then you gotta have it and you better hang on to it and you better be the best there is. And he was laying in bed one day and his wife noticed what was going on with him and that he was walking on eggshells all the time and she said to him, "Dave or Steve, I'm Dave, he's Steve." And I wasn't with his wife. She said, "Dave or Steve." You're not even going to believe this when I'm done. Okay. She said, "Steve, you're acting like you have to have this job. All you need to know, Steve, is that this job is good and it's fun, but it's dust. It's dust. And Steve, we need to get our water from a different well. We need to get our food from a different source. And just like you and me, it happens sometimes, something snaps and you start seeing, "I'm getting my life from something that can't give it." And something snapped in him. You know what I know about him right now? He's going to be able to move and live and coach and do what he does, as if he has nothing to lose. You know why? Because he doesn't. Because he doesn't. You know why? Because even if he gets blown away, even if he ends up being the worst coach there is, you're drinking from a different well. You're drinking from water that don't run dry. You're taking bread from someplace else. And so I can do what I do with reckless abandon. The freest people I know are people who are drinking water from the well called Jesus, who are eating the bread of life that is called Jesus. And everything they do, they can do 100% because it doesn't matter if I fail. It's okay because I'm okay because of him. the point is this everybody's got a hunger in their soul the key is what you're looking to to satisfy the hunger hunger and thirst the blessed ones are the ones who hunger and thirst for righteousness that's going on to point three what is the kind of righteousness that kingdom people hunger for well what do you mean dave what kind of righteousness is there more than one kind of righteousness you better know that you better know that there is more than one kind of righteousness You see, there is one kind of righteousness that is called the righteousness of the Pharisees. And the righteousness of the Pharisees is not the righteousness that kingdom people hunger and thirst for. The righteousness of the Pharisees is this. It is just exactly that, the righteousness of the Pharisees. It's their righteousness. It is earned righteousness. It is acquired righteousness. It is self-righteousness. And what they fed off and what they used to drink to satisfy the thirst in them that was in them, because it's in everyone, was not Jesus and it wasn't God. It was godly things. It was how much they did. It was how much they knew. It was how many Bible verses they memorized. That was the plight of the scribe. And that's what they fed off. And it was how pious they acted. That was their meat. That was their drink. And Jesus says in Matthew 5, 20, that kind of righteousness is an inadequate righteousness, and that kind of righteousness is just as much dust as the woman at the well chasing after inappropriate relationships. Look at Matthew 5, verse 20. I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses or is a different kind of righteousness than the scribes who know the Bible and the Pharisees who are the fundamentals, If your righteousness is not more than theirs, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. You've got to have a different kind of righteousness. Theirs was earned and acquired and dealt in and issued in pride. What is the kind of righteousness the kingdom people thirst for? The kind of righteousness the kingdom people thirst for is his righteousness, not my righteousness. It's his righteousness, not my righteousness. 2 Corinthians 5.21 says, He made him who knew no sin to become sin, that we might become the what? The righteousness of God in Christ. The righteousness of God in Christ. It's his righteousness, not mine. And you know where the hunger for his righteousness comes from? It comes when I begin to realize that all of my righteousness isn't enough righteousness. All of my doing good isn't enough doing good. and I give up on my righteousness. I'm broken of all of that and I begin to look to the only place that I can be made okay and that is at the cross of Christ. And when I go to the cross, he does something for me that is absolutely incredible. He gives to me his righteousness and he declares me because of his blood and my looking to him as my source, he declares me righteous, holy, blameless, fit for heaven. Look up Romans chapter 3 with me. I want you to read some good news. Romans chapter 3, verse 21. The righteousness that kingdom people thirst for is not a righteousness brought on by keeping the law. It is not a righteousness of just doing good and trying hard. Apart from the law, the righteousness of God, verse 21, has been manifested. It's been made known. It was witnessed by the law and the prophets. Even the righteousness of God, how? Through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe, for there is no distinction. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. We are justified as a gift by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, not your trying hard. And Jesus, God publicly displayed him as a propitiation in his blood through faith. This was to demonstrate his righteousness, because in the forbearance of God he passed over the sins previously committed. for the demonstration, I say, of his righteousness at the present time that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Christ. Where then is boasting? I'll tell you where boasting is. Boasting is if you're self-righteous. Boasting is if your food and the meat you eat and the water you drink is your own performance. And then after you perform well, you can go, I feel better about me because I did well. boasting among people who are hungering and thirsting for his righteousness is excluded. Because it's not my performance that justifies me. It's not my performance that gets God to like me. It's my walking over here, broken of my performance, and says, God, my only hope is you. And that's the kind of righteousness that kingdom people hunger for. And when they hunger for that, you know what they get? satisfied. They get grace. They get forgiveness. They get peace. They get an awareness that I am rightly standing before God. And there's nothing I can do to make it worse and there's nothing I can do to make it better. What I can do is accept it. But that leads me to another question. And that is this. Where does that hunger come from? Where does the hunger for the right kind of righteousness come from? Where does the hunger that breaks me of my own striving to trust in Him alone come from? Number one, I think it comes from a proper understanding of the law of God. Please hear me, there's some teaching here you need to get. The reason I say the proper understanding is because I believe most people do not understand the proper function of the law of God. The Pharisees looked at the law of God and believed that the law was there for them to live up to. And so when they did live up to it or acted like they lived up to it, you know what happened? A wonderful thing happened. They felt what? Righteous. They felt justified. The fact is this. The purpose of the law of God is not to justify us. It is not to make us righteous. The purpose of the law is to break us and to convince us that trying to come to God by our own righteousness is never going to work. And that's why, by the way, in Matthew 5, 21, turn back to that. After Jesus said to the Pharisees, unless your righteousness surpasses the Pharisees, he then looked to the Pharisees and said, Pharisees, you heard it said by the ancients, you shall not commit murder, and whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court. But I say to you that everyone who is angry shall be guilty. You know what? Some people interpret that and go, so that means we're not even supposed to be angry, and so I'm going to just try harder to not be angry now. You don't understand the purpose of the law. You don't understand what Jesus was really trying to do there. He wasn't saying to the Pharisees, your righteousness, Pharisees, has to be even better. He was speaking to Pharisees who thought they were great and trying to give them a deeper law that they weren't keeping to convince them they never could. Do you understand that? You need to understand that because that's the gospel. If you don't understand that, I don't know if you understand grace. And I believe that if they would have said, yeah, I don't even think about that, he would have said, well, I've heard it said, And you've heard it said that you don't commit adultery. And you're not committing adultery. Well, I'm going to give you another one that just proves you can't come the law away. Here's this. Don't even think about a woman. Okay? Go ahead, try. Oh, you did that one too, huh? Well, I've got another one for you that's going to convince you that you can't go the law away. You've heard it said not steal. Well, I'm going to tell you don't covet. Don't even want it. That stupid response right there is what's supposed to happen when you get confronted with the law. You get exasperated, you get tired, you get broken, and when you get broken you go, my only hope is you. That's the gospel. And now you're ready for water that will quench and bread that will satisfy. I wonder if as I'm going through this you're beginning to see the progression in the Sermon on the Mouth. We've alluded to it last time. Remember that? I talked last time about gentleness and meekness as being a characteristic of those in the kingdom. But there was a progression. Meekness started with what? Brokenness. And the people I know who are before the Lord broken and getting out here what's in here because they're mourning. You know what they are? They're gentle. You want to know something else? The people I know who are broken of their own striving have come to the end of themselves. You know what they are? Right now they are hungry for a righteousness that is not theirs so that they can stand rightly before God not because of what they're doing, but because of what he has done. People who cry out to God, God, I've tried to live my life, all my life, the best I can. I've tried all my life to do it right, and I can't. And when you say those words that for years, maybe for you, have been the worst words you could ever utter, I can't. When you say those words, all heaven sings. All heaven sings. That lady's going to give up. That man's going to give up. And they're going to be ready now to come and drink from water so they'll never thirst again. The kingdom of God is filled with people who used to be religious and righteous and wealthy and positive thinking, who came to a point where they realized that their religious activity was worthless and empty and weak, who realized that their righteousness was filthy rags, who realized that their wealth was really poverty, who realized that their positive thinking was really thin, that it was all dust, and came to a point where they could say, my only hope is you. But I got one more thing to finish with. People who come in the kingdom come hungering and thirsting. If you didn't come that way, you didn't come. If you didn't come broken of all the other ways you're trying to get right and fill yourself and say, my only hope is you, that's how you come into the kingdom. Nobody ever came into the kingdom. You might have said some religious words and stuff, but if you did not see that he was your only source, then you don't understand kingdom life. But you need to know something. When you have been broken, and when you have let go of every other source that you're looking to to make you okay, and you've made Jesus your salvation, there's another hunger that when you become redeemed is planted in you. And this is where I really get excited. There's something else that is born in you, another kind of hunger. And that is this. suddenly when I become redeemed and I receive a righteousness that is not mine but it's his that righteousness comes to me but you know what? as soon as that righteousness comes to me I got a hunger planted in me by that very righteousness by that very presence of Christ and the hunger is that that righteousness that has come to me would now begin to flow through me I want it more than anything in the world and one of the ways that I can tell that you have been redeemed and that the kingdom has come to you and that his righteousness has come to you is that that righteousness that has come to you is now planting a desire in you for righteousness to flow through you. I want to be like Jesus more than anything in the world. And Paul said it this way, my ambition, chapter 3 of Philippians, is that I may know him. Think about that. My ambition, Philippians 3.10, that I may know him. What do you mean, Paul? Don't you know him? Don't you know him? If anybody knew Jesus, Paul knew him. It's not what he meant. He knew he was righteous. He knew he was rightly standing. He knew he was forgiven. But that righteousness that he received planted in him a hunger for more. I desire to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering. I want to know everything about him. I want to feel what he felt. I hid spirits in me and I want it to pump through my veins. I want to know what he felt. I want to understand the power of the kingdom and I want to see that flow through me. And I also am willing to submit myself to the same suffering that Jesus suffered because I want to feel what he felt. I want to be just like him. It's what Paul meant, I believe, in Ephesians 5, verse 1, when he was speaking to people that he had spent four chapters telling them who they were in Christ. You are the righteousness of God in Christ. You are redeemed people. You have been sealed by the Spirit forever. Therefore, knowing that the righteousness of God has come to you, I know that your deepest desire is that the righteousness of God flow through you. Therefore, be ye imitators of God. And you know what hungry people do? They go, that's what I want. I want to be just like my dad. I want to be just like the father who bore me more than anything in the world. And to hungry people, you don't beg them to eat. You go, there's the meat. Guys, that's what Sunday's about. I'm not here and never will beg you. Oh, please, get in the word. Come to church. I don't care about that. Here's the meat. Eat. Hungry people do. hungry people people who aren't hungry don't and I got no desire to try to make unhungry people hungry I have a desire to reveal to those kind of people that they're probably dead something weird about people who are alive you know what it is? they hunger and they thirst you ever see a hungry man eat? you ever see a thirsty person drink? it is in a pretty sight do you think Jeremiah had it when he said things like this thy words were found and I ate them we're talking about a hungry person and they were to me a duty they were to me the joy and rejoicing my heart because you are my life you are my life and while everybody around me is reviling me Jeremiah would say and everybody around me is telling me I have no value and I listen to a word I say my words were found and I eat them and they were to me my water and my bread there is no hunger for God for his righteousness again not your own I don't think there's life you know I really think and God put on my heart for this one our young people and young people I want you to hear me right now you're going through some real hard times there's changes in your identity and who you are and what you feel like and you're going through some real rebellious kinds of things that are real normal and you need to assert your autonomy and that's great and we'll hang on to you while you do we'll try to hang on to your parents too but you need to ask yourself as you go through all that stuff and you even fight with, you know, I got a heart for you young people. I grew up in the church. I grew up in the church. And I know what it feels like to be, to have Bible verses crammed down my throat that I didn't care about and go to meetings I didn't like and all that other kind of stuff. And I know what it feels like to try to break away from all that and find out what it is to me. And I know what I looked like when I was going through that and I didn't look real good. So I can be okay with you. But I know something about me when I was 18 years old. God broke me. and he caused me to see the poverty of my cool attitude and he caused me to see the poverty of all the things I was trying to eat to be okay and the first thing I noticed about me when he broke me was that for the first time in my life I had a hunger and it wasn't for religious stuff and it wasn't for more Sunday school classes and it wasn't for the stuff that had been crammed down my throat it was for God and you need to ask yourself young people older people too if you don't have a hunger for God if you don't have a thirst for him I'm not talking about religious stuff if you don't have a thirst for him I don't care who you are I don't care who your daddy and your mommy are I don't care how long you've been here you are probably not in the kingdom of God and you need to hear that hungry people know whether they are or not where are we at? where are you at this morning? we're going to go to a time of worship. And I believe that this time of worship that we're going to have, it's not going to be long. But it's not going to be short either. Don't take any solace in that. We're going to let God do some ministry here. But you know what I'm real aware of? And as people come, don't let that distract you because I still have some things I want to say as they come to get prepared. Some of you this morning are with us and you're eating dust. You're eating dust. And as I've been speaking, you've been identifying yourself and you are sick and tired of it because it's been revealed to you this morning by the Spirit that what you're eating to be okay. Maybe it's being the perfect mom. How's that? You know, that's dust. Maybe it's being the perfect employee. That's dust too. It's not bad to be a good mom. I think you understand what I'm saying. But you've been eating dust. And some of you have been eating religious dust and you've been trying so hard to do all the right things. And you've been having your devotions. And there's nothing wrong with devotions. But if that's what you're having for your meal, you don't eat the menu, folks. Jesus is the meal. you know what you need today? you need to take a drink when we come to worship let God break you let him break you of all the things you're eating that can't satisfy and let him satisfy I'm talking to believers who started eating dyes I'm talking to non-believers too who have been eating dust all your life and you're sick of it too and you've tried everything being the perfect mom and being the perfect, all those things. And you know, I'm not spending any time convincing you that it's dusk, as you know. As we sing, take a drink. Let him be your source. Ask him to come and invade your life with the kingdom of God. And make you a brand new creature that will create in you a new hunger and a new thirst. That the righteousness of God that has come to you will flow through you. And he'll do it to you on the spot. There are some of you who are eating dust and you like it. And you're saying, Dave, this is great. All these people are buying this. I like what I'm doing. Good. Keep it up. Get a belly full. No power at all to convince you that what you're eating is dust. When you discover that it is, then we'll talk. We're going to have a time of worship. And I want to pray before we do. God, I pray that you would do your work among us. We set your spirit free to minister. Father, there are some here who are drinking from you and I just pray that this time would be a time for them to just enjoy. God set us free to do here what we need to do. Some will need to come forward and just pray. Some will need to just want to just stay where they are and pray. Some will just sing. God, we ask that your spirit flow here. That the water of Jesus would be made available to us and that we would drink it in and that we would eat the bread of life. Bless our worship. control this time in Jesus' name.
