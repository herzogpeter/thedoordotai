We are entering today our third and final week of study in the book of Esther. There's a mini-series that we have entitled, Esther, More Than Just a Pretty Face. The defining moment in Esther's life, confirming the fact that she was indeed more than just a pretty face, we came upon two weeks ago in chapter 4, verse 16, when she spoke these amazing words. And so I will go into the presence of the king, which is not according to the law, and if I perish, I perish. Prompting us to ask this question, around which we are structuring our entire study. How does heroic, defiant faith, like we are seeing modeled here in Esther's life, get formed in the lives of ordinary people like you and me? What kinds of things does God use to create and to develop that kind of extraordinary faith? Well, last time in the flow of the story, we identified two things. First, we found out that God uses the strong challenge of a devoted but tough-loving friend, and we saw that in the life of Mordecai. The second thing we discovered is that God uses crisis to, in ways that, quite frankly, nothing else can force us to decide who we are, what we want, what we believe, and who we serve. Today, we are going to discover two more things that God uses to develop defined heroic faith, the kind we see in Esther. But first, let's just kind of catch up with the story. We first met Esther in chapter 2, where she took the place of Queen Vashti by virtue of what amounted to the winning of a beauty contest. Chapter 2, verse 3 said this, And let the king appoint overseers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather every beautiful young virgin to Susa, the capital. And let the young lady who pleases the king be queen in place of Vashti. And the matter pleased the king, and he did accordingly. And you know how it is that Esther won that beauty contest, but she would soon prove herself to be far more than just a beauty queen. she was indeed a faithful servant of and mighty warrior for the living God. It was also in chapter 2 that we met another key player, Mordecai, Esther's cousin, who raised Esther as his own daughter when she was orphaned as a young child. Now, Mordecai was drawn into the story by two events. The first was this in chapter 221, as he sat at the king's gate and overheard and then exposed the plot to kill King Ahasuerus. that exposure of the plot saved the king's life it was recorded in the king's annals or the king's chronicles but Mordecai for that act was never rewarded that's going to become significant and tie back in as the story unfolds a bit more today the second thing that drew Mordecai into the story was interestingly Haman the right hand man of the king who despised Mordecai now the reason he hated him so was multifaceted. Number one, Haman, we have discovered, hated all Jews in general. And when this Jew in particular, Mordecai, irritated him by not bowing down to him, all of the generalized hatred that Haman had for all Jews kind of got transferred specifically into or onto Mordecai in particular. Chapter 3, verse 5, When Haman saw that Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage to him, Haman was filled with rage. Born of this seething rage, Haman conceived a plot. Not only to eliminate Mordecai, but he saw it as an opportunity to also eliminate his kind, all of the Jews. When he gave this plot to the king, the king naively, blindly, I think, not understanding fully what he was agreeing to, agreed. And so it was decreed in chapter 3, verse 13, that on the 13th day of the 12th month, all the Jews would be destroyed, literally annihilated, both young and old, women and children, but it would begin with Mordecai. Note, throughout all of these goings-on, neither Haman nor the king knew of Mordecai's connection to the queen Esther. When Mordecai got wind of this plot, he sent word to Esther, making it very clear what he thought she should do. Chapter 4, verse 8. Esther, here's the deal. No ifs, ands, or buts. You go into the presence of the king, and you leverage the position that you have been placed in. You use your authority to implore his favor and plead with him on behalf of your people. Esther's first response to that directive was to resist and reject it, and for good reason. We found out a couple weeks ago in chapter 4, verse 11. Esther makes it very clear to Mordecai, you don't have the whole story. What you need to understand is that to come into the presence of the king unsummoned is a capital offense. That means that if he does not extend his scepter to you and you were not invited, you get the death penalty. On top of that, Esther herself had not been summoned for 30 days. The point of that is this, that Esther had good reason to wonder where she stood and how he would respond, that is the king. So she had good reason to fear. the risk of going into his presence at all, let alone asking him to do something about a policy he had put into place, was real. The risk was real. At that point, when Esther said no, Mordecai did something that many of us would hesitate to do, not wanting to manipulate or push anybody too much. He pushed her. And he pushed her hard. Essentially saying this, Esther, you cannot afford to be naive about this, for the consequences of what you are about either to do or not do is going to ripple out, have incredible effect on many people, but I promise you this as well. It's going to boomerang back on you, and as much as you would like to stay uninvolved, you cannot stay out of this any longer. Chapter 4, verse 13, he said it this way, Esther, do not imagine that you, because you're in the king's palace, will escape any more than all the Jews. For if you remain silent at a time like this, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place. I promise you, God is going to take care of his people. His kingdom is going to go on. His purposes will be fulfilled. But you will pay a consequence for your lack of response. Indeed, your disobedience. Your father's house will perish, and so will you. And then he gives her a challenge. I want you to dream with me. I want you to consider the possibility. Who knows, he says, whether you have not attained this royalty, won this beauty contest for such a time as this. He pushed her hard. Esther's response to that strong challenge is why we have a story to tell. As I said at the beginning, it is the defining moment of Esther's life when she said in chapter 4, verse 16, Therefore I will go into the presence of the king, which is not according to the law. Indeed, it is unlawful. And if I perish, I perish. The first thing we saw that God uses to develop defiant, courageous, heroic faith was the strong challenge of a devoted, tough, loving friend. The second was crisis. The third today was obedience. The act of obedience to develop defiant faith. For when we risk obedience, regardless of the consequences, and that's exactly what she did. If I perish, I perish. And if I lose my job, I lose my job. And if I lose this friendship, I lose this friendship. I will hate that, but I am going to obey regardless of the cost. Obedience like that requires growth. You had to grow a certain amount to get to that place. But I'm telling you, when you obey like that, the obedience itself causes you to grow, deepens you on the spot. Some of you may remember back in the book of Philippians, we were dealing with this very issue that we need to act on the things that God prompts us to do. And we kind of came up with an expression or a way of saying it. And it was this. When we put our hand to what our heart prompts, in the putting of our hand to what our heart prompts, something is ignited. And that it's not enough to just get a big warm and gooey feeling. I think I want to. It'd be really nice. And even make a declaration of something. It's when we do what we say we want to do, that something is ignited. and growth is accelerated. In chapter 4, verse 16, she said it. If I perish, I perish. That's very stirring. It preaches very well. In chapter 5, verse 1, she did what she said she was going to do. Verse 1, chapter 5, it came about on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace in the front of the king's rooms and the king was sitting on his royal throne in the throne room opposite the entrance of the palace. He hasn't said a word. Neither has she. She's just walked into his presence. Her knees are shaking. Her heart is pounding. Am I going to live or die? Freeze frame it there. You just need to understand that at this point of obedience, when she doesn't know if she's going to live or die, she has acted on what she determined to do. Her primary goal is no longer her survival. It is no longer her career as the queen. it is no longer her status agenda even her very existence in a very real way when Esther chose to obey God she chose to die Dietrich Bonhoeffer said it this way when Jesus calls a man he bids him come to die and that is a dimension of discipleship that some of us never even entertain let alone respond positively to. When God calls us to risky obedience, however, where something is at stake, you feel like you're going to die. See, the worst case scenario for Esther, however, was no longer death. The worst case scenario for her now was to live as if she were dead. It was no longer death, the worst case scenario. Now the worst case scenario was to lose her integrity, to never take the chance, to never stand our ground, to never decide or discover, who am I really? What do I believe really? What do I love really? Who do I serve? What am I willing to die for? And you know what? When you discover what you're willing to die for, you will in that discover what you're willing to live for. Esther, by risking obedience here in this story, is modeling for us a faith-filled kingdom response to words of Jesus she would never hear, but she simply lived them out. The words were these, What shall it profit a man or a woman if they would gain the whole world but lose their own soul? Esther, in her obedience, was risking her whole world. About to lose it all, maybe even die. But the glorious kingdom truth that rings down the corridors of history unchanged is this, in that place of death, She found her life. And it all began with a decision to obey regardless of the cost. And if I perish, I perish. Here's the principle. God strengthens us. God transforms us. God builds into us deep, defiant, heroic faith at the very time that we risk it all to obey. The fourth thing that God uses to develop in us this kind of defiant faith we see in Esther is revealed in the rest of the story. So let's get back to the story. Chapter 5, verse 2, we'll pick it up. Esther has come into the presence of the king. We don't know what's going to happen. Verse 2, and it happened. When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight. And the king extended to Esther the golden scepter which was in his hand. She's going to live. So Esther came near and touched the top of the scepter. Then the king said to her, what is troubling you, Queen Esther, and what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it will be given to you. You need to understand something. When the king says even to half the kingdom will be given to you, he does not mean that. If Esther were to say, oh, well, cool, I'll take half of the kingdom. She'd be out on her ear, I promise you. This is king talk for I'm in a good mood. You can pick lunch. That's about it here. She knows that she cannot just blurt out, well, here's what I'd like you to do. I'd like you to revoke the inalterable law of the Medes and Persians against my people, the Jews, and I'd like you to get rid of your right-hand man. Esther is very wise and very skillful, even in the ways of the king, and she is indeed going to use the system itself. She's not in a position of authority to change the system. She's going to use the system, wise and skillful. see, see, so what she does, she invites the king and Haman, his right-hand man, to a banquet the next day that she is going to give for them, just the two of them. And then, she says, I will tell you what my request is, chapter 5, verse 8. In verse 9, the story, if this was a movie, we would, you know, Ahasuerus and Esther out of the picture, and we follow Haman home. And after this invitation to come to Esther's banquet just for the king and Haman, Haman is flying high. Not only am I close to the king, but now the queen evidently has special regard for me. I get invited to everything. I really have arrived. I'm in the inner circle. But it's interesting, even with all these wonderful things happening in his life, at least as he can discern them, he's still not a happy camper. Let's look at this. Verse 9. Then Haman went out that day glad and pleased of heart. Why? Because he got invited to this invitation only, VIP party. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate again, and that he did not stand up or tremble before him again, Haman was filled with anger against him again. Haman controlled himself, however, being full of dignity, went to his house and sent for his friends and his wife, Zeresh. Then Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the number of his sons, every instance where the king had magnified him and how he had promoted him above the princes and servants of the king. Haman also said, even Esther the queen, let no one but me come with the king to the banquet which she has prepared. And tomorrow also I am invited by her with the king. Yet all of this does not satisfy me every time I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate. Get the picture here. He calls his wife and a few of his friends together, basically to kind of take inventory on his life, the assets of his life, the liabilities. On the plus side, he lists glory, riches, power, position, and posterity. This is a man who is on ascent. On the negative side, one thing. Just one guy who ruins it all. It's a lot of power to give one person. None of this satisfies me, says Haman, which, by the way, is the miserable nature of life. For men and women outside the reign of God, where nothing is ever enough. Contrasts quickly a snapshot. It's powerful between Esther and Haman. Esther, in coming to the presence of the king, risking obedience no matter what the costs, Dies to herself in that. And in her dying to herself lives. Haman, who lives for himself, is very soon going to die. Esther, who lets it all go, who puts it all down, is going to get it all back. Haman, who's constantly grabbing it for himself, is going to lose everything he's grasping for. Chapter 5, verse 14. Then Zeresh, his wife, and all his friends said to Haman, have a gallows 50 cubits high made, and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go joyfully to the king in the banquet. You couldn't possibly have fun at that banquet if you know this guy's still alive. So have him killed, then have a good time at the party. Just kind of deal with that little detail. The advice, please, Haman. So he had the gallows made overnight. It gets very interesting as this drama begins to pick up speed. In chapter 6, verse 1, while Haman is off building these gallows to kill Mordecai, for some reason during the night, the king could not sleep. So he gave an order to bring the book of records, the chronicles, and they were read before the king. He's the king, so he doesn't read for himself. He just gets somebody else to read for him. What would you like us to read? Well, I'd like you to read the chronicles. And the chronicles, as I've already told you, are the annals of the king, and all they do is talk about the king. They're the story about the king. So what would you like us to read? oh, I don't know that book about me would be nice. I like that one. So they start reading the book about him, and it was found in this book, the Annals of the King, written what Mordecai had reported concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, that they had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. And the king said, what honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this? And the king's servants who attended him said, well, nothing's been done for him. So the king said, well, who's in the court right now? Well, Haman had just entered the outer court of the king's palace in order to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows which he had prepared for him. This is great. And the king's servants said to him, well, Haman is standing in the court. And the king said, well, call him in then as long as he's here. So Haman came in and the king said to him, Haman, what is to be done for the man whom the king desires to honor? And Haman said to himself, He didn't actually, that's kind of in there somewhere. Whom would the king desire to honor more than me? He's obviously talking about me. I'm going to make this really good. Then Haman said to the king, For the man whom the king desires honor, let them bring a royal robe which the king has worn, and a horse on which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown has been placed. And let the robe and the horse be handed over to one of the king's most noble princes, and let them array the man whom the king desires to honor and lead him on horseback through the city square and proclaim before him, Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king desires to honor. Haman's feeling really good. Then the king said to Haman, Good idea. Take quickly the robes and the horse, just as you have said, and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the king's gate. Do not fall short in any of all that you have come up with. Wouldn't you love to see his face? So Haman did it. He took, verse 11, the robe and the horse and arrayed Mordecai, led him on horseback through the city square and proclaimed. Here's Haman saying this. Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king desires to honor all the way through the deal. And as he does it, he is filled with seething rage. He is humiliated. Add one more thing, he is very, very afraid. He knows something's going on now. It's all done. Mordecai's honor is over. Haman runs home to tell his wife, and in verse 14, it says that while they were still talking, the king's eunuchs arrived and brought Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared. After that, the end comes quickly. Chapter 2, verse 7, Ahasuerus asks Esther, what is your request? Verse 3, she tells the story of how she and her people would be destroyed. And she probably discloses there for the first time that she is a Jew. And then she even says, interestingly, you know, if all it was was about our slavery, I wouldn't even bother you with this. This isn't even about getting set free. All we want is to be allowed to live. King Ahasuerus, I want no special treatment. We would just like life. the king is angered and in verse 6 in verse 5 asks who is it that has conceived this plan verse 6 and Esther said a foe and an enemy is this wicked Haman then Haman became terrified before the king and queen turns out that Haman had good reason to be terrified for in verse 10 Haman is hanged on the very gallows that he built prepared for Mordecai. Now in verse 8, it gets even better for Esther. King Ahasuerus, beginning now to respect and discern in Esther's character and ability even to lead, says to Esther, here, I'm going to give to you Haman's estate. You do with it as you will. And she arranges for Haman's estate to go to Mordecai. That's kind of cool. Then the king needs a new right-hand man. Interestingly, his respect for Esther is so great that he confers with Esther about who should be the new right-hand man, and she arranges for Mordecai to become the replacement of Haman, the king's new right-hand man. See that in verse 2. After all of that, she then goes back to the king on her own initiative and reminds him of the edict that has not been revoked to slaughter the Jews. And in verse 8, King Ahasuerus gives to Esther independent authority to, quote, do as you see fit. And that pretty much tells the whole story. Let me now pull this whole wonderful thing together as I draw to a close with a series of questions that will pull us into the fourth thing that helps develop defiant faith and will also pull us into the entire point of this story. The questions are these. Think with me. How is it that of all the women in the empire, many of whom were beautiful and compelling, How is it that this obscure young girl named Esther would find favor in the sight of the king and become the queen? How'd that happen? And how is it that of all the people who stood at the king's gate, a Jew named Mordecai, who happened to be the cousin, who lived like the father of Esther, is the one who, of all the people who could hear it, he's the one who hears about the plot to kill the king and saves his life. And how is it that the king should have insomnia on the very night that Haman is building the gallows to kill Mordecai? That of all the books that the king could have chosen to be read on the night he couldn't sleep, the one he chose was the Chronicles of the King. And that of all the things the reader who was opening the Chronicles of the King could have turned to, what he turned to and read was the account of Mordecai saving the king's life. How is it that Haman the schemer becomes the victim of his own scheme? that Mordecai, the intended victim, becomes his replacement. How did the king's ring given to Haman end up on Mordecai's hand? And how did the noose intended for Mordecai end up around Haman's neck? Was it luck? Was it chance? Was it fate? Maybe it was lots. You might remember two weeks ago, we made a big thing about the lots that Haman cast for every day of the year to try to determine which day would be the most beneficial, the luckiest, how faith would shine on us in the casting of the lots so we could pick the perfect day to execute all the Jews. Turns out his lucky day, and he cast lots to do that. Turns out his lucky day was the day Jews weren't executed. He was executed. I also told you last time that at the end of Esther, Esther instituted a feast that God's people, The Jews continue to celebrate every year. It's called the Feast of Purim. The word Purim means lots. It is the Feast of the Lots, and it's an ironic twist on Haman's casting of the lots that basically said we're going to trust in fate, we're going to trust in luck in the casting of the lots, and God's people through all eternity know that the Feast of Purim is a mockery of the casting of the lots because while he was trusting in fate, God was in control every step of the way. indeed the writer of the book of Esther wants us to know that the entire purpose and point of this story is this that even when God's people are in exile when you and I are in places of our life where we are away from home and don't know how to get back that even when God seems invisible silent and absent he is not the point of this story is this that God is present and active in unseen, unknown, sometimes indiscernible ways that even when we can't see it, feel it, or hear it, His purposes are certain, His ways are right, His mercies are everlasting, His gifts and His promises are irrevocable. And knowing that, believing that, living convinced of that is the fourth thing that helps develop heroic, defiant faith. to be believing even when I can't see it, even when I don't feel it, that God is alive, that God is at work, that God is for me, that God is in control. That kind of belief posture is what results in people like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego facing a fiery furnace saying this. You know what, Nebuchadnezzar? Our God can deliver us. And then they get full of faith. Our God will deliver us. And then they get full of reality. But even if he doesn't, and we burn up and die, here's what we believe. Our God is in control, and we're not bowing down to you. I don't care how the circumstances go. We could die here. We believe God's in control. We're going to obey him. Believing in a God who's in control is also what results in people like Esther, who facing the loss of it all, including the possibility of our own life, say things like this, I will go into the presence of the king, which is not according to the law, and if I perish, I perish. Most of you know that on December 19th this past year, literally just a few weeks ago, seven weeks ago, a dear friend of our church, a faithful servant of, and courageous warrior of the living God died. His name was David Busby. At his funeral, he did a most amazing thing. He spoke, which is a pretty cool thing to do at your own funeral. By way, obviously, a video, which, by the way, also raised the bar substantially for all of us who want to go out with some kind of style. I'd kind of like to speak in my own I'm hoping that by the time I die they'll be able to do holograms I'll actually be able to appear Hello That'd be cool, it'll just freak you guys right out That'd be so cool My wife was going down there, that'd be great Anyway The clip that was showed at his funeral Was a 10 minute clip From a sermon he had given in San Antonio, Texas Just weeks before he went into the hospital for the last time. In fact, it was the last time, it was the last meeting, group of meetings he ever did. In this video, he speaks more eloquently than I ever could about a confidence in a God who is in control regardless of the circumstances. And I remember when I first saw it at the funeral, it was as if God, Dave, not even knowing, I don't think, what he was really fully saying when he said it was kind of speaking while he was still alive to us and kind of helping us deal with his going. What I wanted to do is I thought of this fourth point, that defiant faith is cultivated in the hearts of people who believe in a God who's in control. I just couldn't think of a better way to close not only this sermon but this series on defiant faith, dealing with heroic faith, than by hearing from someone who, in my mind, modeled it so wonderfully. with all of his frailty and all of his humanity. He was a man who lived heroic, defiant faith. Now, I need to warn you, this video is vintage Busby. It's full of laughter. It is full of passion. And it is full of riveting, compelling truth. And I believe it will minister to you life. let me tell you where sovereignty touched my bones as a young youth pastor I was a young youth pastor I don't remember the year late 70's maybe and I was still struggling with my self image and I knew in my mind I'm special I'm loved by God God's made my body for a reason blah blah blah blah it's December and I'm looking for a youth revival speaker in January some of you are already laughing because you've already heard it but hang on so this guy recommends this man by the name of Wayne to come and be our youth speaker well I didn't investigate I was about as naive as you can I've been in the youth ministry about 15 minutes so you know hey so I called this guy up see if he had a spot in his schedule the guy said yeah so I met him at the airport I'm waiting at the end of the jetway little did I know, little did I suspect that this guy would be the most handsome man who's ever walked planet earth I mean he would intimidate Brad Pitt so I'm sitting kind of at the end of the jetway waiting for my speaker and he comes out of the jetway and I just hear music in the back you know and immediately I go into rehearsing I'm loved for free God loves me just the way I am you know hello well I bring him to the church and the kids just you know like kids are because they're really into outward appearance okay okay well during the week it just kind of gets worse and worse and I'm kind of more and more moving over in the corner of the pew but he comes to the climax when a Wednesday afternoon the meeting's over Wednesday night but a Wednesday afternoon And Wayne comes over to me and said, David, I like to try to work out while I'm here on my preaching assignments. I just wonder if we might go to the gym and work out a little bit. And I'm thinking, how can I lie to this man? I have got to make up a story very, very quickly to save my life. Can I tell him the truth? Kinda. And the best I could come up with, I said, Well, Wayne, I would really like to go with you. Lie. But I didn't bring any workout gear. True. True. And then he gives me the unexpected thing. He says, That's all right. I always carry an extra prayer gear with me in my workout bag. Well, I hadn't been inside of one of those workout spas forever. I mean, I was honked. What was I going to say? I was really lying. I do not want to go with you. Well, I didn't have that much integrity. So I get in the car with him. We go. We get into the back of this work couch in the dressing room. We strip down our underwear. He opens up the magic bag. And he hands me a tank top. And I put it on. I'm telling you the truth. It comes down to right here. It looked like a nightie. I could put the thumbs in the armpit holes. Then he reaches and hands me a pair of shorts. okay come together the shorts on those shorts the legs were that big around have you ever looked at a bell and you seen that little clapper That's what my legs look like. Now, by the time I roll up my nightie, and I stick it in my shorts, I look like I need a serious operation. He hands me a pair of tube socks. One size fits all. Liar! I put that thing on and on and on I'm not making this up I mean it looked like a pair of support hose He handed me a pair of shoes At least that's what he called them I call them canoes I failed to mention this was January where he's from Florida, so he was all buffed and tanned and, you know, savage look, and I look like the Pillsbury Doughboy. Well, this is where this story gets serious. I was humiliated. I was just humiliated. And he walks on out in the workout thing. I just say, you go ahead. I'll be out there later. And, of course, all the guys just come around because he was real buffed, and people thought he was there for a contest, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. so I finally just muster up enough courage whatever's in there and I walk out I'm just so humiliated I can't hardly breathe with myself I mean when I was a kid growing up do you know I would bruise my legs because I would hit my fist on my legs didn't do that often but I just hated my polio legs so bad and some of you that struggle with self image welcome to planet earth hello Well, this is where this story gets serious. I end up sliding over, sitting on my tail behind a piece of universal equipment. And if I've ever had a real honest conversation with God, and I've had a lot of them, but I had a bone-to-bone conversation with God. I just kind of pulled up my chair to God's table and said, God, can we talk for a few minutes? And all the clichés and all the theological gobbledygook was gone, and I basically said to God, God, why did you make me like me? why'd you make me like this? Why don't you make me like him? Because you know what God this is what I believe I believe if you'd made me like him I believe I would still have loved you and if kids gathered around me like they gathered around him I think I'd have gathered them around Jesus I think I would I'm not even trying to tell you what to do God but I'm just honestly wanting to chat over coffee why didn't you make me like Wayne? And I tell you God God met me behind that piece of weight equipment And he said I got a couple things He said you're pulling up your chair to my table I'm pulling up my chair to your table You ask me a question I'm going to answer your question son Now you listen And what I'm getting ready to tell you You're righted in stone He was gentle But he was strong He said I got two things I want to say to you Number one I want the thing about you that people are drawn to is your heart and not your body. Write it on a rock. And number two, I'm going to send you all over the place and I'm going to demonstrate in you that I'm strong right in the middle of your weakness. Well, I remember I laughed like Sarah in the tent when God told her she was going to get pregnant because I was a little youth pastor out in the middle of the sticks and when God said, I think I don't remember I was trying to read my journal I think he said I'm going to send you all over the world and that's what caused me to laugh I'm not sure he said world but I know it was big and I laughed because I was a little youth pastor out in the middle of nowhere it was still an important significant work but it wasn't glamorous like this is and that's not a put down of Alamo City I'm talking about traveling is glamorous hello and I'm sitting here like Joseph must have sat here and I'm saying to you God told the truth and he has and he's fulfilled his word and he didn't make a mistake when polio knocked on my door in 1951 he did not He did not make a mistake when the sperm and the egg united, and part of that united was cystic fibrosis. He didn't make a mistake. And when I cough up blood at night after preaching like this, he didn't make a mistake. He didn't make a mistake. When I get to get wheeled in and out with wheelchairs, he didn't make a mistake. And do you know what, folks? If I die and I don't want to die like this, it'd be fine with me if God healed me. It'd be fine with me, it'd be fine with me, but I've been healed of the need to be healed. But I'll tell you this, if I'm breathing air in a ventilator, sucking air through a straw, and I die one of the most painful deaths anybody's ever seen, it will not change the goodness or the greatness of God one single molecule. God is in the heavens, and he does whatever he pleases, And what he does is right. His ways are right. His judgments are right. They might be uncomfortable like crazy for us, but he knows what he's doing. God is in control. I would like you to warmly welcome David's wife, Mrs. Luana Busby. Thank you so much. That makes it hard, you know. But thank you for that affirmation of my role in David's life. Over the course of the years that David and I spent together, a somewhat authentic question would often flit across my mind, especially when I was in the trenches of life, the very fiery furnace that Dave talked about of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, when life was tough, when it was long, when it was hard, when loneliness and fatigue became almost insurmountable, when obedience was not only risky but indeed life-threatening. Do I dare give my husband's very life away to people whom I've never met and perhaps will never, ever know? And even though I saw my role in David's life as an extension of my commitment to God and felt it was his assignment for me, I often ask the question, is there a me without a David? His fire was so hot, it ignited others. It even ignited me. And his passion was so intense that it was contagious. When he died seven weeks ago, my question became, was the fire his or mine? Is the very fire of God that was in David in me? Last Thursday was an errand day for me I had a whole list And it would keep me driving and in the car all day So as I was driving I began to contemplate my current life And words like scary, unpredictable, uncertain, daunting Permanently altered came to mind And then another thought came to mind I've come to the conclusion that I'm no longer responsible for anyone my life as a caregiver is over our only child, Deva, our daughter was married in July my husband died in December so here's the bottom line I can do anything I want I can go anywhere I want my lifestyle is of my own choosing now so what did I want? and as I withdrew into what Henry Nouwen would call the inner desert and focused deeply and closely at my own heart, I came face to face with the same flame that David had. It was the same consuming desire to passionately and completely follow the God he loved, not because he did, but because I do. And the inner fire that was so hot in him welled up in me so that I can authentically and truthfully say today before you, along with Dave, His ways are indeed right. He is in control, and whatever he does is right. He makes no mistakes. I stand before you today as living proof, just as my husband was before you a few minutes ago with dying proof, of the goodness and grace of a God who delights in being a flame. Whether it's in the flame of a burning bush, just like Moses, or in an imitable and passion-filled life. My future certainly faces deeper mourning and a host of intimidating, seemingly insurmountable questions and decisions. There is no script for my tomorrows. I have lost David, but I have not lost God. One was a gift for 26 years, the other a gift for eternity. God in his graciousness has given me David for those years. And in his wisdom he has taken him, and now his same grace will heal the hundred hurts of my heart. The same God who took great delight in Dave takes great delight in me. And when I put the sovereignty of God side by side with his unfailing love, my heart can rest, whether his ways are different than I can imagine or not. Philip Yancey once wrote, as often as not, characters of the Bible are shown contending with God, and that's okay. They prefer to go away limping like Jacob rather than to shut God out. And whether I limp or whether I perish, I prefer to hold fast to the lover of my soul, and if I perish, I perish. Thank you. and thus we close our study in the book of Esther dealing with the development of heroic faith having discovered that maybe among other things at least four things that come together to work in us this kind of faith is number one the challenge of a devoted or tough loving friend sometimes it's crisis sometimes it's the act of radical obedience regardless of the cost. And sometimes it's belief in God who is at work and in control even when we can't see it and don't feel it. I want you to know that as we're dismissed this morning, we wanted to make available to you this video and this video is going to be available in Fellowship Center in a number of places and also the entire series that Dave did, that last series that he ever did is also available today in the fellowship center and a few other areas of the building. And we just want you to know that's available this morning. Would you stand as we are dismissed? Let's pray. Father, we thank you for this amazing life that we have been studying for three weeks. Esther, who rose to a position of significance in the context of an insignificant thing, this beauty contest that many of us would scorn. And yet we found that she had something inside of her that was far deeper than skin deep beauty. Profound character and fierce faith. We thank you for models of living faith. Heroic faith. In that light, we are grateful for David and the model of heroic faith and all of his humanity and his reality is his frailty. He loved you fiercely. And for Luana, we ask blessing and courage and strength in her and on her and all the men and women in this place. We're told in your word that we're to gather together. The book of Hebrews says, don't neglect your coming together in order to stimulate one another to love and good deeds and deeper faith, I would add. So, Father, as we consider these men and women of faith, we consider them significantly. as people who can stimulate us to deeper life and deeper love and heroic faith. Your call to us is clear, and we pray your power to live these things out in Jesus' name. Amen.
