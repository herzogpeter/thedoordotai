Hey everyone, welcome to Open Door. We have this dream around here that the kids among us, the teenagers among us, the students among us, would say, and yes, there's action, there's energy, there's life, would say to God, take my life and let it be all for you and for your glory. I mean, that's a dream that we have around here, that the coming generations would declare that and that that would be true about their life. And every single one of these kids that were up here, and of the 500 who are going to be down there this morning, every single one of them is walking around as if they have a sign hanging from their neck. And the sign asks a question everywhere they go. And the question is, who am I? Who am I? And they get a lot of answers, right? As they watch TV and movies and as they go to school and get older, their friends are telling them who they are. Influences, good and bad, are telling them who they are. Well, we believe that one of the ways that our kids are going to be able to say, take my life, Lord, and let it be all for you and for your glory, is if the people in their community, in their church community, just so fill their ears with who they really are. That you are loved by God. that you are loved for free, that there is nothing that can separate you from God's love, that you are created by God for a purpose in this world, that you can partner with God in making all things new. That's who you are. And we have this crazy dream that they would hear that about 50 times a Sunday and that they would hear that on Wednesday and they would hear that from their mentors, that they would hear that from their leaders. This is who you are. And it's going to take that many messages to counteract the messages I think they get from our culture. So could we be a church that partners together in giving our kids that message? Amen? Could we do that? So this weekend, we invited the kids team to come and teach us what it's like to really engage with God and worship God. And so this service is going to be designed very much like a service downstairs is for our kids. So all the same elements that they do downstairs, we're going to do this up here today. And so I want to invite you to lean into the different, right? It's going to feel a little different. Like, well, that's not how we normally do it around here. Good. That's good. And then we're going to invite you to be a part of it. and just unapologetically because we care about kids and students around here almost like nothing else because they're they're the generations that will follow and there's an inheritance to give away so we're going to invite you to be a part of it good morning i am katie beasley the upper elementary associate here at church and uh i got i take care of the fifth and sixth graders which i know there are some in the balcony. You can give me a shout out. They're great kids, I promise. I have the extreme pleasure of walking you through the first open door origami experience. I know. Okay, take your paper, and if you didn't get a paper when you came in, this is your one chance, permission to dig in your neighbor's purse. And if you can find something to fold in there, preferably that's green, you can have whatever you find. Okay. So take your paper. We're going lengthwise. And we fold. It's like angel wings. The flutter of folding paper. Okay. And then we are going to do one more fold. But this is just a line that we are going to use. So we open it back up. Have I lost anybody? Okay. Take this corner, and you are going to butt it up against that line. And take the other corner and butt it up against that line. And pinch it down. And this is what you should have so far. Correct? Yes? Can I see it? Very nice. Very, very nice. Okay. We could stop here. And it could be a bomber, a stealth bomber, or a beard. But we're not going to stop. So turn down again and flip the top part over, just the one side. Give it a nice little crease there. Flip it over. One more nice little crease. beautiful okay and then give it a open it up put it on your head and you just made yourself a hat thank you very much okay but we're not done if you feel like you want to follow me do it, but I'm going to go fast. So this may push on some of your intelligence. But here we go. Open it up to the square and corner to the top and pinch. Turn it around and corner to the top and pinch. Okay, now we're going to open it up and pinch. okay and corner to the top and we're pinching everybody's still pinching okay corner to the top and it's a football or is it a boat huh but you might think that we're going to stop there but I have one more trick and this is basically for no apparent reason but I'm going to show you what I could do behind my back with a boat you're never going to believe what I'm going to make a t-shirt and that is it Thank you for participating in the origami experience. Ah, Father. It is a good day to be alive. And your son thanks you for this beautiful day. Yes, it is a good day. And a good day for fishing. As I see my disciples in their ship just off the shore fishing. Not having much luck. I will make you fishers of men, fishers of men, fishers of men, if you come and follow me. I kind of like that. I think that's going to be a hit. Now, I need something else. Hey, guys, got any fish? No. No. Nothing. Only thing biting this early are the mosquitoes. Well, try... Try throwing your lines off the other side of the boat. The right side. Then you'll get some. Right side of the boat? What, are we throwing it on the wrong side? Yeah, yeah. What does this guy think he is? Like, Babe Winkleman or somebody? Whoa, whoa, guys. Fish on. Fish on. Whoa. Oh, Jesus. Lord, I knew it was you the whole time Or, well I figured it out Eventually Simon Come, have breakfast with me Whoa, this net weighs a ton Wow, that is the biggest suckerfish I've ever seen Jesus Lord, it's so good to see you again Good morning Wow, we caught like 153 fish I forgot my watch at home again. Friends, come. Let's eat. James, how do you like your eggs? John, more bacon? Just kidding. Guys, lighten up. It's early. So, did you know it was me calling from the shore this morning? Yes. Yes. Of course. No. No, not really. No. No. Well, we just kind of thought it was a wise guy talking. Okay, you are a wise guy. Oh. I love you guys. Simon, do you love me? Jesus, not in front of the guys. Walk with me. Simon, son of John. Do you truly love me more than these? Well, yes, Lord. You know that I love you. Feed my lambs. Okay. Hello, Purina. I'm going to need 50 bags of lamb chow. Oh, Simon. Simon. What? Simon, son of John. Do you truly love me? Well, yes. You know that I love you. Then take care of my sheep. But I just, I mean, Lord? Simon, son of John. Do you love me? Lord, you know all things. You know that I love you. Feed my sheep. I'll tell you something true. When you are young, you can go where you want. Dress yourself. Do what you please. But when you are older, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will dress you and take you where you don't want to go. Follow me. So does, like, everything have to be a teachable moment with him? All right, let's follow him. My name is Sarah Richards, and I am the kids pastor here at church, and I'm just very excited to be able to be with you this morning. Have to admit, a little nervous, but also excited to be able to share with you what Kids Ministries is all about and some things that are very dear to my heart. Before we get started, though, I just wanted to share with you a thought that I had as I was watching the kids sing just a few minutes ago. I just sat there watching them and had this thought all of a sudden, like, those kids in 20 years from now will be leading churches. They will be leading us. And what an amazing thing that is to be able to be a part of coming alongside God in raising those kids up to be leaders of our church in the future. So just keep that in mind as you listen this morning. But I wanted to give you a little background on the story that we were just able to watch and experience as they presented it so well to us. And as you saw on the screens, that's actually the story from John 21, 15 through 19. And that story actually takes place about a month and a half after Jesus has died on the cross. He rose from the dead and then he ascended back into heaven. And Jesus, since his death, had appeared to his disciples two different times. This is the third time that he's appeared to his disciples, and he appears to them as they're out fishing, as we saw. And he appears to them. They are out in the boat fishing. They've been fishing all night long. They hadn't caught a thing. In the morning, they still are fishing, haven't caught anything. And then they see a guy on the shore. They don't know who it is yet, but he tells them to throw their net on the right side of the boat. So they throw their net on the right side of the boat. I wish I knew what they were thinking right then, because I wonder if they were going, What? Who is this? Why is he telling us to throw it on the right side of the boat? Or I wonder if they were going, Haven't we heard that before? Didn't that work for us before when we were told to do that? So I wonder what they were thinking. But anyways, they did it. They threw their net on the right side of the boat, and immediately it was full. And they caught 153 fish. And Peter is on the boat. and Peter recognizes Jesus. So Peter, knowing Peter and how anxious he is, he jumps in the water, swims to shore, and meets Jesus on the shore. Jesus has a fire all ready to go, breakfast ready to eat. Then the disciples paddle the boat in and they all have breakfast with Jesus. Now this is also a story that I would love to be, I would have loved to have been there to hear the questions that they had for Jesus, the thoughts that they were thinking, what it would have been like to sit with Jesus and have breakfast. Jesus made breakfast for you. That's pretty amazing if you think about it. It's one of those stories, I always tell my kids this, that when I get to heaven someday, I hope that we get to see like Blu-rays of like the major events that happened. Like when the Red Sea was parted, or when Daniel was in the lion's den with the lions, I want to be able to see that stuff, how that stuff happened. This is one of those stories. I would love to have been there. But the disciples have breakfast with Jesus, and then Jesus asks Peter to go for a little walk. They go for a walk, and Jesus asks Peter a question three different times. He says to Peter, do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me? And Peter, all three times, says, yes, you know I do, Lord. You know that I love you. And then Jesus gives Peter an assignment. He says, Peter, feed my sheep. And he tells them three different times. I just want you to think about the significance of that question for a minute and that assignment that Jesus is giving Peter. Because if you think about this story, if you remember about a month and a half earlier, Peter denied even knowing who Jesus was three different times. He denied knowing Jesus three different times, and he had really, really messed up. And he knew it. So as Jesus is asking him those questions and telling him to feed his sheep, He knows he's messed up, but Jesus knew it too. And you know what? Jesus, despite the mistakes that Peter had made, Jesus wanted Peter to know that those mistakes did not and would not define who he was in Jesus' eyes. Despite the mistakes, Peter, Jesus was still asking Peter to lead his church. He knew that Peter, just like the rest of us, are a work in progress. But he was calling Peter to something way bigger than his past. Jesus had called Peter away from his old life and given him a new identity. Jesus knew who Peter was deep down inside, and he knew that he could trust Peter to take care and shepherd and lead his church after he left this earth. Now, we tend to be a lot like Peter. At least I do. Because Jesus has given us all an identity, and we tend to forget that really easily. We either get hooked into believing that our mistakes are what define us, or we start thinking that our abilities and our gifts and our talents are what give us our identity. But those things are not truly who we are. Our true identity needs to be found in who we are in Christ. we are who Jesus tells us we are and no one or anybody else only who Jesus tells us we are now this subject of identity stirs up some very strong emotions in me and partly it's because I am still in this process of learning that my true identity needs to come in Christ and also because I want so deeply for our kids to be able to find their true identity in Christ now most of you know my story and that I feel a very strong call in my life to be a kids pastor and that's a huge calling and a really great thing but it also has a dark side to it because it's really easy for me to start finding my identity in being a kids pastor or even in the things that I can do for God but that can get me into trouble because that's not what Jesus wants for me he wants me to find my identity and my worth in him and nothing else. I have to continually remind myself of this, and hearing stories like the one that we heard today of Jesus calling Peter despite his past help remind me where my true identity comes from. I've also learned that this process of finding our identity is an ongoing process. It's not a one-time thing. It's actually an endless process. And the only way that we can go through this process is with Jesus' help. We need to continually give ourselves to God and trust him as he walks us through this process. Now earlier, when Katie gave you the instructions on how to make the origami without telling you the end result, You had to trust her to get to the finished product, right? Yes? Yes. Thank you. How many of you had a hard time keeping up with Katie? Raise your hands. How many of you got a little frustrated? Maybe she was going a little too fast for you. Raise your hands. How many of you didn't even do it? Oh, come on. Well, you know what, you guys? That is just like our lives. Only God knows the end results of our lives, and only God knows the end results of our kids and what they will be like and look like when they get older. We cannot know that. We don't know that. And God knows the same thing about us, And sometimes it gets really confusing, and it gets really hard, and it gets frustrating, especially when we don't know what's going on, when we don't know the end result. And sometimes we just want to even give up. But that's why we need to trust God completely with our lives and with our kids' lives. We have to trust him even when we don't feel like it, even when we don't know what's going on, even when we're frustrated and confused. We have to trust him enough to call out the identity in us and to call out the identity in our kids. Our part as parents is to create environments where God can do that and then pay attention to what he's doing and join him in it. We will not be able to control what our kids look like when they become adults, but we can know that God has an amazing plan for each one of their lives and we get to be a part of coming alongside God and preparing them for that future. Now as a parent myself, it's really hard for me to admit to you right now that it's hard for me to give up control. I like to be in control. And I want to know that when my kids grow up, They will love and serve God with all of their hearts. But ultimately, it's not up to me. It is up to God to determine what my kids will look like and whether or not that will happen. I have to frequently remind myself that it is God who shapes and forms my kids. My husband and I, as parents of three boys, we get to come alongside God and partner with Him in that. That's why I'm so passionate about Kids Ministries, because I want our team of staff and volunteers to be able to come alongside parents and God to create environments where God can stir things and move things in kids in mighty ways. Our mission in Kids Ministries is to inspire kids to become fully alive in God. And one of the ways we believe that we can do that is by helping kids find their true identity in Christ. In addition to that and helping kids find their identity, we know there are many, many ways that we can inspire kids to become fully alive in God. But ultimately, we want to give kids a great foundation that will carry them into their future. We believe that if we can help kids know a few very important truths in their hearts and in their minds, that a strong foundation will be built and they will become and remain fully alive in God. So if you think about each child as having a container and every year we want to add things to that container so that when they get older, they have that container to go back to, we want to do that in kids' ministries. We want to add things to that container every year. So starting out in our early childhood ministry, which is our birth through pre-kindergarten area, we want to add these things to that container. container. We want to add, we want them to know these things. God loves me, God made me, and the Bible is God's story, and it's for me. Now, can you imagine if a five-year-old knows those things deep down in their heart and in their mind? That's pretty amazing. And then in elementary, we want to add more things to that container, and that's our kindergarten through fourth graders. We want to help them know these things, that God created me for him. God wants me to be a part of his big story. I need to hear, recognize, and obey the Holy Spirit. Now, imagine if your fourth grader was able to hear, recognize, and obey the Holy Spirit. Imagine going through life at fourth grade and already knowing that, knowing how to do that. I am still learning how to do that. I think that's awesome. Then in upper elementary, which is our fifth and sixth grade, we want to help those kids add a lot more to their container because we know that they are about to head into the junior and senior high years, which are not the easiest years of our lives. So we want to add a lot more to their container, and this is what we want them to know, that I am uniquely created and purposed. I choose to creatively use my faith to love and serve others, and I can regularly engage in God's big story. So as you hear these things this morning, I wonder if God is stirring something in you. Maybe he's calling you to be a part of our team. Maybe you feel a nudge. Maybe you feel a call. One of the ways that you can come alongside us and partner with us is by praying for the kids and the staff and the volunteers in our ministry. So when you leave this morning, you are going to get another piece of origami. Get the theme, everybody? Origami? You're going to get a bright color square of origami like this. And what I want you to do with it when you get it is open it up, because on the inside of it is the name of a child in our ministry. And what I want you to do is take that home, and I want you to pray for that child. All the kids that are in our ministry that attend regularly are listed in those origami squares. I want to ask you to pray for that child on a regular basis. I want you to pray that God would show them their true identity. I want you to pray that God would fill their containers with those truths that I just shared with you. And I want you to pray that they would become and remain fully alive in God. So would you please take that paper home, put it somewhere where you can see it, that it will remind you to pray for that child and hold that child up in prayer. I'd also like to ask you to consider serving on our team. Each weekend, our team of volunteers serves around 500 kids, and we need people just like you. Moms, dads, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, junior high, high school, college students, empty nesters, grandparents. We need all of you. And you know what? We need you even if you have messed up just like Peter did. Because we know that your mistakes do not define who you are. And we know that we all get do-overs. And so if you're one of those people that feel like you can't serve because you've made mistakes, I pray that you would just allow God to talk to you about that and that you would serve despite your mistakes. We need about 250 volunteers and about 140 people each weekend to serve our kids well. Currently, we have about 60 volunteers returning this fall. We still have not heard from all of them to know if they're coming back for the fall, but that means right now that we need 190 of you to say yes and serve in kids this fall. now the reason I say we need 250 people total is because we know that not all of you can serve every week we have a lot of volunteers who do serve every week but we also have volunteers who serve twice a month or even once a month so we'll work with you to figure out your sweet spot in serving and we'll also work with you to fit something into your schedule so if you feel God nudging you if you feel God calling you if you just want to ask more questions about it we'll be in the gathering place after the service and you can chat with us there. Now, this morning I talked a lot about kids and parents, but I wonder if God is saying something to you about who you really are. I just invite you to take some time talking to God about that and about who he really thinks you are. Maybe he has something to say to you that you have not let in yet. I encourage you to ask him to reveal to you who you are in his eyes. and then let that in. Can I pray for you quick? Lord, thank you so much for this story of Peter and of how Jesus, despite Peter's past, still calls him to serve him and to lead his church. What an amazing assignment that is. And Lord, each one of us have an identity in you, but we may not be able to see what that is right now. And so I pray that you would just help us see who we truly are in your eyes, and that we would let that sink in to the core of who we are. Thank you for loving us despite our mistakes. We love you in your name. Amen. All right, I am going to ask the rest of my kids' staff to come up on stage and join me, and I'm just going to introduce them quickly to you. And then we're going to do something a little different downstairs every weekend as the kids are leaving. we like to pray a blessing over them. So our volunteers pray a blessing over them as they leave, and we'd like to do that for you this morning. But first, let me introduce them to you. This is Annika Johnson. She is our early childhood associate. She oversees everything from birth through pre-kindergarten, and she is our resident early childhood expert. She knows what she's doing. This is Sue Kanegi. Sue is our elementary coordinator, so she oversees everything from kindergarten through fourth grade, and Sue helps us keep on track with the details. And this is Katie, who you all met earlier, and Katie, like we said earlier, she oversees fifth and sixth grade ministry. Katie, as you can tell from our origami experience earlier, keeps us all on our toes and makes sure that we're all having fun. Yes. So you guys, oh yeah. You guys, this team really does keep things in kids ministry going. I am so thankful for them and what they bring to the team, and you should be thankful as well. So we're going to pray that blessing for you as you leave, and then Steve's going to come up and wrap us up. Ephesians 2.10. We are God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. May you know that God created you for a special purpose. May God reveal to you that the life he prepared for you in advance is a beautiful calling. May you always remember who you are and who you belong to. Well, I get a chance to interface with these four regularly, and one of the things that they did leading up to the service for several weeks was fold about 2,500 little origami deals. So it's really important to you, to me, to all of us, that you take that thing lovingly and pray. And also, now, Sarah, I did notice that this is my son right here, Elijah. And someone better pray for this kid. This better not be sitting up here at the... Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, it's good. Just wanted to be covered. And then before I pray for these guys, you know, Sarah threw out a number, 190. That's a lot of people, right? And sometimes, you know, we say, oh, serve in kids' ministry. It'll change your life, and it'll be the best hour of your week. And I think those things are potentially true, but that's not why I think you should serve. I hope that happens I hope that's amazing what also could happen is it could be a super inconvenient time that you get up in the morning on Sunday and you could be paired up with a kid that kind of pushes all your buttons and it's hard and you could walk away going why in the world did I do this and that could be the very best thing in the world for you and for that kid so I want to ask you to say yes and even though it might inconvenience you even though it might really challenge you, even though it might really push you, because our kids are just that important. Amen? I mean, our kids are that important. So once a month, twice a month, every week, whatever it is, consider being a part of this amazing journey that God has us on, and do it because, frankly, we need you to do it, and our kids need you. Okay, let me pray for these wonderful women. God, thank you so much for Sarah and Annika and Sue and Katie and Lynn. And thank you for all the volunteers that make this ministry happen. And I pray that you would put your spirit in them to do what you're calling them to do. The huge, huge things that are at stake with our kids. I pray that you would give them everything that they need. I pray that you would raise up volunteers to say yes to this vision. so that our church can be a church that for years to come is filled with people who are growing and becoming fully alive in God. In your name, amen. Amen.
