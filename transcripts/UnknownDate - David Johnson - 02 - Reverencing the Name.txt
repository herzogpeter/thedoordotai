Let's pray as we go to the ministry of the Word this morning. Father, my desire is this, that we would be able to taste what the prophets and the psalmists and the rabbis tasted when they said, oh, how I love thy law, for it is sweeter than honey to my taste. I pray that you would help us know what Jesus knew. We're coming to know him as rabbi, and we think of him in growing up even as a young boy in Betsefer, in Betel Mood, as he learned the words of God, as he learned the Torah, that he knew these words were words of life. Help us to taste. Help us to know so we can come to love your words to us. I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Among the things that I have found quite fascinating thus far in the series of sermons that we're referring to as the way of the rabbi Where we're coming to know jesus as a rabbi is this idea that jesus was himself a torah observant Jew that he wasn't a christian Which I know sounds weird maybe even Disturbing but if you think about it even a little in the context of history It's it's obvious that jesus was in his humanity and in his his life experience, a Torah observant Jew, the Torah. We began to talk about last week his first five books of the Old Testament. It's also referred to as the Pentateuch or the law, which means, among other things, that what formed the mind of Jesus as a young boy, again, in Bet-Sephar and Bet-Talmud, the Hebrew school that he undoubtedly went to, and what stirred his heart, indeed, that served as the backdrop and the basis of his message and his mission, was entirely the Old Testament, particularly Torah. Which is why last week we began to examine what I believe can be argued as the centerpiece of Torah. The Ten Commandments is found in Exodus chapter 20, in part because I want us to go back, and this is kind of hard to do, but as best we can, I want us to go back and in some sense be formed by what formed Jesus, our rabbi, the law. Now, among the things we learned last week that helped us get a picture of why the prophets and the psalmists and the rabbis so loved the law of God, calling it sweeter than honey to their lips, was because at one level, the law of God, particularly Torah, was just practical advice on how to do life, and how to do life well in the kingdom of God. And indeed, literally, the Ten Commandments are referred to as the ten great words for life. The decalogue is the actual word. Deka meaning ten, log, or logos meaning word. They are the ten great words for life. The psalmist said it this way in Psalm 119. Thy word, your law, the decalogue, thy words to me are like a lamp unto my feet. How helpful is that? It's like a light to my path, showing me where I should go because it's helpful and showing me where maybe I shouldn't go because if I go there, I'll fall into a hole, I'll go over a cliff, I'll ruin my life, I'll mess up my marriage so, oh, how I love your law. It's such a help because it enlightens my path, helps me know where to go, where not to go, so I don't get hurt. But the fact is this. Not all of us have that response to the law. Indeed, for many of us, this concept of law, not just moral law, but even civic law, not just God's law, but man's law, either one, for many of us, it stirs in us feelings not of joy, but of restriction, even sometimes fear, which is why last week we spent some time explaining some things about the law that we need to understand if we hope to ever experience the law as life and joy, not death and fear. The first was this, got to get this, that the law, particularly the Ten Commandments, the Decalogue as revealed in Exodus 20, was never given as a means by which people could earn the love and favor of God, which is vitally important to understand, because if you use the law of God, the Ten Commandments, whatever, the law of God as a means of believing that if you do it, God will now like you, the law will always become fear and death. Indeed, the very introduction to the Ten Commandments we discovered last week makes it very clear that the people to whom these words were originally given already had the love and favor of God. Exodus 20, verse 2, says, For I am the Lord your God. In other words, I already am the Lord your God. That's not up for grabs here. That's already a done deal. Who has already brought you out of the land of Egypt? Who has already brought you out of the house of slavery? You are already redeemed. Which makes the law not a means by which people can be saved, but rather an incredible gift and a wonderful resource designed to help the already loved and redeemed people of God learn how to live in and remain in the freedom that they already have and not be subject again to a yoke of slavery like they had when they were in Egypt. But further, we discovered last week, law was designed to help the people already redeemed by God, already loved by God, to begin to step into and experience the fullness of their destiny as the people of God where they are actually beginning to become what God designed and desired them to be, a light, the light of the world, a kingdom of priests. So how do you become the light of the world, a kingdom of priests? How does that actually happen? Well, here's a really good place to start. Begin to learn, people of God who are already loved by God, already redeemed by God. Begin to learn what it means in your everyday life to put God first and accept no substitutes. Begin to learn what it means to revere his name, observe his day, honor your parents, be faithful to your one and only spouse, and you will by that begin to step in. You will begin to become the people God called you to be. In other words, as you begin to get your life in order, this is language that we're a little more used to around this, as you begin to get your life in order under the rule and reign of God, you'll not only remain in your freedom, not go back to slavery, but you'll actually begin to step into your destiny, actually becoming the light of the world, a person who actually is capable of partnering with God in his mission in the world to bring what we've been calling around here tikkun olam, the healing of the world, and that's what we're all about. How do you start that? Learn what it means to put God first, accepting those substances. Now, last week, we looked at all of that in the context of those first two commandments. Comparing them, actually, if you were here, you remember this because it's a vivid analogy. We compared the Ten Commandments to wedding vows where we promised our faithfulness to God to have and to hold from this day forward, and that's the energy that's behind no gods but me. You shall not make for yourself an idol, which is just another way of saying, I don't want any other lovers. We're entering into a marriage here, no other lovers, no other gods. Today, I want to look at all of this in the context of the third commandment in the law, the commandments, the Decalogue that forms the mind and the heart, the message and the mission of our rabbi, revere his name. Jesus said it this way when he was teaching his disciples how to pray in Matthew 6. Pray then this way, our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. The text actually, Exodus 20 verse 7 says it this way, you shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. That's the kind of phrase we're most used to. Thou shalt, it's kind of a negative place, Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. Why? And how does that affect my ability to stay in my freedom as a person of God? How does taking his name in vain affect my ability to step into the fullness of my destiny as a person of God? Well, to answer that, let's begin to do some work. Don't take it in vain. Let's look at the word vain. A word in the original Hebrew speaks to nothingness. It means worthlessness, uselessness. So don't bring my name to a place of nothingness, where it is reduced to worthlessness, uselessness, where it no longer has any meaning or value. Interesting, it's the same word that Solomon uses in Ecclesiastes when he says, all is vanity. Everything is useless, in other words. In fact, what Solomon is saying there is this. So all these things that I've been pursuing all my life to find life are absolutely useless, vain, empty, void of meaning and value. It's the opposite meaning of the word honor that we'll deal with in Exodus chapter 20 verse 12 where it says, You shall honor your father and mother. Interesting word, quite nuanced and rich. Honor refers to something that has weight, that has substance and influence. So don't reduce my name to something light. Don't reduce my name to something lacking substance. Don't reduce my name to a bumper sticker cliche, to a slogan for your cause, to a swear word for your frustration. Do not reduce my name to triviality. But we do it all the time. often in fact I think most times without knowing it even in church I think we do it resulting in a kind of idolatry which is weird I mean we don't always connect this up but these these words really do blend into each other because the idolatry comes when we develop a false perception of the real and the reason we develop a false perception of who God really is is because in ways that we're not even always aware of, we have reduced his name to something trivial or vain, useless, worthless. David McCullough in his book entitled The Trivialization of God says this, just visit a church on Sunday morning. Almost any will do, and you will likely find there a congregation relating to a deity of their own creation who nicely fits into their preconceived notions and reduced perceptions of who God actually is. So we come up with a God who guarantees our comfort, who promises our success, who supports our cause, and winks at our sin. He sees you when you're sleeping. He knows when you're awake. He knows if you've been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake. So God, you know, nobody, nobody, you know, says that out loud. We'd spot that. But, you know, all of a sudden God is Santa Claus. God is, God is a genie in a bottle who, if I pray the prayer the right way, I get whatever I want. People kind of offended by that go the other way. God's not a Santa Claus. He's a state trooper, and he's giving you a ticket. I mean, his fundamental function is to pull you over. God is the force. God is whatever it is you perceive him to be. But in all of that, in ways, again, we do not even know, his name has been reduced to a caricature of who he really is. And the danger of that, well, I know the danger, God gets mad about that. Well, okay, it's worse than that. Well, although that would be pretty bad. The danger of reducing the name of God is this, that if the name of God is reduced to triviality, to vanity and emptiness, it raises this question, why on earth would anybody take him seriously if his name is reduced to uselessness, triviality, why would you take seriously any call to devotion, sacrifice, obedience, pursuit? Why would you follow him? I mean, in the course that we're in right now of following the way of the rabbi, why would you follow the rabbi if he's just surrounded with and our understanding of him is just full of triviality and shallowness? Well, the answer to the question is you wouldn't. Fact is, most people don't. Most people don't. I mean, it's as simple as this, on a very human level. If every time I heard your name or you heard mine, it came in the context of derision, sarcasm, ridicule, or condescension, like, you know, he's a really nice guy, but he's not too bright, you might be polite to me if that was your perception. And I might be polite to you if that was my perception of you. But when it comes to serious issues related to my life, my work, my marriage, my money, my direction, I would not likely, be likely, to take seriously at all your opinion or advice about anything. I might be nice to you, go to church on Sunday and tip my hat to you in some sense of the metaphor. I might act like I'm listening to you, but I would in fact ignore you. Which is precisely what most people, even most people in church, do with God. We're polite. Follow? In actual aspects of my life that would affect my life? Are you serious? It's a Santa Claus we're talking about. Because when the name of God is reduced to triviality, you pretty much destroy the possibility of reasonably intelligent people ever entering into a serious life of devotion, obedience, submission, or pursuit because you've effectively eliminated the possibility that in that name there might be some wisdom, hope, help, healing, power. So why would you go there if there isn't any wisdom, power, healing, or hope there? You wouldn't go there. Most people don't. We talked about this earlier in this series as it relates to Jesus as well, again, as the rabbi who says, come follow me, come follow me, because many think of Jesus as a kind of dreamer, an idealistic guru who had some nice religious ideas, and we'll tip our hat to him relative to that arena, which for most of us has no connection with actual life. Dallas Willard quite bluntly says all this this way, that very few people, including Christians, actually find Jesus to be a person of vital relevance to the course of their actual lives. Fact is, he is not generally regarded as a real life personality who deals with real life issues, but rather is concerned with some feathery realm, not like the one with which we have to deal and deal with every day, which raises this question, if that's true, why on earth would you follow him? Fact is, you wouldn't. Most people don't, at least in part because his name has been reduced, often by shallowness to triviality, making him very easy to ignore. So what I want to do in the rest of the time that we have left is to consider some ways that we often unwittingly reduce the name of God. In fact, as it happens in a variety of ways, some are obvious, others more subtle. Among the more subtle would be this. It's mindless overuse. The mindless overuse of the name of God can reduce the name of God to triviality. What are you talking about, Dave? This is what I'm talking about. And if you've been around church very long at all, you know about this. There is a kind of Christian subculture God talk that can become a kind of babble. No one understands it but us. Indeed, outside the context of a church, some of the ways you hear Christians talk, it makes no sense at all. And to the ears of unbelievers, we don't think this. We think we're being very spiritual when we have all our little God cliches. But to the ears of unbelievers, it actually reduces the name of God to a cliche, to a slogan, to a pattern of speech. I've made reference many times because it's part of my story. It's part of how I kind of see the world. even the kingdom of God. I grew up in church. And when I was growing up, we all had the victory. It was the victory. You got the victory. I got the victory. Nobody knew what the victory was, but we all had it. Victory. And having the victory was always followed by, bless God, hallelujah, praise the Lord. Yes, sure. Whatever that means, you had a cup of coffee. I got it. This is a good cup of coffee, bless God, hallelujah, praise the Lord. What? What? What? What does that mean? Why did you say it? Does it actually mean anything at all? Or has it become for you just the way you talk? Without thinking at all about what you're saying or how you talk? Or how in ways you do not mean at all. You are reducing the name of God to a stupid cliche. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. See, I think there is a kind of God speak that becomes mindless drivel. Hear me. No longer subjected to the scrutiny of actual thinking. We just blather on about how God did this and God did that. And if my week didn't go well, it was the enemy. It was all about the enemy. Really? How do you know? Have you thought about that? Or is that your explanation for everything? Because if it is, it's a real easy way to live. But it's, whoa. See, after a while, I really, again, this is so unintentional. After a while, though, we don't even know what we're saying ourselves. I think we think we're being spiritual. People think we're weird. And the name of God is reduced to a cliche, to a slogan, that no thinking person would take seriously. And if you don't take God seriously, why on earth would you follow him? You wouldn't. Most people don't follow him. We blather on about him, but follow his way? It's a whole different thing. A few weeks ago, I was channel surfing. Do that one in board, just the ADD. Just go boom, boom, boom. Don't want to miss anything. Might be something up there. you know, anyway, oh, brutal, and I came to, I don't know what your TV thing is like, but on the cable we have, there's this, there's this block of stations, you have to go way up high, but there's this block of stations where Christian TV comes on, religious TV, and, and, oh boy, I don't, I don't want to be mean, I really don't, and I'm, I, I don't want to offend, but if I do, my email is kmireatthedoor.org. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm doing that in all three services too. And Lord, I just want to keep my... I don't want to do this. I kind of want to do this somehow with a hug. But most of what I saw, not all, not all, but most of what I saw reduced the name of God to something ridiculous and vain that, actually, I wish was ignored, but people notice. And in some cases, makes the name of God a joke. Not only ignored, ridiculed. The fact is, I can't hardly go into Christian bookstores anymore for all the Jesus junk. Those are two words that don't belong together, Jesus junk. that reduces the name of God to something we can sell. I'm in so much trouble. To a slogan on my T-shirt. And I'm not wanting to go to war against bookstores, but I'll never forget. I mean, there's these little things. Some of them are really irritating, and some of them are just whatever. I'll never forget the time. You've seen these. I went to a cash register, and there were some breath in this there called Testaments. it's just and I'm saying it's evil I don't call it evil it's just like what? weird Jesus is my homeboy great funny because most of us think God's angry at the pagans for taking God's name in vain for bringing God's name and reducing it to a swear word and I'm going to talk about that in a few moments here but the truth might be and before we get to the pagans I think we need to look at the ways in which the reality might be that most of the damage to God's name might be done by us, reducing his name by our shallowness to triviality. So what's the problem? Here's the problem that makes it almost impossible to take seriously God's name. And if you don't take God seriously, why on earth would you follow him? You wouldn't. don't. Second, the name of God is reduced when we use it to manipulate and control people. Now, the first thing I talked about is kind of irritating and, you know, let's just kind of wake up. This one is very damaging. So when I attach God's name to my opinion, to my agenda, and then use God's name on you to get you to do what I want. And if it's ever happened to you, you know exactly what I'm talking about. One of the most obvious manifestations of this is when people misuse prophetic words. We believe that God speaks prophetically to his people and to his church and treasure that gift. It's why we have to be very careful about how it is used. But if you've ever had anyone use God's name on you to get them to do what, you know, the Lord told me this. And if the Lord told you and the Lord said, then how on earth can you argue with that? I not only have to deal with what you think I'm supposed to do, it's really not even you. I can't even have a conversation with you. God wants me to do that and how to untie all that. And you know what it makes me want to do? Run! Not only from you, but from God. If that's who God really is. If that's what he's really saying. But most of the time people speak for God. God's not speaking! When it's this minute. It's kind of like, maybe this is a way to see how we do it. It's kind of like little kids. And if you have little kids, maybe more than one, you've seen them do this where one of the kids is trying to get their brother or sister to give them something or do something they want. And they say, Dad said you're supposed to. And Dad hears that and goes, wait a minute, don't be using my name to get her to do what you want. Have your own relationship with your brother or sister. It's called spiritual manipulation. It results in spiritual abuse, and it reduces the name of God to your need to control another person. It's not okay. And part of the damage it does, as we're talking about how the law, when we really enter into this and learn what it means to revere the name of God, can help us come into our destiny as the people of God. The damage at this level, when the name of God is reduced to your agenda, is that it actually makes it incredibly hard for people to really move toward the name of God unguarded. Because if you get enough experience around this kind of misuse of his name, every time you hear the name, you're going to have to wonder at least a little bit, is this really a prompting of the Spirit? Is this really the authentic voice of God? Or am I being manipulated again? And some people have the energy to work through that and figure it out, and hopefully you're in a community that can help you do that. But sometimes the best way to handle that, or at least the only way you see to handle it, is to go, you know what, this whole thing is a bunch of baloney. I just got to get out of here. And out of here means away from God, his people, the whole deal. Matthew 5, 34, Jesus said, don't make vows. Don't make vows. What about wedding vows? Well, listen to what he's saying. What he's saying, don't be saying, I swear to God, as God is my witness. Why? Here's why. Because most of the time when people are saying, I swear to God, as God is my witness, what they are doing when they do that is using God's name to get you to believe them. Therefore, to get you to trust them. Is what you're telling me true? I swear to God. Well, then it must be true. don't you dare take my name says god and use it to manipulate people to get them to do what you want or to conceal your lie just he goes on to say just let your yes be yes and your no be no just talk straight and think about what you think i'm saying or not saying because most of what you say I'm saying, I'm not saying. Now you might want to write that down. Ezekiel 22 verse 28 says this, they see false visions and divine lies, saying, thus saith the Lord when the Lord has not spoken. Question, why would anybody say, thus saith the Lord when the Lord has not spoken? Why? Because they're trying to get you to do something they want you to do. It has nothing to do with... God, I hate it when you do that, says the Lord, because it reduces the name of God to triviality on one hand, to your personal agenda on the other hand, thus making it very difficult for people to ever move toward God unguarded. Interesting verse related to this, just kind of a piece of wisdom on this. slow us down a little bit. Ecclesiastes 5 verse 1 says, Guard your mouth as you go to the house of God. Draw near and listen, rather than offer the sacrifice of fools, blathering on. Do not be hasty in word or impulsive in thought, for God is in heaven and you are on the earth. Therefore, let your words be few. what's weird that verse lands on people and there are some people who need to speak more I just got to trust that that's going to land where it needs to land third and most obvious way that the name of God is reduced is when we use it for profanity this without a doubt is the example with which we're most acquainted in fact when we think of taking the Lord's name in vain Well, you think of people who use it for profanity when the name of God is reduced to a curse. Indeed, so common is this, that those who do it often mean no direct disrespect to God. I mean, they don't know God well enough to even, I mean, it's just become a figure of speech, much like the way I think sometimes we mindlessly use the name of God because it's become just this figure of speech. We don't even know what we are saying. Sometimes when it's reduced to profanity, the people who are just going on and on using the Lord's name in a profane, cursing way don't even connect with it. They just use it every time they're surprised. Every time they're disgusted or in pain or feel angry. Every time they miss a putt, it means God's name is invoked in the green. It's interesting. You know it's true. we live in a culture that is obsessed with language and whether our language is politically correct. But it's strange as it relates to this. Social convention is not careful here around the name of God. And I'm not getting on a soapbox about that. The problem is this, that that's when the name of God is just routinely used for profanity, for a curse. The obvious result is that his name is reduced. But the real problem in this isn't the swearing, though we find that very offensive. The real problem is that when the name of God is reduced, in any way it is that it's done, whether it be through triviality or through profanity, the real problem with it all is that it ultimately makes it easier to ignore, to avoid, to not take seriously God. And if you don't take God seriously, why on earth? would you follow him? Why on earth would you submit to him, obey him, serve him? You wouldn't. Most don't. But here's what's weird. In spite of all that, in spite of all of these ways, subtle and not subtle, that the name of God is reduced, the name of God still stands. Why? I mean think about Dallas Willard says this and here he's talking about Jesus not as rabbi as we're coming to know but he's talking in this quote he's talking about Jesus who is the fullness of God the exact representation of his nature Willard says this 2,000 years ago Jesus was ignominiously executed between two thieves yet today it's weird from countless paintings statues and buildings from literature and history, from personality and institution, from profanity, popular song and entertainment, from confession and controversy, from legend and ritual, the creator God, as revealed to us in Christ, still stands at the very center of contemporary worlds, of the contemporary world. Why? Why has he mattered so much? God and his son Jesus, the exact representation of his nature. Why not only has he mattered, but does he still matter so much? And still have effect. It is weird. Still today, 2,000 years later, there'll be a picture, a feature story in Newsweek, Time magazine on Jesus, three or four times a year. Why? Well, maybe it's because there's more to the name than we know. More than even our best and worst efforts to diminish that name have been able to accomplish, which is why the psalmist said in Psalm 34, verse 3, Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. In fact, it would be a good discipline, a spiritual discipline for the people of God. It's why we worshiped the way we worshiped. You might have enjoyed the worship, but you didn't know that intentionally, because we were talking about this, we picked certain songs that hopefully would magnify. Because a good disciplinist or the people of God recognizing we have a tendency to reduce the name to on purpose magnify the name together. Let us exalt his name together. In fact, as we were thinking about this this week, we thought it would be a good idea to try to do that. Having in a variety of ways in this sermon talked about the ways we reduce his name to close this sermon by on purpose magnifying the name, by on purpose exalting his name together. Kind of, you know, when I think of magnifying, you think of maybe something's really tiny and you use a microscope to make it look bigger. When I think of magnify, I think of something infinitely large and we use a telescope to try to get our head around something that is magnificent. But as I thought of how to do that, the first thing that came to me was to do that well, we need to borrow the language of the poets. Artists and poets are somewhat similar in what they're trying to do. Sometimes artists will paint a picture and the beauty is in its realism. They'll paint a bowl of fruit. or they'll paint a scene of some sort and it looks like a photograph. And it's so real. Other times, artists are moving at something else and it's called impressionistic art where they say something, they write something or they paint something and you can kind of tell basically what it is. But it's designed to move you somehow and it actually brings you into a number of different places. Poets are often that way. It's not even so much about how technical they are. It's designed to move you, to magnify something, to exalt something. And as I thought of what I could read that would magnify that might just exalt what poet, the poet I thought of was a guy named S.M. Lockridge, who maybe most don't know him as a poet. He was actually a preacher slash poet, an African-American preacher, who says fundamentally this. Here's why this name still stands. But even before I read what he wrote, you'll have to forgive S.M. Lockridge here because he's a little bit biased. about this name because he obviously loves the name. Here's why the name of Jesus still stands. It's because he's unparalleled and he's unprecedented. Jesus, you see, is the centerpiece of civilization. He's a superlative of all excellence. He's not only the sum of human greatness, he's the source of divine grace. He's the wellspring of wisdom. He's the doorway of deliverance and the pathway of peace. He's the roadway of righteousness and the highway of holiness. He's the gateway to glory. He's the all-sufficient king. He's the king of the Jews. He's the king of Israel. He's the king of righteousness, and he's the king of kings. He's the king of heaven. He's the king of glory. He's the king of kings, and he's the Lord of lords. There is no gauge to measure his limitless love. There is no barrier to block his blessings outpoured. He is enduringly strong. He's entirely supreme. He is eternally steadfast. He is immortally faithful. He is empirically powerful. He is impartially merciful. I wish that I could accurately describe him to you, but he's indescribable. He's incomprehensible. He's invincible. He's irresistible. You can't outlive him, and you can't live without him. The Pharisees couldn't stand him, but they found they couldn't stop him. Pilate couldn't fault him. Herod couldn't kill him, death couldn't conquer him, and hell couldn't hold him. He's the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. He's the God of the future and the God of the past. And we rise to speak his name over and over again, for he is the source of life. And that is why we say, hallowed be thy name. And that is why you shall not take the name of the Lord thy God into vanity, into triviality. And so let's not. Instead, magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name. together. Let's stand. Holy, holy are you, Lord God Almighty. Worthy is your name. Worthy is your name. You are holy, holy. Are you Lord God Almighty? Worthy Worthy Oh, you are holy Holy Are you Lord God Worthy is the Lamb for you are holy, holy. Are you Lord God Almighty? Worthy is the Lamb, worthy is the Lamb for you are holy. Holy are you, Lord God Almighty. Worthy is the Lord. Worthy is the Lord. You are holy. Welcome. I am Lord God. The name of God is reduced. It makes it less likely that people would follow, that people would come for hope or healing or wisdom. But when his name is magnified and exalted, and we begin to get a glimpse of who he is and what he does, hope begins to rise, and it increases the likelihood that people might actually follow or come for healing or hope. And so with that in mind, I'm just going to ask as we close, and I'm not going to drag this out at all because you'll just be dismissed, but I'm going to ask the prayer team to come. Just make yourself available to some among us who may need to come to God for help, for healing, for a way to come back to him. And there will just be people here to pray for you. Lord, we do confess the ways we've reduced your name to triviality. And we would also confess that most of us don't know we're doing it when we're doing it, and we don't want to do it. We want to learn even more what it means to revere your name so that even in our own spirits, realistically, we would take you seriously. Because we take you seriously, things like obedience and sacrifice and service is the only logical thing to do. So, Father, we just pray that you would be with us where we are in this journey. And those who need to meet the mighty name and be affected by the mighty name of God today would come for prayer. Or even where they are to be aware of you in them, around them. Holy Spirit, come in Jesus' name. Amen.
