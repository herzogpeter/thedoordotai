Good morning. Our scripture reading today is taken from John's Gospel, the third chapter, verse 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life. And also Acts chapter 1, verse 8, which states, But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Well, it's delightful to be with you all again this morning. I promise you I am not auditioning for a job up here. It's been twice in five weeks. I get that. But to give you a sense of how this all went down, Dave had asked me this last fall if I could take this weekend and the message for this weekend, so several months ago. And he texted me about two weeks ago and said, Peter, you still can do the weekend of the 22nd, 23rd. And I went, you know, because I've got five kids at home. And so a successful day for me is basically to get them where they need to go, to have them mostly fed, some socially acceptable clothes, and that I love on them a bit. And so two weeks out basically falls in that part of my calendar, which just says Jesus might return. Don't worry about it. I can't tell Dave that in this text. And so I said back, oh, absolutely, Dave. The sermon's actually, in fact, already done. I'm praying over it now. I don't know what you're up to. I don't know. I'm just delighted to be here. That's what I know. I know the kingdom of God is real. That's what I know. And I know for my 20 plus years here in this place that I've met many people that, like me, would declare we have decided to follow Jesus. There's no turning back. And when we decide that, you don't know what the future looks like. So it's really true that our calendars probably should say he may return. Let's just keep walking it out, keep walking it out with the life of God. And I'm delighted to be here with you in that place. So Lindsay just read a section of the text that will be able to tie into where we've been these last few weeks as a church. And specifically that word from the book of Acts, chapter 1, verse 8, there's a little word in there that is this word witness. And as we get started this morning, I want to land on that word for just a few moments before we start tying this into where we're headed. But to be a witness in the biblical sense of the word means that you have more than just a capacity to relate the basic facts of a story. Or you have more than the ability to tell someone out loud, you know, Jesus died on the cross and was raised from the dead. That if confronted in a relational situation, what do you think about Jesus? Being a witness is more than just telling the facts as they are. because in a biblical sense, to be a witness means that one's life is somehow incarnating in the world around us, the realities of who God is. It's a truth that shapes the way we understand and even experience the interactions of this world. For there's a power at work in those who are a witness. It's a power of the Spirit made possible through the life and death and resurrection of Jesus. And it's a power so strong that it becomes nearly undeniable when it's seen in its fullness. It's palpable when it's put to the ultimate test. For in the early church, followers of Jesus, as we know, were often killed for their faith, brought into the Roman Colosseum for sport, put to death in a variety of means for the entertainments of the masses. But it was in that place that their witness was never stronger. The power of God never more fully known for as the lions came and the gladiators swung, the followers of Jesus were known to confront their death with a power so present that the people who came into the Colosseum to witness their death, to mock and to jeer them for their faith, so moved were they by the way in which these people greeted their death that they actually turned and were converted themselves. And more people left the Colosseum, believers that day, than died in the midst of it. So the Greek word for witness in the New Testament is the word martus, which ultimately forms the basis for a word familiar to us, which is that word martyr. And so the early church people were declared martyrs for the faith, simply meaning they were the fullness of the witness of the kingdom of God. All of which made me ask a question of myself this week. Is it possible that this power is available to us today? Some 2,000 years after the life and death and resurrection of Jesus and the power of the spirit and our Christian brothers and sisters who died for their faith, is that power still here? What would that look like? So keep that in your mind's eye. It's a question we'll return to towards the end of the text. We have a little work to do first to connect this question to where we've been in the sermon series. And in fact, start walking through this lovely and beautiful and actually stunning little verse in the text. So familiar to all of us, which is John 3.16. So with that, let's go ahead and pray as we begin. God, just grateful for this space. Grateful for the worship, for Joel leading us in prayer. together, and somehow the words of your kingdom as we're in this space just don't seem far away. So in all of the various realities of our lives, the pain in which we're in, the turmoil, the joy, the sorrow, I ask again that you would greet us here in this time in the word. In your son's name and by the power of your spirit. Amen. So if you've been here the last few months, how many of you have been here the last few months as we've been going through questions, right, related to some key questions Dave has been addressing related to things like who is God or who are we both individually and as a church. And recently, over the last two weeks, Dave has bitten off this question that has gone something like this, what is the gospel? And over the last two weeks, Dave has been outlining the gospel, anchoring it in some of the early verses of the book of Mark in which Jesus declares that the kingdom of heaven is near you, that the way in which Jesus is and is in this world and his kind of life is available to those who would like to live within the rule and reign of his kingdom with Jesus as the king. And that is good news because Jesus is restoring all of that which has been lost. So wherever else the gospel is, It is people being invited to live in the realities of Jesus in his way of life with him as the king. I don't know about you when you've heard him talk about the gospel in this way. I find my heart resonating with the words that Dave is saying. And even as I've sat, many of us are kind of going, hmm, yeah, hmm. I've even said out loud a couple times during those last few messages, yes. And then I think I just got to shut up for a minute. But it seems like we're resonating with this idea. But if you're like me, there's a little piece of me that says, well, Dave, this isn't the gospel I grew up with. This sounds nothing like it. In fact, the gospel that I grew up with was something very different, anchored in this verse, John 3.16, about this capacity to do something with God to make sure that I get into heaven when I die and I avoid hell. and that's the good news. That's the gospel. And I teach some of this in the places where I am at both Bethel, at the seminary, and at Northwestern University. And in my classes, there are always about 25 to 30 kids or students that many of whom have come out of the evangelical churches like this. And they represent churches all around our state, all around our region, even all around our country. And we begin to talk about the gospel as being this reality that Jesus has made available his way of life, that his kingdom is here, that his power is present, that we can live within the realities of it. In class after class, over 10 years of teaching, it's the same kind of response that I just said. Well, I'm intrigued by that. And yeah, I want to live in that. But Kapsner, this isn't the gospel I grew up with. This sounds nothing like it. So we have some fun in those places and we begin to wonder about how the gospel was presented in our churches. And specifically, we end up getting into this famous passage, John 3.16, that always comes up. Because sure, you know, Peter, we can talk about this kingdom of heaven now, but we're talking about parish meaning hell and everlasting life meaning heaven. And you just need to believe something and then that's all sorted out. That's the way it was taught. And in fact, John 3.16, for me, one of the famous places I saw growing up was always on the TV. I think we have some pictures of that. It always came out in sporting events, didn't it? There was the people that had the billboards, right? And they must have planned like years in advance about who was going to maybe win the World Series, and they get the signs. And it's right there. This is two years ago when the Giants and their little dynasty they have going on right now. Won it again, and the last pitch, John 316, is right there. Or there's another picture of my favorite guy growing up. This guy was at every NFL game somehow. You remember him? And I don't know how he did it because there's lots of kickoffs at noon, but he happened to be at every single game. You could have the NFL ticket turn on any game and every extra point, he had his billboard up and it was John 3.16, saving the world through the NFL. It was fabulous. So we talk about that and then we talk about some of the stories. And I don't know if this will be familiar to you. It certainly is to me as we've constructed this story about how John 3.16 then was used in our church. And I started telling the story. I remember from my youth group in which our youth pastor would come to us as kids in the youth group and say, next week, I am going to give the gospel message. We're like, all right. He says, now I want you to go home, and I want you to ask God to put on your heart, pray a bit, put on your heart somebody that you're supposed to invite that would hear the gospel for the first time. Like, oh, okay. So I go home, maybe 16 years old, and then go into my room and pray and think, okay, God, put somebody on my heart, put somebody on my heart, put somebody on my heart. Larry, Larry, Larry, Larry. Oh, Larry. I don't even like Larry. Larry lives down the street and I don't really ever talk to him, which is going to be awkward to invite him to church for his eternal destiny here shortly. So I go to Larry and I show up, but I'm not going to tell Larry that it's going to be about the gospel message. There's no way. I'm going to use the classic bait and switch technique here, right? Okay? I'm going to say, Larry, I go to church on Wednesday nights. It's a youth group. Super fun, Larry. There's great food. We play lots of games. You might meet some cute girls. There's great music, great band. Just come on along, Larry. Give it a shot. I've got the bait. You know, it's dangling. Bait. Oh, that sounds pretty good. Has no idea what's about to hit him. And I make sure to tell Larry I'll pick you up at 6.30 because I don't want Larry to try to make his way there by himself. I don't want the responsibility for his eternal future on my hands, right? So I need to make sure I get him there. So I pick up Larry, get him into church. We play the games, eat the food, listen to the music. Hour and a half in, Larry's pretty softened up. It's exactly what we were looking for. You know, you get him kind of dialed in. You know, kind of like you're comfortable in the seat. Defense is down. Pastor stands up, reads John 3.16. And then he asks the classic question. anybody know a question I'm about to ask if you you can even say it with me if you'd like if you die tonight do you know where you would go and softened up Larry it feels like he stuck his head out a car window going 90 miles an hour and his face is just flattened so then the pastor says well you can make your destiny sure John 3 16 God so loved the world he sent his only son. Whoever believes in him will not head to hell, but head to heaven. So just pray a prayer after me if you want to do that. And there's always that caveat too, which is, and if you don't remember the exact day and time you prayed that prayer, go ahead and pray it again today. So then we'd bow our heads and close our eyes and repeat after the pastor, dear God, I'm sorry I'm a sinner. Dear God, I'm sorry I'm a sinner. Please forgive me of my sins. Please forgive me of my sense. Invite me into heaven when I die. Invite me into heaven when I die. And then the pastor says, if you prayed that prayer for the first time tonight, just look up and catch my eye. And I don't know about you, but I have prayed that prayer for the first time at least 12 times in my life. I do remember one time where it's very awkward, where the pastor knew me well. I was actually doing some of the teaching as part of that, and I was so terrified by the invitation. I looked up and caught his eye. And he looked at me like, whoa, wait a second. And I've said it before, but my name is all over the Lamb's Book of Life. I have like the speed pass lane when I get to the pearly gates. So I told this story so many times over the years in teaching with our evangelical kids and good kids. And I don't want to say, I just need to step aside and say, I know a lot of people have walked in kingdom life, have begun the journey in that way, I get it. I really do. I really do. And I want to honor that and bless that. But as I go to the kids then, and we talk about this, and we're laughing about our experiences that are shared, and I'll ask them the question, so what if John 3.16 is teaching far more than just this idea about how to get into heaven when we die. It's like this. It's silence in that moment. The kids are confused and intrigued, and we really have this lovely time over the next six or seven class periods just breaking down this passage of Scripture, just exegetically. We're a bunch of nerds in this class when we really start walking through it, and it takes a long time to do that. And I want to try to do some of that with us here this morning, but I recognize that instead of six to seven class periods, we have about six to seven minutes. And so I'm going to throw a lot at you from this verse just to wonder about, related to it, just to kind of help our thinking and connect it to where we've been with Kingdom Life now. But it's going to be the CliffsNotes version or the SparksNotes version or whatever version they use these days. I have no idea. So I'm just so irrelevant. I don't know. my students are like face gramming and insta-chatting and I'm not even sure what they're all doing. But there's five things in particular to pull out of this verse, just quickly to try to reconstruct a paraphrase of what this wonderful and beautiful invitation is in John 3.16. And so first we start, and it's I think important to know that the verse starts with a God of love. For God so loved the world. And I don't know what you're thinking about God the Father and Jesus the Son is. And again, the pictures you have, I know for much of my life, Jesus and God existed in sort of this good cop, bad cop relationship, right? Where God the Father is sitting on some sofa in heaven with his arms folded, and he's mostly just mad. And he kind of, you know, if he had a shot to sort of unleash a little bit, he'd wipe a few people out. But every once in a while, Jesus passes in front of his eyes and kind of, you know, distracts him a little bit and makes sure that that doesn't happen. there's just so much in there about how we got to our perceptions of this God of primarily anger but it's a God primarily of love that moves towards reconciliation only getting angry as a last resort when something about his way of life is being threatened and so it's through love that he begins to move and it's towards love that we walk in this verse it's towards love that we walk it's the first thing. The second thing now going through this verse, for God so loved the world that he sent his only son. So whoever believes would be a good place to stop and look at this word belief just briefly. For again, when I hear this word belief, I think of something that I can give kind of an assent to that I could agree with. Like I agree or believe that water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen, like a fact. Or I believe that Pluto was a planet when I was growing up and somehow it's not anymore and that kind of wrecks my childhood. Whatever else is in this word, believe, it contained within and again in the original language, the way they would have heard it when it was first said by Jesus was this invitation that is to fully lean into, believe in Jesus, to fully surrender, to bend one's knee would be a way to say it from the Greek. It's not just this idea of I ascend to something. It is a wholehearted response of I will yield and I will bend. And what's beautiful in this verse, and again, this is that exegetical nerddom stuff, but I like it. And within this word believe, it's not a one-time action. In the Greek language, It's a continuous activity. It's a continuous reality. It is something that you do more than just once. In fact, it begins as you do it over time to lean into and to surrender and to yield and to bend your knee. It becomes the very posture of your heart towards the king. Knowing that it's his kingdom that rules and reigns. I will yield and bend my kingdom to that. It becomes the very posture of one's life. So it's towards love that we move. And as we do, we, like Paul, die daily. We bend our knee to the king. And I know many of you know exactly what I'm talking about, what it's like to get up in the morning and say, okay, I'll do it again. I'll bend again. There's no other life, right? God so loved the world that he sent his only son. So whoever bends their knee continually, walking this out in that way, will not perish. And now here's that key word, right? Because for many of us, perish meant hell. growing up. It was a synonym for that. But again, within this word perish might include some concept of a distant reality absent from God, but a phrase that's very compelling within this word perish literally means to be rendered useless. To be rendered useless. Meaning that if I'm living my life in such a way that it's not one of continually bending my knee towards the king of a posture of life. The pathway in which I am on is a useless pathway. There is no power in it. There is no future to it. It will ultimately perish because there's only one kingdom and one king. And I can do a lot of stuff of building my kingdoms and I do that stuff. I know when I'm doing that. And it feels great in the moment, but looking ahead, it all perishes. There's one way of life. For God so loved the world that he sent his only son. So whoever is continually bending their knee, dying daily, waking up again, yeah, walk it out again, they have a future. They have a hope. They're not part of a path that will perish. So the fourth and fifth parts of this verse, and again, lovely little verse, have to do with this last part, and that is, for God so loved the world that he sent his only son. So whoever is continually bending their knee, surrendering into, leaning into, will not have a useless existence, but will have the power of the kingdom. In fact, they'll have something called everlasting life. So doing those two words together, they're often paired together in the Gospel of John. The word everlasting there does not mean some kind of infinite time in heaven. Actually, if we think about it, infinite and time, they sort of don't make sense anyway, right? But everlasting is the sense of the word is it is indestructible. It's permanent. It is something that cannot be assailed, and it's something that cannot be overcome. It is absolutely everlasting. No matter what comes against it, it will persist. It will remain. It will be there forever. And what is that little thing that's forever? Well, it's that last word in the verse, and it's this great word that John uses some 36 times in his gospel over and over again. It's the word life. so we have some words up on the screen to just help walk through this last part briefly that pulls it all together but within the greek language there are three possibilities john could have used for the word life there's bios he could have used this word which if that sounds vaguely familiar it's the root of biology it has to do with like i'm alive and studying that i have skin and flesh and how I am just a living being. John didn't use that word. So whatever else we're talking about in John 3.16, it's not about having some living existence everlasting, as if I'm alive. He could have used the word psyche, which has to do with the human personality or will or volition, but he didn't use that one either. Much better word he chose. It's a third word that he used, and it's this great little Greek word, zoe, which when defined simply means the essential kind of life that belongs to God. It's the very kind of life that God enjoys. Remember Dave talking about that stuff when we are the image of God on earth in the garden, the image of God filled with the kind of life that God might enjoy before we took the bites of the fruit? This is the kind of stuff we're talking about here. It is the essence of God. It is the life of God. Not that we're God in and of ourselves, but we begin to be filled with the realities of who God is. For God so loved the world, lost in its brokenness, and it's creating its little kingdoms all the time. That he sent his son to remind us of what life is supposed to be like. So bend your knee to the son continually, ongoing, forever, and you will not have a useless existence. In fact, you will once again be filled with the kind of life God enjoys, and that life is everlasting. It's a beautiful passage. James Edwards in Christianity Today writes this about the kinds of life in this gospel. He says, By us and psyche are, to be sure, gifts of God and creation, and they're inherent to human life. But the third kind of life is not inherent to human life. Not all people have it, and those who do have it receive it only as a gift of God through Jesus Christ. Zoe is the life that characterizes God and the life that God wills to impart to his people. Frederick Bruner writes in his commentary on the Gospel of John, there is no passage in John where life does not primarily signify a present state rather than some future immortal bliss. So the invitation is lovely. I haven't known when we die? Well, of course. I can't wait to walk in and see the other side. As one who I hope is learning to bend their knee continually, to bring the kingdoms that I so easily start putting into place that have no future and no life, I hope that my life is one in which, your life is one where we're continuing to bend our knee again and again into the rule and reign of who Jesus is and then coming to the other side. Now I get to be in this in its fullness. And that kind of life is everlasting and it's indestructible. And in fact, when Jesus says, and now another familiar passage that might make more sense to us, there's this passage where he says in John 10.10, I have come that you would have life and have it abundantly. You would have my Zoe coming into your character the way that I am. I will teach you how to love those who hate you. I will teach you what it means to have peace in the midst of profound, difficult circumstances. When that diagnosis comes, there will be a peace that passes all understanding. It doesn't mean I'm not sad. It doesn't mean I'm not broken. It doesn't mean I want my life to come to the end. But in that place, there is something indestructible. There's my way of life. And there's a peace that passes that. And you might even be able to bless those who curse. And you may be able to walk out of your need to spin all of people's opinions to your favor. You may be able to even possibly stand in a coliseum and die. Maybe that's what they were tapping into is this kind of stuff some 2,000 years ago that the kingdom of heaven was here. So whatever else you think about abundant life flowing through, when I hear about abundant life, my mind goes, well, if I just pray the right prayer and think the right thoughts, then I'm guaranteed to have a house out in the suburbs of the fence and two dogs and three kids, and everything's going to be just lovely, abundant. Bing! You know, I don't have white teeth, so I can't do that very well. But that's the message, right? Bing! It's all going to be fine. We know it's not all fine. But we know that in the midst of the all not fine, there's a life there. For what if God was real? And what if Jesus' kingdom was still here among us? Because maybe in those nights when my wife and I are having an argument, they always happen late at night with five kids, right? It's always like midnight, you're completely tapped. And yeah, I have a PhD, but that hasn't prevented me from sleeping on the couch many nights. Right, honey? But can we, in those difficult places, find a kind of life, instead of asserting my kind of kingdom, to win an argument? Ah! Kills a relationship. What would it be like to be in Jesus' kind of kingdom in those moments? What would it be like to live in the realities of that? I'm so compelled by some of the language Dave has been using about being radically committed to spiritual formation not as some nice little game that makes us feel better about ourselves but if we become fully alive with this kind of life that language that we use around here so often becoming fully alive with God it's actually anchored deeply in John 3 16 it's the abundant life of the kingdom of God. And it points to the glory of God and for the richness of our lives, as he's been saying, but it's also for the sake of the world. Which then pulls me back in the remaining time that we have to that question about the martyrs. And what kind of life must they have had? And I don't know if you want to do this. You don't have to. You can in these moments. I spent some time this past week trying to transport myself back into that Roman Colosseum. And standing on the dirt in the middle with the crowds jeering and imminent death coming. And how would I have greeted that? Because it's part of me, if the gospel is just about making sure that I've done a ritual with God that somehow secures my destiny, and I can point to the date that I did that. So, God, you're on the hook because I have the date. If that's what it's about, making sure, then I might just pray that prayer, oh, I don't know, about 12 more times in that moment in the Colosseum. Please give me, please give me, please give me. Okay. I was talking with the message team this week, and have you ever toyed with the idea if you were forced to renounce your faith of maybe just going ahead and renouncing your faith and asking for forgiveness later? I know I have. But is there a different kind of life available? What was this witness that the martyrs had back then? Well, I spent some time just looking back through history in some of the words of these martyrs, famous people, early church, incredible description of who they were and what kind of life available to them well after Jesus had been raised, well after he had ascended. It's a life that persists now. Let me just read to you in our remaining time a few of these descriptions and passages from these people. The earliest first person account of martyrdom comes from Ignatius, the bishop of Antioch. Early part of the second century, Ignatius had been arrested and was being transported to certain death in the games of the Colosseum at Rome, where he was to be taken apart by the wild beasts for the amusement of the crowds. While being transported to his death, Ignatius writes in a passionate and candid terms of one who knows he's going to die. But he welcomes his impending death as a chance to witness to the faith. His letters show an acute self-awareness of himself as a public figure. And he wrote to exhort his readers to be willing to imitate the passion of Jesus. He writes, quote now, the unbelievers bear the stamp of this world, their own little kingdoms. But the believers, animated by love, bear the stamp of God the Father through Jesus Christ, whose life is not in us unless we are ready of our own accord to die in order to share in his passion. And so he pleads with the other believers to not try to interfere on his behalf. I beg you, do not show me unseasonable kindness. Suffer me, he writes, to be the food of the wild beasts, which are the means of making my way to God. For God's weed I am. And the teeth of the wild beasts, I am to be ground that I may prove Christ's pure bread. What kind of power was in that man? What kind of life of God? What did it look like for him to be walking out daily, continuing to bend his knees? So in the end, that was what he said. Another one second of three origin, another church leader of that time says this. And so I am ready to die for the sake of truth. and so in the face of so-called certain death, I scorn it. So come wild beasts, come crosses, come fire, come tortures. I know that as soon as it is over, I depart from my body and I am in peace with Christ. So let us take up the battle and take up the struggle. Groaning, yes, at being in the body, but not as if once in the tomb we're coming back to this body, persuaded that we will be set free. the last one in the martyrdom of polycarp relatively famous martyr story and there's thousands of them just go look them up who indeed is the writer saying here would not admire the martyrs nobility their courage and their love these are eyewitnesses of what's going on in the coliseum their love of the master for even when they were torn by whips until the very structures of their bodies were laid bare. They endured it, making even the bystanders weep for pity. Came into the Colosseum, mocking and jeering, and they saw the faith and the witness of those dying, and they began to weep for pity. Some, in fact, indeed, attained to such courage that they would utter not a sound or a cry, showing to all of us in that hour of their torment, these noblest of Christ's witnesses were hardly even present in the flesh. Rather, the Lord was there present, holding converse with them. So fixing their eyes upon the favor of Christ, they despised the tortures of this world. Of which Tertullian finally writes, another major church figure, for by this means of martyrdom, we see all sins can be forgiven. That is why we thank you immensely for your sentences of condemnation, Rome, and your little kingdom. For such is the difference between the things that are human and the things which are divine. I would just hazard a guess that none of us are going to have to die for our faith, but there are those people all around this world doing just that right now. They're doing that just right now. And even if we don't die for the faith, the invitation to the power of the life of the kingdom is the same. It doesn't matter if we're in the wealthy western suburbs of downtown Minneapolis or in the fields of Iraq. The call is the same. It doesn't matter. Because as we're filled with the life of God, as we bend our knee continually to the king, he begins to inhabit us with that kind of Zoe. And regardless of where we are, the world can begin to see it. It invites people back into the rule and reign of who Jesus is. So move towards love with a continued bent knee so you have a future that is not useless but will begin to be inhabited with a kind of life of God that even in the Colosseum is indestructible. Dallas Willard's paraphrase of John 3.16 is one of my all-time favorites. He says, God's care for humankind was so great that he sent his unique son among us. So whoever counts on him, leans into him, surrenders into him, will not live a futile and failing existence, but will have the everlasting life of God himself. Love that paraphrase. It's John 3, 16. It's a great invitation into life. Heaven when we die, yes, but there's something far larger at play. Why don't you stand as we close? Say it all the time, I don't have any fancy benedictions. Someday I'll stop apologizing for that. But the thing that occurred to me as part of the journey with you is that we as Open Doors just continue what we're doing. Continue to work out our salvation in fear and trembling. For God is at work in us in his power to will and to act according to his good purpose so we shine like stars in a crooked and perverse generation. Be at peace as you go. God bless you
